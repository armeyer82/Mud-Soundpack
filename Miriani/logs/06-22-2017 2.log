00:24:43 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

00:35:22 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

00:38:26 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

00:41:51 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

00:47:26 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

00:52:01 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

00:53:56 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly east.

00:55:10 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

00:55:20 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
01:14:44 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:17:51 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

01:17:51 This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

01:23:44 You can go out.

01:23:44  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of white socks.

01:23:45 You are carrying nothing.

01:23:56 You sniff absently at the air.

01:23:59 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

You can go east, south, and west.

01:24:18 You sit down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:24:19 Morris Corlew waves to you.

01:24:21 You wave.

01:24:23 You say, "Hi all."

01:24:40 Rogue Romano says, "Yo."

01:24:46 You grin.

01:25:11 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

01:25:41 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:28:02 Rogue Romano blinks heavily and then dozes off.

01:29:40 Morris Corlew says, "Think I'm gonna go snuggle for a bit."

01:29:41 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:29:43 Morris Corlew waves.

01:29:44 Morris Corlew lopes south.

01:29:49 I don't see that here.

01:29:52 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi Lily. Bye Lily."

01:29:57 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi hi."

01:30:00 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:30:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "I will check our course."

01:30:04 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

01:30:04 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

01:30:08 Lily Kaise waves and waves.

01:30:09 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:30:09 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Hi Lily."

01:30:14 You wave to Lily Kaise.

01:30:21 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:30:26 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:30:27 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:30:29 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:30:31 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:30:34 Cheri Lindbergh wraps her arms around herself.

01:30:36 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That the drive?"

01:30:39 Lily Kaise hugs Cheri Lindbergh.

01:30:42 Lily Kaise grins.

01:30:44 Cheri Lindbergh says into the PA microphone, "No."

01:30:44 You smile.

01:30:49 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ah ok. Thanks."

01:31:13 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "So what's up in here?"

01:31:23 You say, "Just checking our course."

01:31:28 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ok."

01:31:31 Lily Kaise grins.

01:31:33 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

01:31:34 You grin.

01:31:37 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

01:31:37 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

01:31:41 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:31:51 Lily Kaise says, "Going to go look in on critters."

01:31:53 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

01:31:55 Lily Kaise glides south.

01:32:56 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

01:33:44 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:33:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:33:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:33:55 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:34:00 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:34:00 A riftstorm appears to be 1.9 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic South and Slightly Down.
A riftstorm appears to be 17.6 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Up and Slightly Northwest.

01:34:04 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

01:34:12 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

01:34:17 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

01:34:17 Cheri Lindbergh says, "That's a lot of water."

01:34:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "8 to 9 LTC. Depending on where we hit exactly."

01:34:31 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

01:34:49 You grin at Nissi Valdaire.

01:35:41 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

01:37:59 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:38:05 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:38:08 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

01:39:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:39:32 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:41:41 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:43:56 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:43:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:48:09 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:48:10 Lily Kaise glides south.

01:48:43 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow Earthgate is 78."

01:48:56 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:49:02 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:49:41 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:53:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:53:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:54:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:54:42 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:55:41 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:59:41 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:00:42 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:01:16 I don't understand that.

02:01:44 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters into the room.

02:01:48 Magellan the arachnoid security robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks.

02:01:48 Lily Kaise pats a magician's top hat lightly.

02:01:51 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters south.

02:01:51 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:01:57 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:02:23 Lily Kaise grins at you. "That sly Magellan."

02:02:31 You chuckle.

02:02:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:03:56 The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.

02:04:28 Eli yans, releasing a long stream of bubbles.

02:04:33 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Yawns."

02:04:41 Lily Kaise chuckles at Eli Grey.

02:05:00 You grin at Eli Grey.

02:05:47 [MTTS] Ulias: The fishbowl riftscape always makes me think of the underwater saloon from "Top Secret"

02:05:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:09:41 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

02:09:41 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

02:10:19 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

02:10:26 You wave to Vernos Bailey.

02:10:52 Vernos Bailey waves.

02:10:59 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:11:13 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:11:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo storm."

02:11:56 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "We might hit its very edge!"

02:11:57 Vernos Bailey asks, "Going to miss both?"

02:12:20 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:12:34 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:12:56 Nissi Valdaire says, "This seems weirdly gusty for not being in a storm."

02:13:07 Lily Kaise nods.

02:14:18 The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.

02:15:35 Ather Jammoa says, "I guess the closer we are to the edges of the storms the more of their effects we get."

02:15:50 Ather says to Nissi, "How far were we at the last time we stopped to check?"

02:16:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:16:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "8.5 or 9 to go depending on which beacon you ask."

02:16:33 Ather Jammoa says, "I would've figured we'd be in the range of the temporary beacons by noright."

02:16:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I often talk to beacons."

02:16:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe, no harm in trying."

02:17:01 Ather Jammoa says, "Then we probably need another probably 2-3 LTC to be in range of the temporaries."

02:17:05 Nissi Valdaire nods.

02:17:53 Ather Jammoa chuckles. "Can't believe we went that far from farport."

02:18:06 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

02:18:06 Ather Jammoa strides south.

02:18:13 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

02:18:15 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

02:18:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "A lot of drift over a 4000 lightyear trip. You'd sort of expect it to average out after a while but I guess not."

02:19:09 Ather Jammoa says to Nissi, "Yeah, that's what I'd have thought too."

02:19:20 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe there's a prevailing coreward flow."

02:19:41 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

02:19:41 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:19:51 You wave to Sarah Bellamy.

02:19:59 Sarah Bellamy waves to you.

02:20:02 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:20:23 Ather Jammoa says to Nissi, "Only thing that'd really explain it. I saw the flow move rimward almost as much as I saw it move coreward."

02:22:23 Nissi Valdaire says, "Something to keep in mind. We'll only be able to confirm it with future long trips if it's really a thing."

02:22:30 Ather Jammoa nods.

02:22:44 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:23:20 Ather Jammoa says, "See, in this particular illusion, we are probably the fishbowl inside of Pierre's hat, and whenever Pierre starts running, the water does this."

02:23:27 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:23:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I think is easier to just blame strange storms for everything."

02:23:34 Sarah Bellamy chuckles.

02:23:36 You grin.

02:23:49 Ather Jammoa says, "And now Pierre is huffing and puffing because he's out of breath and he's like "fuck...this...I...can't...run...any...more.""

02:23:50 Two massive hands reach down and pick up the fishbowl, jostling and sloshing everything inside.

02:23:50 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

02:23:53 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

02:24:02 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh my gosh pierre has big hands."

02:24:10 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

02:24:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It is true."

02:24:14 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:24:14 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

02:24:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I am shaking."

02:24:32 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:24:32 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

02:24:44 Nissi Valdaire grins.

02:26:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Pierre is running from a maple syrup thief."

02:26:22 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Go pierre go!"

02:26:23 Eli says to Nissi, "One thing too, is that I noticed that a lot of earlier stops kept beign more and more southeast."

02:26:38 Eli Grey says, "So it wasn't all drift necessarily."

02:26:49 Aisling the Fox says, "Dreaded not-drift."

02:26:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah maybe."

02:27:05 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:27:05 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

02:27:19 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:27:19 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

02:27:40 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well if it's true then on a long enough trip we'll always end up pushed coreward. So we'll just have to pay attention and see if that happens."

02:27:45 Ather Jammoa nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:28:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah. I mean, I figured we might've been pushed 10, 15 LTC's coreward, but no more than that. Even with our shift coreward a few LTC in order to find new things, I'm still surprised we were pushed so far."

02:28:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:30:01 Eli Grey says, "We can call this phenomonon the Corwardening."

02:30:11 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

02:30:39 Vernos Bailey says, "Coreward Drift Theory."

02:30:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It is universe way to tell us to aim and fail for a galactic core journey."

02:30:46 Eli Grey grins at Vernos Bailey.

02:30:56 Eli Grey chuckles at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

02:31:04 Eli Grey says, "Yes. Coreward is calling."

02:31:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Or maybe just the Jinu."

02:31:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Call the Accord right now."

02:31:40 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:31:40 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

02:31:59 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:32:00 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

02:32:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We have proof that Lowell must be deployed fast, although it does not use rift drive."

02:32:11 Eli Grey grins.

02:32:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:32:55 Lily Kaise says, "I rather like the fishbowl theory."

02:33:21 Eli Grey says, "I wasn't even saying the one part was really any kind of permanant thing, I think it was probably a coincidence that the discoveries were more coreward each time, just wanted to point it out since it would be hard to tell from the logs."

02:33:48 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

02:33:48 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

02:33:53 Eli Grey says, "We'd go straight down, and somethign would pop up Eastish of us, then we'd go straight down and the same thing would happen heh."

02:33:58 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

02:33:58 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

02:34:14 Eli Grey says, "At least for the ones I was awake for."

02:34:27 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

02:34:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Akemi is not here to run the calculations. We will have to make do."

02:34:36 Eli Grey says, "Oh, thank goodness."

02:34:36 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh dear. Pierre has been caught."

02:34:37 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

02:35:05 Ather Jammoa asks, "Now we are in the scenario of...hmm, who do we know who use to drive hovertrucks?"

02:35:31 Eli Grey points at Tegan the small circular sanitation bot.

02:35:46 Ather says to Eli, "How dare you insult the source of my effections?"

02:36:13 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.

02:36:13 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

02:36:15 Eli Grey says, "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you two were so close."

02:36:26 Eli Grey says, "Also, didn't know that driving a hovertruck was an insult."

02:36:32 The wind abates for a moment.

02:36:32 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

02:36:34 Eli Grey says, "Will have to file that one away."

02:36:37 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

02:36:56 Eli Grey says, "Start calling folks hovertruckers."

02:37:03 You chuckle.

02:37:59 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.

02:37:59 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

02:38:14 The wind abates for a moment.

02:38:14 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

02:38:14 Eli Grey says, "I wish I had a chance ot meet this Akemi, she definintely wrote some informative books and seems to have had quite an impact on everyone. Makes me wish I had said more to her when I ran into her at Scientia briefly."

02:38:35 Ather Jammoa says, "Eh, I wasn't overly fond of her QE shorthand book thing."

02:38:47 Ather Jammoa says, "The only thing that was good about that book was the hyperwave comms stuff."

02:38:52 Eli Grey says, "Despite their being plenty bad about her in the news, most of you folks seem to have liked her pretty well."

02:39:01 Eli says to Ather, "Oh, I haven't read that one actually."

02:39:42 Eli Grey says, "I always just figured I'd wing it mostly for an entangler message."

02:39:47 Eli Grey grins.

02:40:10 Ather Jammoa says, "I want to send them a message saying athr lking 4 omnlcks wll pay wll."

02:40:27 Ather Jammoa says, "Or wll py gd."

02:40:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "Akemi had a lot of potential but paranoia got the better of her."

02:40:36 Ather Jammoa nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:40:49 Ather Jammoa says, "And I'll never understand why she did what she did."

02:40:51 Lily Kaise says, "That's one way to put it."

02:40:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:42:25 Ather Jammoa says, "There is no way that storm isn't pushing us back south pretty annoyingly right now."

02:42:38 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

02:42:39 Ather Jammoa strides south.

02:42:44 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.
A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

02:42:45 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

02:42:56 The wind abates for a moment.

02:42:56 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

02:43:06 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

02:43:22 Ather Jammoa says, "81%."

02:43:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Deploy the mizzen."

02:43:57 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Aye aye!"

02:44:01 Nissi Valdaire grins.

02:45:05 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.

02:55:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Interesting storm."

02:55:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:56:00 Aisling the Fox says, "Gusty storm."

02:57:19 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.

02:57:43 The wind abates for a moment.

02:59:23 Vernos Bailey says, "Should be getting close to the edge of comms range."

03:02:09 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.

03:02:09 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

03:02:28 The wind abates for a moment.

03:02:28 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

03:03:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Can check chart after we are pass storm or such."

03:04:12 Aisling the Fox says, "Chart the chart for charting."

03:04:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:08:34 The wind abates for a moment.

03:08:34 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

03:09:34 Vernos Bailey says, "This storm is the most odd off all of them I got to see this trip."

03:09:43 Vernos Bailey says, "Of I mean."

03:10:14 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo 83."

03:10:22 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:10:27 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:10:32 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:10:44 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:18:54 The wind abates for a moment.

03:18:55 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

03:19:13 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please note: we are going to drop out to check for temporary beacons!"

03:19:20 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right...now."

03:19:23 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:19:28 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:19:32 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No beacons in range."

03:19:38 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:19:38 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:19:40 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "You are not in range."

03:19:42 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

03:19:47 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Urface."

03:19:48 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

03:19:57 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

03:20:00 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:20:12 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Some are... just... out of range!"

03:20:17 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:20:25 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:20:32 Lily Kaise grins.

03:21:57 The wind blows without control; the sky flashes with bursts of radiant lightning.

03:21:57 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

03:22:19 The wind abates slightly as thunder continues to roll across the plains.

03:22:19 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

03:23:42 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

03:25:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:27:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:33:53 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

03:34:02 Lily Kaise says, "Aww were up to 10K for a bit there."

03:34:14 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:34:19 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:05:26 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

04:05:36 Sarah Bellamy says, "Interesting."

04:06:42 Ather Jammoa says, "That one we've discovered before, I'm 90% sure."

04:06:53 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it seems familiar."

04:07:01 Sarah Bellamy nods.

04:07:17 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

04:07:17 Ather Jammoa strides south.

04:07:41 Lily Kaise says, "But it's close into comms so not worth much even if it werent' already discovered."

04:07:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:08:13 Vernos Bailey says, "Well it hasnt been hit with the scopes and such."

04:08:48 Lily Kaise says, "Still doubt anything close to comms will yield a lot."

04:18:43 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

04:18:58 Sarah Bellamy beams at Morris Corlew.

04:19:04 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:19:05 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:19:09 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

04:19:12 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

04:19:24 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

04:21:53 Sarah Bellamy says, "MMmmmm."

04:21:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Because I am busy working out those spinwarder scribbles."

04:21:58 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

04:22:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is not easy."

04:22:08 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I knew there was a reason you were telling grand flatout lies."

04:22:18 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Your face is a lie."

04:22:26 Sarah says to Morris, "How are you?"

04:22:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The fox speaks truth. I always wanted to ripe it off to reveal true face."

04:23:52 Sarah Bellamy says, "Seepy oosey."

04:23:55 Sarah Bellamy says, "Moosey."

04:24:00 Sarah Bellamy says, "My tongue is not awake."

04:24:10 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh my gosh pierre is taking so long why is pierre taking so long."

04:24:19 Morris Corlew nods. "Yeah I hear ya."

04:24:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes, yes."

04:25:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Closest seems to be Reach at 4.64, north and very slightly down."

04:25:46 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:25:48 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow, you have tha tsaved?"

04:25:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Coreward reach?"

04:25:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:25:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:25:56 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:25:59 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

04:26:00 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:26:00 A readout shows Remains of the unclaimed 138th about 19.33 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northwest and Slightly Up.

04:26:01 A readout shows Remains of the unclaimed 138th about 19.32 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northwest and Slightly Up.

04:26:05 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

04:26:08 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh wait, I think I have coreward reach saved too."

04:26:11 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Splash."

04:26:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why not? Is popular departure location, such as for aquarium."

04:26:23 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Why would you not pin Coreward Reach?"

04:26:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is also most coreward beacon."

04:26:40 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I said it looks like I have it!"

04:26:51 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, the coreward beacon reason is probably the reason I saved it."

04:26:59 Lily Kaise says, "And the bubble and such."

04:27:04 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "You sounded surprised that it was though."

04:27:07 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

04:27:27 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am always surprised at my own foresight!"

04:27:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So humble."

04:27:45 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Surprised by reflection in mirror. Surprised and horrified."

04:27:50 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Urmom."

04:28:09 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyway, we should probably hit the orion beacon fairly soon."

04:28:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Storm will push us around a bit, should not matter at this distance."

04:28:22 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

04:28:42 Lily says to you, "All relative."

04:28:44 Lily Kaise grins.

04:29:23 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "OK, we are going to turn off CR pa so we can talk bad about Aisling again."

04:29:52 Morris says to Lily, "Y'all are relatives?"

04:29:56 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

04:29:57 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

04:29:57 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:30:03 Aisling the Fox knocks on Ather Jammoa's head.

04:30:10 Ather Jammoa pats Aisling the Fox on the back.

04:30:14 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:30:15 The klaxon continues to sound.

04:30:15 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

04:30:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bweep, bweeep."

04:30:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Should probably check for the orion beacon in an LTC or so."

04:30:35 An underwater current slams into the side of the starship with intense force, shaking the starship violently.

04:30:35 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

04:30:41 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "We're gonna explode!"

04:30:54 Lily Kaise says, "Wooooosh."

04:32:49 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

04:32:49 Ather Jammoa strides south.

04:32:59 Lily Kaise examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

04:33:05 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Lily Kaise removes a small round personal kitchen sink pizza from the open compartment.

04:33:06 Damien Goss stands up.

04:33:07 Damien Goss steps south.

04:33:16 Lily Kaise dangles a small round personal kitchen sink pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

04:54:02 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "I left my duct tape on my other workbench. Sorry. Anybody got some chewin gum?"

04:55:51 You hear several rattling sounds, followed by a loud bang, as the starship is subjected to ever increasing pressure.

04:56:03 An underwater current slams into the side of the starship with intense force, shaking the starship violently.

04:56:40 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

04:56:42 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:56:47 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:56:47 A readout shows Remains of the unclaimed 138th about 18.83 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westsouthwest and Very Slightly Down.
A riftstorm appears to be 3.25 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic South and Slightly Down.

04:57:21 Eli Grey asks, "The unclaimed 138th?"

04:57:21 Sarah Bellamy eats a spoonful of drippy ice cream from a cold cherry cola float.

04:57:37 Aisling the Fox says, "Aisling's 138th. I claimed it."

04:57:37 Lily Kaise says, "Yep we've been seeing that for awhile."

04:57:43 Vernos Bailey says, "Say did we not just pass that a bit ago."

04:57:43 Eli Grey asks, "What does it mean unclaimed.. We just don't know whose ships they are?"

04:57:45 Morris Corlew says, OOCly, "Trying to ignore it. I think it's a bug. I supported it."

04:58:24 Eli Grey asks, "Or perhaps it was an unregistered fleet?"

04:58:27 Eli Grey shrugs.

04:58:33 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Ah, my bad."

04:58:55 Eli says to Lily, "So Lily..."

04:59:02 Lily Kaise says, "Well when we left the rift storm, the sensors likely went back up to full so this is why we may be seeing it again."

04:59:14 You nod.

04:59:15 Eli says to Lily, "What exactly is the story behind your forty pizzas?"

04:59:21 You chuckle.

04:59:26 Lily Kaise asks, "Huh what?"

04:59:30 Morris Corlew says, "They seem to reregister the storms when they get so far away from us."

04:59:45 Eli says to Lily, "Or was that a different Lily."

04:59:56 Eli says to Lily, "You know.. your forty pizzas."

04:59:57 You say to Lily, "I think he was referring to your Horrible People card."

05:00:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:00:54 Eli Grey says, "Lily's secretly the notrious Pizza Bandit."

05:01:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:01:04 Lily Kaise says, "I guess it's because I have historically fetched a bunch of pizzas for the expeditions I've traveled on. Not sure I ever got 40 though. Maybe 10 or 12."

05:01:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:01:14 Eli Grey grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

05:01:16 You laugh.

05:01:18 Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise.

05:01:40 Eli says to Lily, "Is that where all the pizzas in the fridge came from?"

05:03:46 Lily Kaise says, "Yup it was."

05:04:02 Lily Kaise says, "I usually get some too so I have pizzas for the lizie."

05:04:40 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:04:44 Lily Kaise says, "I don't like to feed her sandwiches and rice and noodles because she eats the paper and all or the bowls too."

05:04:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:05:50 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

05:05:56 Lily Kaise grins.

05:06:17 Sarah Bellamy eats a spoonful of ice cream from a cold cherry cola float then stirs the drink, blending the ice cream and beverage together.

05:06:24 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew on the lips.

05:06:27 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cafe Pepe Sangria.

05:06:31 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cafe Pepe Sangria.

05:06:33 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy on the lips.

05:06:33 You examine an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

05:06:33 What would you like?

[1] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio
[2] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel
[3] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir
[4] Cafe Pepe (Secret Recipe) Sangria
[5] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco

Enter your selection:

05:06:34 You help yourself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:06:38 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

05:06:38 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:06:46 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

05:06:51 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:06:58 Sarah Bellamy upends a cold cherry cola float and drinks the rest of the creamy beverage.

05:07:03 Lily Kaise says, "The sangria was good with the taco pizza."

05:07:31 Rogue Romano stretches and yawns, completely relaxed.

05:08:01 Lily Kaise asks, "So is the plan to depart again this morning or does anyone know?"

05:08:04 You wave to Rogue Romano.

05:08:19 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno."

05:08:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Pretty sure all of us are staying aboard if needed."

05:08:54 Rogue Romano waves to you.

05:08:57 You say, "But some of us need to reset robots and such."

05:09:02 Lily Kaise says, "Well need to do some things and think others do as well."

05:09:28 Morris Corlew says, "Yep. Need to build a new set of stations and get 'em on the constructor, for one."

05:09:30 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

05:09:38 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

05:09:40 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

05:09:45 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

05:09:55 Lily Kaise says, "Need to be sure Evenia has enough parts and reset robots and rebuild a scooping station."

05:09:59 You nod.

05:10:04 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:10:14 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:10:23 Vernos Bailey says, "I need to tell her we are going out again if so."

05:10:29 Vernos Bailey says, "That way she still cares for my felo."

05:10:35 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh yeah buy some more pizzas!"

05:10:38 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

05:10:40 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:10:50 Vernos Bailey pats a personal pizza oven lightly.

05:10:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Tons of pizza."

05:11:06 Lily Kaise says, "That's not particularly high on the list though sice we have the great services of the pizza oven here."

05:11:13 Lily Kaise chuckles.

05:12:20 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

05:13:10 Lily Kaise says, "Wow 8 AEU active right now."

05:13:20 There appear to be about 22 pilots recently active.

05:13:20 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:

* == Out of communications range

% == Detected via Quantum Entanglement comm
Additionally, there are 14 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 36 pilots.

05:13:20 Morris Corlew considers a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator thoughtfully. "Nice."

05:13:27 Lily Kaise nods and smiles.

05:13:28 Vernos Bailey says, "Looks like most of them are out of comms though."

05:13:32 You grin.

05:13:33 You nod.

05:13:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Enough for a cruiser!"

05:14:52 I don't understand that.

05:15:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

05:15:43 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

05:17:09 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

05:17:19 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

05:17:25 Morris Corlew says, "Oh a squid."

05:17:26 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh you just stay out there dude!"

05:17:26 Morris Corlew grins.

05:17:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:17:43 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

05:18:01 Lily Kaise exclaims, "The good thing is we don't see both of those eyes!"

05:18:02 You say to Lily, "You sure you don't want to catch that squid and eat it?"

05:18:09 Lily Kaise says, "Uh no."

05:18:09 Morris Corlew says, "Calamari."

05:18:16 You chuckle.

05:18:27 Lily Kaise says, "Never have been a calimari fan."

05:18:43 Lily Kaise says, "I do love most all seafood though."

05:18:49 You say, "Ah, one of the few seafood type things that you don't like."

05:18:51 Rogue Romano says, "I love me some calimari."

05:18:55 Lily Kaise grins.

05:19:08 Morris Corlew says, "Never went for that fancy stuff. Gimme some fried catfish any day."

05:19:18 Lily Kaise says, "Hey if it's offered, I'll eat it. I don't hate it it's just a bit tough."

05:20:06 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:20:07 Morris Corlew lopes south.

05:20:22 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

05:20:37 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:20:44 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

05:20:46 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

05:20:49 Rogue Romano presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

05:20:51 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:21:02 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:21:04 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not yet."

05:21:10 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Hmm. Ok."

05:21:12 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:21:12 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:21:13 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:21:22 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

05:21:26 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Probably 'cause of that storm. Another few -."

05:21:26 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Still not in range?"

05:21:27 Morris Corlew sighs.

05:21:30 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

05:21:36 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

05:22:00 Lily Kaise says, "I bet we're close though."

05:22:05 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:22:10 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:22:13 Morris Corlew nods. "Should be."

05:25:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

05:28:50 Vernos Bailey says, "I am kind of sad to have to hear the static of comms soon."

05:28:58 Morris Corlew grins.

05:29:02 Morris Corlew says, "Could turn your comm off."

05:29:05 Lily Kaise says, "Tell me about it. My ears always ring in comms."

05:29:15 You nod.

05:29:29 Lily Kaise says, "Not terribly but you can just hear this sort of very subtle whine."

05:29:49 Sarah Bellamy says, "Might wanna get that looked at. I've never heard of that before."

05:30:04 Lily Kaise says, "Naa i'm just sensitive to high frequencies."

05:30:09 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

05:30:09 Morris Corlew leans close to Sarah Bellamy and whispers something in her ear.
Vernos Bailey strolls south.

05:30:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:30:28 Sarah nods slowly at Morris and looks at her hands.

05:30:31 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

05:30:31 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 1103-7922 about 1.41 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northwest and Very Slightly Down and Remains of the unclaimed 138th about 1.42 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Southsouthwest and Very Slightly Up.
A riftstorm appears to be 16.29 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic South and Slightly Down.

05:30:35 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy on the cheek.

05:30:44 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew on the cheek.

05:30:52 Morris Corlew switches on a personal filing computer.

05:31:37 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

05:32:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I see an oort cloud."

05:32:08 Lily Kaise nods.

05:32:09 Morris Corlew nods.

05:32:12 You nod.

05:32:16 Vernos Bailey says, "We must be close."

05:34:36 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:34:44 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:34:51 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Beacon located."

05:34:53 Sarah says to Vernos, "Did you ever get your extra orange egg from thecoffee table?"

05:34:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:34:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:34:55 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:35:04 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

05:35:10 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ah nice. Which one, 286?"

05:35:26 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We have two. That's the one I took, though."

05:35:38 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "The other I'm guessin was 270?"

05:35:43 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah thought we'd probably end up by the bubble or oh 286 is by Orion."

05:35:43 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

05:35:47 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "It was Ather's face."

05:35:49 Morris Corlew nods.

05:35:52 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "285."

05:35:58 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Oh not bad."

05:35:59 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Aha."

05:36:10 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Nice!"

05:37:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:38:40 Vernos Bailey says, "No there are five there."

05:38:43 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

05:39:01 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

05:39:16 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:39:27 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:39:28 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

05:47:09 Vernos Bailey says, "I do not see a beacon on the sensors though."

05:47:25 Morris says to Vernos, "We've gotta be closer than this to see it."

05:47:34 Morris says to Vernos, "Rift sensors are different than the beacon's range."

05:47:39 Lily Kaise says, "You won't see a temporary beacon until you are very close onto it. Passives however, have a range of about 3 LTC."

05:47:48 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

05:48:06 Morris Corlew says, "Autotravel ain't based on rift sensors. If it were, we'd be in trouble."

05:48:07 Morris Corlew grins.

05:48:11 Lily Kaise chuckles.

05:48:28 You chuckle.

05:48:39 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

05:49:18 Morris Corlew says, "Well then."

05:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "O_, ,ver*body'{*ba!k!"

05:49:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "H/y everybody."

05:49:40 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:49:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "He==h[y."

05:49:43 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

05:49:43 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

05:49:44 [Tactical Communication] Tare Jacob Smitt transmits, "+eople, = t[ink t,e?crew i$ back."

05:49:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How did it go?"

05:49:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi."

05:50:47 Sarah Bellamy says, "Sorry, not itching to get back into comming with people, so I'm gonna wawit till we're closer."

05:50:51 Sarah Bellamy grins.

05:50:52 Lily Kaise says, "Heh."

05:50:53 Sarah Bellamy says, "Wait even."

05:50:55 You grin.

05:51:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:51:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Four mail messages."

05:51:26 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

05:51:40 Morris Corlew says, "I have much mail."

05:51:43 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bah, I already want to turn around."

05:51:43 Sarah says to Vernos, "Did you hear my question about your orange egg, because if you answered it I think I missed it."

05:51:48 Lily Kaise says, "Wow already up to 832 Command now."

05:51:58 Vernos Bailey says, "I asked it."

05:52:03 Vernos Bailey says, "Answered it I mean."

05:52:05 Morris Corlew says, "Our unity went up."

05:52:07 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

05:52:17 Sarah Bellamy blushes at Vernos Bailey.

05:52:20 Sarah Bellamy asks, "What did you say?"

05:52:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:52:22 Morris says to Vernos, "Looks like we've got a new member."

05:52:36 Vernos Bailey says, "I said I had two already."

05:52:39 Vernos Bailey smiles.

05:52:40 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh okay."

05:52:50 Sarah says to Vernos, "Sorry. My hair is clogging up my ears."

05:52:54 Sarah Bellamy grins.

05:53:03 Aisling the Fox idly keys her matte orange oxide metachannel FTL communicator for some reason.

05:53:13 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

05:53:15 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy softly on the ear.

05:53:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Having moose hair near you tends to lead to clogs."

05:53:22 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

05:53:22 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

05:53:24 Morris Corlew smirks at Vernos Bailey.

05:53:27 Sarah Bellamy hugs Morris Corlew.

05:54:16 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

05:54:26 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Make us go faster, Ather. Unleash the bolt."

05:54:47 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I actually had to check to make sure the microphone was not turned on."

05:54:54 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I just suggested the same to Pierre."

05:55:10 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Even dumb Ather has bright idea every now and then."

05:55:45 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well yes, but dumb Ather probably considered something that dummer Aisling probably didn't consider; if we create a strange storm, we could end up even farther off the beacon!"

05:56:00 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "I considered it."

05:56:11 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I voiced it. Victory is mine."

05:56:21 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Capitulate!"

05:56:25 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "No."

05:56:34 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "What does that mean?"

05:57:04 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Capitulate? It means surrender, in other words."

05:57:06 Nissi Valdaire says, "So many comm notices."

05:57:21 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

05:57:29 Morris says to Nissi, "So what's the plan?"

05:58:19 Rogue Romano says, "I finally finished mine."

05:58:33 Rogue Romano says, "I got four mail messages."

05:58:43 Rogue Romano says, "All insurance, I'm sure."

05:58:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Sae."

05:58:45 Morris Corlew says, "Insurance for sure."

05:58:46 Morris Corlew nods.

05:58:48 Rogue Romano nods.

05:58:51  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

05:58:51 You are carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio in your right hand.
Vernos Bailey says, "Same."

05:58:59 You finish off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:59:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I am sure it is all insurance."

05:59:11 You give a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

05:59:12 Rogue Romano says, "I'll give my insurance bill to Vern."

05:59:15 Rogue Romano smirks.

05:59:18 You say, "I stopped paying for insurance."

05:59:18 Morris Corlew chuckles.

05:59:20 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh hell no."

05:59:20 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah perhaps."

05:59:26 Sarah Bellamy says, "I"ve got 4 mail messages and disgruntled belt people."

05:59:34 Morris Corlew says, "If we're goin back out, I might suspend mine."

05:59:41 Vernos Bailey says, "Same."

05:59:42 Morris Corlew says, "Pull my cruiser support too."

05:59:48 You say, "I just canceled all of mine."

05:59:55 Morris Corlew says, "Can't see the org payin for that if I ain't here to use it."

06:00:01 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Can I suspend mine when I've got just a basic policy?"

06:00:05 Lily Kaise says, "Well we're still supporting Shules and the Org cruisers but it's no big."

06:00:17 Morris says to Sarah, "Sure."

06:00:18 You say to Lily, "I have a cruiser?"

06:00:42 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

06:00:50 You grin.

06:00:52 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:00:59 You laugh.

06:01:16 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

06:01:22 Lily Kaise says, "Well then we're supporting two cruisers! I guess it's an imaginary friend's haha."

06:01:26 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:01:27 You laugh.

06:01:31 Sarah Bellamy grins.

06:01:48 You say, "The imaginary friend is probably better at flying the cruiser than me."

06:01:54 Lily Kaise says, "Naa."

06:01:59 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

06:02:03 Sarah Bellamy giggles at you.

06:02:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

06:02:13 You grin at Sarah Bellamy.

06:02:13 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Burn To Shine".

06:02:24 Lily Kaise whistles.

06:02:30 Lily Kaise says, "Speaking of combat."

06:02:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

06:03:14 Rogue Romano idly keys her purple metachannel FTL communicator for some reason.

06:03:40 Vernos Bailey idly keys his red metachannel FTL communicator for some reason.

06:03:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits an irritating burst of static.

06:03:55 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

06:04:40 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:04:55 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

06:05:13 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oorts oorts everywhere."

06:05:14 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

06:05:14 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 7931-9711 about 1.4 light-trade cycles toward Galactic North and Slightly Down and Opik-Oort Signature 1103-7922 about 15.25 light-grand cycles toward Galactic West and Very Slightly Down.
A riftstorm appears to be 1.4 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic South and Very Slightly Down.

06:05:20 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

06:06:35 Morris Corlew grins.

06:06:36 Eli scratches his head.

06:06:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Insurance."

06:06:45 Eli Grey says, "I'm sure a couple are insurance.."

06:07:10 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "EVA!!!!"

06:07:25 Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a news application.

06:07:31 Vernos Bailey flicks on a portable newsfeed aggregator and peers intently at the screen.

06:07:36 Keying his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, Morris Corlew chuckles.

06:07:43 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a news application.

06:07:43 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

06:07:45 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "We got a new orgmate?"

06:07:45 Vernos Bailey switches off a portable newsfeed aggregator.

06:07:57 Vernos Bailey says, "Looks like someone in the league beat up a drone."

06:08:06 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

06:08:11 Eli Grey returns his metallic silver touch einrophone to the main screen.

06:09:13 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah that takes a lot of talent!"

06:09:13 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, who could have possibly done that when Emily is clearly here with us."

06:09:14 Sarah Bellamy says, "That's just disturbing."

06:09:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Good morning. First of all, let me begin this report by welcoming Brent Farrell to the pilot corps. Then, I have the state of the corps report as of June 9th 2317 which tells us the following. 10 days into the term, the AEU has completed 16 out of a total of 131 total decoy beacon drops (12.21%). The AEU is also responsible for 0 out of 9 total destroyed rats nests (0.0% and finally the AEU is responsible for 0 out of 0 total salvage ops. Further I would like to add that at the moment 5 AEU pilots are out on an expedition, including our industrial whip, Space Defense Captain and Ground squad leader. I have no info on our progress towards goals, but if you need any help at all, with space or ground combat or general questions, feel free to ask me or write me a letter and I will do my best to give you a hand. That concludes my report for today. Have a nice day, and fly safe. Kim Saunders. [09:11 10 June 2317 GST]

06:10:37 Morris Corlew looks at Damien Goss thoughtfully.

06:10:48 Damien Goss says, "Kerry has applied to be in my org."

06:10:49 Sarah says to Damien, "You mad about the drone too, or something else?"

06:10:52 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

06:10:56 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh hell."

06:11:04 Eli Grey says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "What are these voices I keep hearing?"

06:11:05 Sarah Bellamy says, "That might be more disturbin than the drone."

06:11:07 Nissi Valdaire grins.

06:11:15 Nissi Valdaire says, "Easy choice there."

06:11:29 Eli Grey says, "I keep hearing all these voices coming out of this little thing that i'm wearing for some reason."

06:11:33 Eli Grey points at a metachannel FTL communicator.

06:11:35 Damien Goss says, "Indeed, I've heard way too many Kerry stories."

06:11:36 Morris Corlew grins at Eli Grey.

06:11:41 You chuckle at Eli Grey.

06:11:41 Sarah Bellamy chuckles at Eli Grey.

06:11:42 Morris Corlew says, "I've only heard one."

06:11:48 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

06:11:49 Lily Kaise glides south.

06:11:55 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

06:12:05 Damien Goss says, "I just hate writing rejection letters."

06:12:09 Eli Grey says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh,  that's right. It's all the peeps!"

06:12:15 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Maybe this'll be clearer now. Who's our new orgmate?"

06:12:21 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Or not."

06:12:38 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "I know."

06:14:36 Damien Goss says, "There are three people guaranteed not to get into my org."

06:15:03 Lily Kaise says, "One reason SEAS is by Invitation only."

06:15:06 Eli Grey says, "Just gotta ask, what's wrong with this person? I like to know these things before it's too late."

06:15:09 Eli Grey grins.

06:15:20 You grin at Lily Kaise.

06:15:22 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

06:15:26 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "They ate his pizza from the fridge."

06:15:32 Damien Goss says, "He just seems to be somewhat careless."

06:15:33 You say to Lily, "Can I join SEAS?"

06:15:38 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

06:15:38 Eli Grey gasps.

06:15:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Chances are if they don't want to join us, we don't want them either!"

06:15:42 Eli Grey grins at Anfisa the Wanderer.

06:15:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:15:56 You chuckle.

06:16:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

06:16:03 Morris says to Eli, "He uh...least from my conversation with him last year, didn't see the seriousness in what happened several years ago when he decided to launch the escape pod and almost left an irreplaceable unmanned ship floatin in space."

06:16:18 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow he still doesn't get that?"

06:16:43 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Is okay, he just wanted to go home and bring all of his friends with him."

06:16:48 Morris says to Lily, "He seemed to when folks were confrontin him a few weeks ago, but when I talked to him briefly about it last fall, he shrugged it off. I guess 'cause I didn't confront him about it."

06:16:55 Lily Kaise nods.

06:16:55 Eli Grey says, "An irreplacable ship? That sounds extra bad."

06:17:04 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Future Crimes."

06:17:12 Morris Corlew nods. "Nissi's combat support carrier."

06:17:17 Eli Grey says, "Oh.. that name Actually sounds familiar."

06:17:19 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Anfisa the Wanderer and nods.

06:17:23 Eli Grey says, "Oh! Right.. Damn."

06:17:27 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah one of a kind."

06:17:31 Morris Corlew nods.

06:17:41 Damien Goss says, "Not exactly."

06:17:43 Eli Grey says, "I remember when se got that heh."

06:17:52 Morris Corlew says, "He said to me at the time, last year, he didn't see what the big deal was, the ship was saved 'cause folks were in another ship in the bay."

06:17:52 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Is still mass produced ship."

06:17:56 Eli Grey says, "I sure wish they'd open that program back up."

06:17:57 Morris Corlew says, "Didn't seem to get the point."

06:17:58 Lily says to Eli, "Nissi's Combat Carrier or I suppose that's how it's classified?"

06:18:00 Damien Goss says, "Just not available for a replacement. I'm sure the EAOS have lots of them."

06:18:05 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

06:18:09 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Just excessively difficult to find another."

06:18:13 Lily Kaise nods.

06:18:13 Damien Goss nods to Anfisa the Wanderer.

06:18:15 Eli Grey nods to Anfisa the Wanderer.

06:18:49 You nod.

06:18:54 Nissi Valdaire says, "It had some refitting done."

06:19:02 Damien Goss asks, "Oh?"

06:19:22 Eli Grey says, "I was the secondary for the AEU pilot for that EAOS program, but it got shutdown before that happened."

06:19:26 Eli Grey shrugs.

06:19:41 Eli Grey says, "There was a good reason at the time, I just don't remember what it was."

06:19:49 Damien says to Nissi, "So excessively difficult to replace?"

06:20:31 Nissi Valdaire nods.

06:22:58 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:23:08 Morris Corlew says, "Woo."

06:23:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Oort."

06:23:13 Morris Corlew says, "Roids."

06:23:25 Eli Grey exclaims, "Quick! Probe that asteroid field!"

06:23:30 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oorts oorts everywhere, roids roids in my hair."

06:23:33 Morris Corlew grins. "That's 285."

06:23:42 Aisling the Fox says, "You are 285."

06:23:44 Damien Goss says, "I guess it's my fault. I really should have taken off recruiting before I left, like I meant to do. I just idn't think about it. Five is about all I want in my org at the moment."

06:23:57 Morris runs his fingers through Sarah's hair as if looking for something. "Hmm. I don't see none."

06:24:01 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

06:24:04 Sarah Bellamy grins at Aisling the Fox.

06:24:08 Eli Grey says, "285 300, it's all probable."

06:24:13 Eli Grey says, "Er probe-able."

06:24:15 Eli Grey laughs.

06:24:18 Sarah says to Morris, "Is because I ate them."

06:24:21 Eli Grey asks, "Probe adjacent?"

06:24:22 Lily Kaise says, "Yup that's the cluster."

06:24:26 "Like the spiders?" Morris Corlew looks at Sarah Bellamy thoughtfully.

06:24:28 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

06:24:28 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 7931-9711 about 23.07 light-grand cycles toward Galactic North and Down, Opik-Oort Signature 1103-7922 about 15.39 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southwest and Very Slightly Down, and Asteroid Cluster 9414-2462 about 1.37 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.
A riftstorm appears to be 1.98 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic South and Very Slightly Down.

06:24:39 Sarah Bellamy says, "No. I ate crunchy things in my hair, not webbing out of my butt."

06:24:45 Morris Corlew laughs.

06:24:45 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

06:24:47 Morris Corlew says, "Eww."

06:24:53 Morris Corlew says, "That almost sounds worse."

06:24:59 Sarah Bellamy laughs. "It kinda does."

06:25:02 Damien Goss says, "I'm just going to slide over into this corner a bit farther."

06:25:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow... that's just a lil too much information right there!"

06:25:03 Vernos Bailey says, "Um."

06:25:06 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:25:07 Sarah Bellamy says, "I ate nothin but pizza and ice cream."

06:25:13 You nod to Lily Kaise.

06:25:15 Morris Corlew grins at Damien Goss.

06:25:21 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

06:25:21 Morris says to Damien, "I don't blame ya at the moment."

06:25:23 Morris Corlew chuckles.

06:25:24 Eli Grey frowns at a room temperature cup of beef stew.

06:25:26 Eli Grey takes a few more spoonfuls of a room temperature cup of beef stew.

06:25:29 Eli Grey takes a few more spoonfuls of a room temperature cup of beef stew.

06:25:30 Vernos Bailey asks, "So whats the plan for the next trip?"

06:25:33 Eli Grey abandons his spoon and slurps down the last of a room temperature cup of beef stew, draining the cup.

06:25:37 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

06:25:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

06:26:06 Eli Grey says, "From what I know, the ship will be in dock for a day or two while things get sorted and Nissi makes sure that there's not anything else that requires her attention, then heading back out."

06:26:12 Damien Goss says, "We are going to drop everyone off that has said more than two thousand words and then run away again."

06:26:15 Damien Goss grins at Vernos Bailey.

06:26:26 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

06:26:27 Morris Corlew says, "I'm in trouble."

06:26:28 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

06:26:32 Damien Goss says, "Which pretty much means all of us."

06:26:37 Eli Grey says, "I think that aisling's ship comes first, if that's had any news on it."

06:26:40 Damien Goss nods to Eli Grey.

06:26:42 Morris Corlew chuckles.

06:26:43 Eli Grey says, "That's the impression I got anyways."

06:26:47 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ah ok that's good as I do need to sleep like about an hour and a half ago but hey it's fun to stay up and party!"

06:26:54 Lily Kaise grins.

06:27:00 You grin.

06:27:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

06:27:04 Aisling the Fox says, "We shall see."

06:27:13 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I'll be a zomby at work."

06:27:18 Aisling the Fox says, "I do have mails. And notification from Liaison Dad."

06:27:23 Damien Goss gives Aisling the Fox a thumbs up!

06:27:27 Morris Corlew asks, "Liaison dad?"

06:27:31 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes."

06:27:36 Aisling the Fox says, "Liaison Dad."

06:27:48 Aisling the Fox says, "He calls me most favorite son, and I call him Liaison Dad."

06:27:51 Eli Grey says, "Is everyone going? I'm still pretty sure I'm going but yeah."

06:27:54 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

06:27:55 Morris Corlew nods.

06:27:57 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:28:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I know we're in."

06:28:07 Sarah Bellamy says, "I"m going."

06:28:15 Morris Corlew says, "Me too."

06:28:17 Eli says to Aisling, "I know you've probably already got enough crew for your journey, but I'd be glad to help if you need anyone else."

06:28:23 Lily Kaise says, "Sure glad I don't have a liaison post nowadays."

06:28:28 Aisling the Fox nods to Eli Grey.

06:28:50 Damien Goss says, "I try to take every opportunity given to go out there. You never know when we'll meet someone new."

06:29:29 Aisling the Fox says, "I have fifteen spots that can be filled. I have not worked out everyone yet. There are of course several that are invited without exception whether they know or not yet."

06:30:26 Aisling the Fox says, "Anfisa, Pierre, Cheri, Nissi, Melinda, and Ather."

06:30:56 Sarah says to Aisling, "When is this taking place and would you consider me for a spot?"

06:31:11 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "I do not know, and I do not know!"

06:31:15 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

06:31:17 Sarah Bellamy exclaims, "Fair enough!"

06:31:23 Aisling the Fox says, "Cats will probably be next on list to be opened to."

06:31:26 Sarah Bellamy says, "Okay."

06:32:08 Aisling says to Eli, "You will have to tread very carefully if you do go. Same with Ather."

06:32:14 Vernos Bailey says, "I would not mind an invite but if it fills up before then, then I would completely understand."

06:32:34 Eli says to Aisling, "If you get bad news about the parts, I would certainly consider giving fienstein a shot. Surely he can find at least some way to help."

06:32:43 Aisling the Fox says, "We are literally aiding unregistered people."

06:32:46 Eli says to Aisling, "Oh? Why us specifically?"

06:32:48 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

06:32:49 Eli Grey nods.

06:33:12 Damien Goss says, "Oh yeah, that whole AEU restriction from up above."

06:33:19 Damien Goss says, "I almost forgot about that."

06:33:37 Eli Grey says, "I'l have to get clarification on what that means. Because I thought it just meant trade. And I'm not offering to trade anything, just help some folks who desparetly need it."

06:33:49 Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.

06:33:51 Morris says to Eli, "Kim tried. Might talk to her."

06:33:55 Eli Grey says, "But yes, something to be careful about it."

06:34:11 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah definitely no drading."

06:34:13 Eli says to Morris, "Oh she tried and reprimanded for it?"

06:34:24 Morris says to Eli, "I don't know the details."

06:34:35 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, just have to hope nobody finds out about that little trip to Andy's."

06:34:38 Morris says to Eli, "But...she's Voice anyhow, so I'd definitely talk to her for clarification."

06:34:44 Eli whistles innocently.

06:34:55 Morris says to Eli, "That hasn't been an issue before."

06:35:41 Aisling the Fox says, "This might be slightly different. Andy's is known faction at least."

06:35:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

06:35:47 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:35:47 Morris Corlew nods.

06:35:47 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 887,805.95 credits.

06:35:48 Eli Grey says, "Oh.. hmm."

06:35:53 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

06:35:57 Morris Corlew says, "Hey. Beacons."

06:36:02 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

06:36:02 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 7931-9711 about 17.76 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northnortheast, Opik-Oort Signature 1103-7922 about 20.86 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsouthwest, and Asteroid Cluster 9414-2462 about 1.06 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.

06:36:18 Vernos says to Aisling, "I would still like to be considered while we try to seek clarification."

06:36:23 You exclaim, "A known beacon!"

06:36:31 Eli Grey says, "Yeah. And I was really just trading stuff I made, not realy alliance tech or anything."

06:36:43 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

06:36:52 Sarah Bellamy exclaims, "I see you temp beacon!"

06:36:53 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

06:37:15 Damien Goss says, "I'll be back."

06:37:18 Damien Goss steps south.

06:37:45 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

06:38:22 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

06:38:28 Vernos Bailey says, "I will have to get a hoverpallet to get that aquarium off the ship."

06:38:30 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

06:41:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

06:41:52 Eli Grey says, "Well looks like this so called road trip is coming to an end. I'ts too bad that we didn't do anyting useful for anyone anywhere at all."

06:42:23 Sarah Bellamy says, "I didn't know we were supposed to."

06:42:29 Eli Grey grins at Sarah Bellamy.

06:42:36 Eli says to Sarah, "I was being sarcastic, because of Best."

06:42:36 Morris says to Sarah, "We're always supposed to help folks out if we can."

06:42:43 Morris says to Eli, "Oh."

06:42:44 Sarah Bellamy giggles at Eli Grey.

06:43:00 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I'm totaly kidding, we did tons of useful stuff."

06:43:06 "I know that." Sarah Bellamy nods to Morris Corlew. "I just meant I didn't know that was the goal of this particular outing."

06:43:15 Morris Corlew nods.

06:43:17 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

06:43:32 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

06:43:58 Sarah says to Vernos, "I had a blast."

06:43:58 Eli Grey grins at Vernos Bailey.

06:43:59 You grin. "It was fun."

06:44:03 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew on the nose.

06:44:07 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah sure has been."

06:44:14 Morris pretends to sneeze.

06:44:17 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

06:44:28 Morris Corlew sniffles.

06:44:43 Vernos Bailey says, "Going to buy an album or something and store photos in it."

06:44:45 Morris rubs his nose.

06:44:50 Sarah Bellamy says, "I have to question this response after weeks of observing it."

06:44:56 Vernos Bailey says, "Whatever nissi decides to send me."

06:45:02 Morris says to Sarah, "What's that?"

06:45:10 Morris pretends to dig in his ear.

06:45:14 Sarah says to Morris, "I sneeze when you kiss my nose because your beard tickles me. But I have no beard."

06:45:36 Morris says to Sarah, "My beard's below my lip. Not above it."

06:45:40 Morris Corlew grins at Sarah Bellamy.

06:45:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

06:45:48 Sarah Bellamy gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

06:46:05 Sarah Bellamy says, "Mustache then."

06:46:06 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

06:46:08 Damien Goss sits down.

06:46:12 Sarah Bellamy waves to Damien Goss.

06:46:43 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

06:46:48 Vernos Bailey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

06:46:48 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

06:46:54 Sarah Bellamy says, "Then I'd really sneeze."

06:46:58 Morris Corlew chuckles.

06:46:58 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

06:46:59 Eli Grey says, "I think all I need to grab is my bots and my workbench."

06:47:05 Vernos Bailey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

06:47:20 Vernos Bailey says, "I will have to get a pallet for the aquarium."

06:47:38 Morris says to Vernos, "The supply shop has 'em. Southeast of the landin pad."

Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight.

07:01:50 Rogue Romano slinks south.

07:01:51 You grin at Lily Kaise.

07:01:55 You say to Lily Kaise, "No problem."

07:01:56 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Sounds a bit...physiologically impossible."

07:02:01 Eli says to Aisling, "You and Ather's banter has been quite entertaining."

07:02:08 Sarah Bellamy picks up a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

07:02:13 Sarah Bellamy puts a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow in a black backpack.

07:02:30 Aisling the Fox says, "You will have to ask him how he got nickname Arseface."

07:02:32 Eli says to Aisling, "I actually thought you guys genuinely hated each other when I first got back around."

07:02:39 Aisling the Fox laughs.

07:02:42 Sarah Bellamy grins.

07:02:44 Eli Grey says, "Just from the conversations on comms."

07:03:16 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And don't forget your junk. If you're not Lily, you can probably have it all collected in under 5 minutes!"

07:03:19 Sarah Bellamy says, "I was never really certain."

07:03:22 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

07:03:22 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki follows behind Rogue Romano on a dark purple jeweled leash.

07:03:22 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rather than 5 hours."

07:03:26 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

07:05:15 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh, not missions, beacons."

07:05:16 Sarah Bellamy says, "I didn't know that was possible."

07:05:17 Nissi Valdaire grins.

07:05:23 Sarah Bellamy says, "Ah."

07:05:24 Morris Corlew says, "Wonder why the BAS has a League core."

07:06:43 Vernos Bailey says into his red metachannel FTL communicator, "I think I would like to try flying draconis again."

07:06:46 Sarah Bellamy smiles at Lily Kaise. "Thank you for the extra eggs."

07:06:48 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm probably because Evenia didn't have an available AEU one."

07:07:45 Morris says to Lily, "Thought Mel had 'em on Joy Ride all ready to go though. So who knows."

07:07:48 Melinda Michaels yawns.

07:07:50 Lily Kaise says, "Ah ok I figured you'd probably just delete them if needed but thanks."

07:07:58 Eli says to Melinda, "Ready to sleep in a real bed?"

07:08:13 Melinda says to Eli, "Probably, after being awake awhile."

07:08:25 Eli Grey says, "I'm all about being out here finding things, but I'd be lieing if I said I wasn't a little excited about sleeping in my own bed."

07:08:32 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:08:40 Sarah Bellamy says, "I have to confess to agreeing with that just a bit."

07:08:42 Rogue Romano says, "I do miss my bed."

07:08:46 Damien Goss says, "I've slept in worse than the bunks."

07:08:52 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

07:09:39 Aisling the Fox sits down on Jason Rat's lap.

07:09:46 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

07:09:46 Sarah Bellamy nods to Morris Corlew. "You sure do."

07:10:18 Morris Corlew stretches.

07:10:22 Vernos Bailey says, "I will be mildly curious how the alliance rewards us for the research gathered on this trip."

07:10:34 Sarah Bellamy says, "Me too."

07:10:35 Eli says to Lily, "Ooh, I just thought of a great idea for you."

07:10:36 Vernos Bailey says, "All of the alliances really."

07:10:36 Morris Corlew says, "I'll probably be capped again."

07:11:23 Sarah says to Melinda, "Guilty as charged."

07:11:39 Eli says to Lily, "If you can come up with forty different combinations of pizza, you already have a Pizza Place name ready to go."

07:11:50 Sarah Bellamy chuckles.

07:11:56 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

07:12:03 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I've been so happy not to have a cap on anything for several months. I'll probably hold off onturning in planets for awhile though."

07:12:23 Lily Kaise laughs at Eli Grey.

07:12:28 Cheri Lindbergh says into the PA microphone, "Pierre, don't forget your contraption."

07:12:30 Morris Corlew says, "Kinda might as well. Help the org out."

07:12:34 You grin at Lily Kaise.

07:12:41 Eli Grey exclaims, "Just call Lily Kaise's Forty Pizzas! We got every pizzza you could possibly want!"

07:12:42 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

07:12:47 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Huh not sure I even like 40 different ones but be careful what you wish for!"

07:12:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Well, I will end up capped again, probably. So the question is, do I cap me or let Nissi do it with al that stuff she will turn in."

07:12:51 Melinda Michaels grins.

07:12:59 Lily Kaise grins at Melinda Michaels.

07:13:01 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:13:46 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

07:13:51 Lily Kaise says, "Exploration is easy to cap."

07:13:53 Aisling the Fox says, "Cap all the exploration."

07:14:15 Rogue Romano says, "May be for you."

07:14:35 Aisling the Fox says, "Probably harder for Lily actually."

07:14:43 Lily says to Rogue, "You'll probably end up with enough to cap from this trip."

07:14:47 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:14:48 Rogue Romano says, "But seriously, I not seen cap since I been a pilot."

07:14:48 You grin.

07:14:57 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

07:14:57 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 7931-9711 about 24.58 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsoutheast and Slightly Down, Asteroid Cluster 7728-1002 about 1.38 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northnortheast and Slightly Up, Asteroid Cluster 9414-2462 about 13.69 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Up and Slightly Southwest, Opik-Oort Signature 5730-2387 about 1.06 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Slightly Down, and Opik-Oort Signature 4636-6516 about 1.41 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.

A temporary beacon appears to be 1.99 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Down.

07:15:21 Aisling the Fox says, "My exploration was capped for many cycles. Might get capped again with this. We will see."

07:15:30 Melinda Michaels nods. "We will."

07:15:32 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with her back feet, then eats it.

07:15:33 You nod to Aisling the Fox.

07:15:46 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

07:15:48 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yum."

07:15:55 Melinda Michaels says, "That's nasty."

07:15:57 Sarah Bellamy snickers.

07:15:58 Cheri says to a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki, "Delicious, wasn't it."

07:16:05 Melinda Michaels grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

07:16:08 Rogue Romano grins.

07:16:11 Eli Grey says, "It still feels weird actually needing more exploration points."

07:16:18 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know why people think that is gross."

07:16:20 Aisling the Fox strokes a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's bristly hair.

07:16:30 Sarah Bellamy says, "I don't think it is necessarily."

07:16:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:16:33 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

07:16:36 Eli Grey says, "I was pretty far past anything with requirements when I left, now I'm way behind."

07:16:37 Rogue says to a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki, "Say "Yes yes Cheri, it sure was.""

07:16:45 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

07:16:46 Rogue Romano strokes a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's bristly hair.

07:16:50 Aisling the Fox says, "It is."

07:16:52 Morris Corlew asks, "I do. If I sat here and ate stuff that came outta my orafices?"

07:16:59 Eli says to Sarah, "What di dyou call it earlier? Butt webbing?"

07:17:08 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Finall approach, stand by!"

07:17:13 Eli Grey says, "Nice big bowl of butt webbing."

07:17:17 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

07:17:23 Aisling the Fox says, "Spiders do this. Many insects shed exoskeleton and eat it. So do lizards and snakes."

07:17:29 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:17:29 Damien Goss nods.
Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "You heard him, stand people."

07:17:33 Morris Corlew says, "Yes, don't make it not gross though."

07:17:43 Sarah Bellamy says, "NOt gross for them."

07:17:45 Eli says to Aisling, "I believe that.. but webbing's not really the same as exoskeleton."

07:17:46 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

07:17:47 Sarah Bellamy says, "They're spiders."

07:17:51 Sarah Bellamy says, "They think we're gross too."

07:17:53 Eli Grey says, "Exoskeleton has to come off no matter what."

07:17:53 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

07:17:53 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 7931-9711 about 1.04 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Southsoutheast and Slightly Down, Asteroid Cluster 7728-1002 about 1.34 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northnortheast and Slightly Up, Asteroid Cluster 9414-2462 about 14.38 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Up and Slightly Southsouthwest, Opik-Oort Signature 5730-2387 about 25.08 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Slightly Down, and Opik-Oort Signature 4636-6516 about 1.34 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.

07:17:57 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:18:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:18:07 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

07:18:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:18:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:18:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:18:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:18:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Morris Corlew says, "I could sit here and eat my fingernails or my hair. Y'all'd probably kick me off the ship."

07:18:49 Eli says to Aisling, "It's roughly the same. But the exoskeleton would have to come off anywyas. The spider is making the webbing without really needing to."

07:18:53 Cheri Lindbergh snorts.

07:18:58 Melinda Michaels stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

07:18:59 Damien Goss steps south.

07:19:00 Lily Kaise

07:19:00 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light purple shipsuit with purple trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of soft light purple slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Ast
07:19:00 eria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

07:19:02 You're already standing.

07:19:02 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

07:19:04 Eli says to Aisling, "But I suppose that's really just semantics."

07:20:34 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'

Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

07:21:10 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

07:21:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

07:21:13 You grin.

07:21:14 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

07:21:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "The Best Way To Travel, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

07:21:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

07:21:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

07:21:31 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

07:21:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:21:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

07:21:35 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:21:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:21:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:21:38 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:21:43 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

07:21:46 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, The Best Way To Travel! Welcome to home space!"

07:21:47 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

07:21:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

07:21:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:22:04 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins wiggles his hairy palps endearingly.

07:22:07 The ship's current engine speed is 6857 km/s.

07:22:18 The computer reports that the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" has landed on the planet New Earth.

07:22:26 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 674,969.69 credits.

07:22:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:22:27 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

07:22:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, The Best Way To Travel. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

07:22:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

07:22:34 Lily Kaise says, "Going to go turn off points contributions and then go to bed."

07:22:38 You say, "Ok, me too."

07:22:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

07:22:46 Lily Kaise says, "Oh will put the aquariums down too."

07:22:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

07:22:49 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

07:22:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

07:22:50 You nod.

07:26:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

14:12:21 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

22:41:05 Constantine Stone says, "I looked at some pictures Vernos had."

22:41:09 Lily Kaise says, "We may be going out again in a day or so."

22:41:11 Constantine Stone exclaims, "It looked like you guys found a lot of cool planets!"

22:41:13 Ather Jammoa just arrived.

22:41:13 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh really?"

22:41:14 You grin at Constantine Stone.

22:41:19 Lily Kaise nods to Constantine Stone.

22:41:21 I don't understand that.

22:41:24 You wave to Ather Jammoa.

22:41:24 Lily Kaise waves to Ather Jammoa.

22:41:27 Constantine Stone waves.

22:41:29 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Mischiefmaker Unchained" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:41:31 Ather Jammoa says to Constantine, "You been keeping up with your flying and stuff OK?"

22:41:31 Constantine Stone says, "Hey Ather."

22:41:38 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Yeah!"

22:41:47 Constantine Stone says, "I've done a bunch of standards and a high in my fighter."

22:41:47 Ather Jammoa says to Constantine, "Any questions, concerns, etc?"

22:42:15 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm."

22:42:16 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:42:30 Ather Jammoa says to Constantine, "We can discuss them in a more private setting if you're hesitant to ask them around others."

22:42:40 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, it's okay."

22:42:54 Constantine Stone says, "I'm still using the cadet fighter, but I qualify for the heavy fighter also."

22:42:58 Constantine Stone says, "And I'm getting close to the bastille."

22:43:04 Ather Jammoa says, "Well."

22:43:06 Lily Kaise says, "Oh you'll love both of those."

22:43:08 Constantine Stone asks, "Neither of those have FTL drives, right?"

22:43:09 Ather Jammoa says, "Just remember, the latter two don't have FTL drives."

22:43:12 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

22:43:13 Lily Kaise nods.

22:43:17 You nod.

22:43:20 Constantine Stone says, "So that's a little less convenient, though."

22:43:23 Constantine Stone says, "For a dedicated beacon ship."

22:43:26 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe that's not so bad."

22:43:30 Lily Kaise says, "Well just keep them on the Torus."

22:43:34 Constantine Stone nods.

22:43:41 Ather Jammoa says, "To be perfectly honest, I haven't found anything good about either of those fighters that I can't get in a standard fighter, if you like that sort of thing."

22:43:57 Ather Jammoa says, "Yes, one has a stronger hull, but that won't do shit for you if you can't take it places without a mothership."

22:43:59 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah and they draw meaner enemies too."

22:44:05 Constantine Stone says, "I did some double fighter beacons with Erik a while back."

22:44:10 Constantine Stone says, "And he was praising the grid on the bastille."

22:44:10 Ather Jammoa says, "And yes, one has more weapons, which will do even less when your grid is drained dry."

22:44:16 Lily Kaise nods.

22:44:22 You nod.

22:44:25 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

22:44:31 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, my grid runs out all the time."

22:44:40 Constantine Stone says, "And I have to dodge around waiting for it to come back."

22:44:46 Constantine Stone says, "But I'm getting close to the jackrabbit."

22:44:52 Ather says to Constantine, "Well, you don't yet qualify for better grids, but the point is, in a heavy fighter, your grid will run out even faster."

22:44:54 Lily says to Constantine, "Have you worked on obtaining your basic engineering tools?"

22:44:58 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

22:44:58 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

22:45:01 Constantine Stone says, "Right."

22:45:03 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:45:03 There are four headlines.

22:45:04 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I finally got those."

22:45:27 Lily Kaise says, "Ok as the energy dumps do help with the grid and of course the other tools are obvsiously useful."

22:45:35 Ather says to Constantine, "I would suggest sticking with the standard fighter. A lot of people have actually done that. Heck, Nissi still uses a standard fighter a lot for solo combat."

22:45:42 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

22:45:50 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I should build a couple energy dumps, I haven't done that yet."

22:46:00 Constantine says to Ather, "Ah, okay. I'll keep working in that then."

22:46:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, I mean, a fighter is worth less than shit in an attack if you can't jump it to places without the high risk of losing the fucking mothership."

22:46:17 Constantine Stone says, "This is true."

22:46:26 Constantine Stone asks, "What about the last battery listed in your book?"

22:46:27 Tare Jacob Smitt's group just arrived.

22:46:31 Constantine Stone asks, "Do you use that?"

22:46:32 Lily Kaise waves.

22:46:36 Tare Jacob Smitt orders a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

22:46:37 You wave.

22:46:37 Tare Jacob Smitt waves.

22:46:41 Ather Jammoa says, "There are a lot of people who are content to crew instead of fighting solo, and those people are...well, they are what they are."

22:46:42 Constantine Stone says, "It's got an instantaneous speed of 8000."

22:46:48 Tare Jacob Smitt orders a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

22:46:52 Constantine Stone says, "Hey guys."

22:46:56 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

22:47:00 Jacob says to Ather, "Good to see your face once again."

22:47:01 You exclaim, "Solo fighting is fun!"

22:47:03 You hear Ather Jammoa's black flip einrophone ringing.

22:47:07 Ather says to Constantine, "I would suggest, for now, sticking with the revo battery for combat."

22:47:09 You hear Ather Jammoa's black flip einrophone ringing.

22:47:11 Tare Jacob Smitt waves.

22:47:12 Ather Jammoa waves to Tare Jacob Smitt.

22:47:12 Constantine Stone nods.

22:47:14 Tare Jacob Smitt's group strolls out.

22:47:14 You hear Ather Jammoa's black flip einrophone ringing.

22:47:15 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the vostok-class capsule "Anka" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:47:16 Ather Jammoa removes a black flip einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

22:47:17 Ali Candan just arrived.

22:47:17 Ather Jammoa flips a black flip einrophone open.

22:47:18 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:47:19 Ather Jammoa asks, "Yep?"

22:47:21 You wave to Ali Candan.

22:47:24 Ali Candan waves to you.

22:47:26 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person Accord gemini "Mischiefmaker Unchained" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

22:47:35 Lily says to Constantine, "Anyway, I'll digress a little and tell you that we'd love to invite you to join Seas. After you have considered your options, just let us know or if you have any additional quesitons, jsut contact either Shule or me."

22:47:38 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:47:39 Ather Jammoa asks, "Oh, this is good news. Where?"

22:47:41 Ali Candan sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

22:47:46 Constantine Stone says, "Okay, I will."

22:47:55 Constantine Stone says, "I'm about to take a moderate break for about a week."

22:47:58 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

22:48:00 Constantine Stone says, "So I'll get back to you after that."

22:48:04 Lily Kaise says, "Sure thing."

22:48:06 You nod to Constantine Stone.

22:48:09 You grin.

22:48:24 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:48:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Let me know. I'll help cover it."

22:48:45 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:48:46 Ather Jammoa says, "Yep."

22:49:05 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:49:06 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Thanks!"

22:49:07 Constantine Stone finishes off a glass of fizzy cola.

22:49:12 Constantine Stone puts a glass in a shiny chrome trash bin.

22:49:15 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:49:15 Ather Jammoa says, "Let me know if you want to go to graves later. I might be available."

22:49:19 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We don't have any set requirements for contributions and such. Whatever you-constantine interesting outfit there too!"

22:49:27 Constantine Stone laughs.

22:49:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:49:32 You laugh.

22:49:38 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:49:38 Ather Jammoa says, "Ok."

22:49:39 Constantine Stone says, "Oh I was kind of lounging at the frontier late last night."

22:49:41 Constantine Stone says, "I forgot to change."

22:49:48 Lily Kaise says, "Oh been there."

22:49:53 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

22:49:53 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Catch you in a bit then!"

22:49:54 Ather Jammoa flips a black flip einrophone shut with a satisfying click.

22:49:54 Ather Jammoa places a black flip einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

22:50:04 Ali Candan says, "Flip flip."

22:50:08 You grin.

22:50:10 Ali Candan says, "And click."

22:50:18 Ather says to Ali, "Well, I don't understand the stupid people who use those dumb touch things."

22:50:19 Lily Kaise smiles.

22:50:24 Ather Jammoa says, "A keypad is where it's at."

22:50:32 Ali says to Ather, "You're too old man."

22:50:34 Lily Kaise says, "It's a necessary evil."

22:50:36 Constantine Stone laughs.

22:50:39 Ather Jammoa says, "Fuck that."

22:50:39 Lily Kaise shrugs.

22:50:48 Lily Kaise says, "I am not fond of electronic leashes."

22:50:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:50:58 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes that time they almost decided to lead an expedition.

22:51:49 Ali Candan chortles.

22:51:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway, I'm going to go catch up on paperwork, send comm notices and shit."

22:51:52 Ali Candan says, "Man. How times change."

22:51:58 Ali Candan gestures vaguely.

22:51:59 You wave to Ather Jammoa.

22:52:01 Ather says to Constantine, "Le tme know if you have additional questions."

22:52:01 Constantine says to Ather, "See you later!"

22:52:02 Lily Kaise waves to Ather Jammoa.

22:52:03 You say to Ather, "Later."

22:52:06 Constantine says to Ather, "Will do."

22:52:06 Ather Jammoa strides out.

22:52:28 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:52:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yea waiting on edge to see how those discoveries turn out."

22:52:39 You grin at Lily Kaise.

22:52:42 Lily Kaise grins.

22:52:47 Ali Candan asks, "I've heard 52 planetes?"

22:53:06 Ali Candan says, "You rich guys."

22:53:12 Lily Kaise says, "I'm not exactly sure but that sounds about right."

22:53:14 You say, "Yeah, it was aobut that many."

22:53:17 You say, "About."

22:53:25 Constantine Stone asks, "Do you think that we'll ever try to go land on any?"

22:53:28 Constantine Stone asks, "Do we ever do that?"

22:53:46 Lily Kaise says, "I don't plan to turn mine in as I think we're going to get slammed with likely caps just on the discoveries."

22:53:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:53:54 You laugh.

22:54:28 Ali Candan says, "I need all the monies."

22:54:30 Lily says to Constantine, "I'd like to take some folks out for a little exploration sometime this summer too."

22:54:42 Constantine says to Lily, "That would be awesome."

22:54:47 Lily Kaise smiles.

22:54:47 You smile at Lily Kaise.

22:54:58 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

22:54:59 Lily says to Constantine, "Glad you're interested!"

22:55:12 Constantine Stone says, "I've been trying to get my exploration up for a rift drive but it's incredibly slow going."

22:55:18 Lily Kaise says, "We can do some of the same probing we just did."

22:55:19 You say, "Yeah, it can be."

22:55:32 Ali says to Lily, "What's your exploration points at?"

22:55:41 You say, "It took forever to get my first 300 exploration points."

22:55:42 Lily Kaise says, "Right now about 7800."

22:55:47 Ali Candan says, "Good stuff."

22:55:49 Constantine Stone says, "Wow."

22:55:52 Lily Kaise says, "Most definitely."

22:56:01 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I sure want a lander!"

22:56:04 Ali Candan says, "I got my 300 exploration points in 3 or 4 days."

22:56:06 You grin at Lily Kaise.

22:56:08 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I think I've probably spent thirt or so hours getting to 133."

22:56:10 Constantine Stone asks, "Whoa, really?"

22:56:11 Lily Kaise grins at you.

22:56:46 Ali Candan says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "It's Evangeline."

22:56:47 Lily says to Constantine, "Have you done the exploration from Space vermin? There's not a lot but every bit helps."

22:56:53 Ali Candan says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "She was running around naked."

22:57:00 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, and they don't give me the jobs anymore, unfortunately."

22:57:00 Lily Kaise asks, "What who?"

22:57:08 You turn general communication on.

22:57:10 There appear to be about 23 pilots recently active.

22:57:10 The communicator network detects:

22:57:14 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ship, fuck's sake. There is no coffee."

22:57:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Eva."

22:57:18 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh well that's a good thing! You've graduated!"

22:57:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey."

22:57:23 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Yeah!"

22:57:24 Lily Kaise girns cromulently at Constantine Stone.

22:57:27 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Reality" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

22:57:31 Ali Candan says, "Time to do stuff."

22:57:32 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

22:57:32 Ali Candan strides out.

22:57:39 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the vostok-class capsule "Anka" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

22:57:51 Constantine Stone says, "I can still get the ground jobs from them, but I haven't done them in a while."

22:57:55 Lily Kaise asks, "So how about ground combat.. Do you like that type of work?"

22:57:58 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

22:57:59 Constantine Stone says, "I like doing nests with a crew better."

22:58:02 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I love it."

22:58:04 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Reality" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:58:12 You grin at Constantine Stone.

22:58:16 Constantine Stone says, "I got a fort to lead my own nests, but I was getting too excited."

22:58:18 Lily Kaise says, "Ah good then need to get you to GMG someime."

22:58:20 Mark Washington just arrived.

22:58:22 Constantine Stone says, "And didn't realize I needed a ton of other stuff."

22:58:28 Constantine Stone says, "So maybe someday."

22:58:33 You say to Constantine, "How many ground combat points do you have?"

22:58:33 Constantine Stone says, "Oh that would be awesome."

22:58:42 You wave to Mark Washington.

22:58:44 Constantine Stone says, "349.9."

22:58:45 Constantine Stone smiles.

22:58:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "How are you?"

22:58:49 Mark Washington nods.

22:58:52 Mark Washington orders a curiously shaped bottle of water.

22:58:59 Mark Washington takes a sip of a curiously shaped bottle of water.

22:59:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Great. How are you?"

22:59:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm all right."

22:59:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "A bit sleepy, but otherwise fine."

22:59:35 Constantine Stone says, "I picked up an EAOS suit for my second slot so that clearing the vents would be easier."

22:59:40 Constantine Stone says, "Because it seems like plasma is hard to come by."

22:59:58 Mark Washington quickly drains a curiously shaped bottle of water.

22:59:59 Constantine Stone says, "So once I get a league suit maybe I'll try to start leading my own nests."

23:00:03 Mark Washington puts a bottle in a shiny chrome trash bin.

23:00:07 Mark Washington ambles out.

23:00:15 You say, "It's not that hard usually, but not everyone wants to help clear old Frontier. Unfortunately."

23:00:33 Constantine Stone says, "Well, it might just be rare among the people who were here."

23:00:37 "But definitely, leading nests is fun!" You grin at Constantine Stone.

23:00:41 Constantine Stone says, "Actually a lot of people were really nice about helping me clear it."

23:00:48 Constantine Stone says, "But none of them had plasma."

23:00:48 You say, "Awesome."

23:00:49 Constantine Stone laughs.

23:01:00 You say, "Oh."

23:01:04 You say, "That is a problem."

23:01:18 Constantine Stone says, "I still have yet to do a megapod."

23:01:21 Constantine Stone says, "I would like to try that."

23:01:29 You say, "They're fun too."

23:01:34 Constantine Stone says, "And yeah, my short term goal has been to push hard for a rift drive so I could check out GMG."

23:01:42 You grin.

23:01:46 Constantine Stone says, "But I just recently hit 1500 industry and I don't know if I can go this hard all the time."

23:01:49 Constantine Stone says, "3000 is a long way away."

23:01:53 You say, "Yeah."

23:02:09 You say, "Well, once you get 300 exploration. You can still go to GMG."

23:02:13 Constantine Stone nods.

23:02:19 You say, "Actually, I went before I had 300 exploration."

23:02:30 Constantine Stone says, "Today I got the second best engine, so I think that will help me get those artifacts faster."

23:02:36 You grin.

23:02:50 Constantine Stone says, "I had been putting it off for a while because I was so slow."

23:03:01 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Tesla?"

23:03:03 You nod. "I know the feeling."

23:03:23 Constantine Stone says, "And from reading the news and such."

23:03:33 Constantine Stone says, "It sounds like the AEU hasn't led an expedition in quite some time."

23:03:45 Constantine Stone says, "So I think a long-term goal for me is to try to do that at some point."

23:03:52 Lily Kaise nods.

23:03:53 You nod and smile.

23:03:54 Constantine Stone says, "And definitely help out on any AEU-led one."

23:04:22 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Say an archaeological site."

23:04:30 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Reality" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

23:04:31 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Oh oh!"

23:04:32 Lily Kaise says, "Did you get our Exploration scout? I would highly recommend that as the shp to artifact in because it is pretty fast for it's level."

23:04:41 You say, "Yeah, it's really great."

23:04:41 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, it's great."

23:04:46 Lily Kaise says, "Good."

23:04:55 Constantine Stone says, "I've been using that for a lot of things, since I give it my best upgrades."

23:04:58 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

23:04:59 Constantine Stone says, "I even take cadets shooting in it."

23:05:00 Constantine Stone smiles.

23:05:03 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

23:05:19 You say, "Heh, the combat scout is better for that."

23:05:19 Lily Kaise says, "The other people tend to get the gemini but it's not really designed for exploration but it can carry battlesuits."

23:05:23 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I never thought I would see the day where just 2 people out of 23 would want an archaeological site."

23:05:30 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I only just recently qualified for that."

23:05:44 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah the combat scout is awesome and we do have a Bolt Thrower in the org too."

23:05:45 Constantine Stone asks, "Right, is the gemini what you take to GMG?"

23:05:46 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

23:05:52 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

23:05:56 You nod.

23:05:57 You glance at your communicator's screen.

23:05:57 Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots: as of this comm notice, all AEU sectors are clear of all threats. I'm also glad to see that there were minimal losses in the AEU fleet while we were out on the most recent expedition. Notably, a cargo hauler by the name of "Fire comet". I say to that pilot as well as others, if you need any help in flying, or have any questions about space combat in general, feel free to call the SDC office, or send a letter to Ather, and I will do my best to help you out. Finally, I know I promised that I would hold space combat classes which would give additional information about the threats that we tend to face, but the recent expeditions, plus a couple of other things have kept me from doing it. In the meantime, if anyone has any questions about how to fight off anything like pirates, IFS, Outsiders, thralls etc, feel free to contact me and I'll do my best to answer them. You will receive a comm notice when I have figured out a schedule for space combat classes, and there will also be a board post. [21:05 22 June 2317 GST]

23:05:58 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

23:06:11 Constantine Stone asks, "What about the Emerging Tech upgrade to the exploration scout?"

23:06:19 Constantine Stone says, "Ather's book says it reduces battery life, so I haven't done it."

23:06:41 You say, "To make it an advanced scout? Nah, it's not worth it in my opinion."

23:06:47 Constantine Stone asks, "I guess if you have enough points for the combat scout, what is the point?"

23:06:48 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Thought so fuck."

23:06:49 Lily Kaise says, "When it became available, I tried it and I revertedit."

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:09:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:09:56 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Xavier the old sleeping big silver soldier felo here.

23:58:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:59:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot,
23:59:00  a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Xavier the old big silver soldier felo here.

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

23:59:08 You stroke the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

23:59:08 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

23:59:30 Lily Kaise slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it and goes to sleep.
