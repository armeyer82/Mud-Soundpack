You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.

Tradesman Certificates
--------------------------------------------------
Tradesman item certificates are a method for a donator to redeem a request to use at a later date. Such requests are placed into a secondary queue, and do not take priority over items requested on Empanda Station. They can also be gifted to other players if you're feeling generous enough! It doesn't matter if the recipient of the gift is a donator or not. It may also be worth noting that the exchange and use of tradesman certificates is out of character, thus you can use and obtain them anywhere in the game except for locations that reside out of communications range (but can't talk about them via IC communication).
Furthermore, tradesman certificates may only be submitted once every two weeks. If you submit a tradesman item certificate and it is completed a day later, you may not submit another one for up to two weeks after that time. Rejections do not incur a waiting period.
 
Commands:
  @CGIVE <person>
Give <person> a tradesman certificate. Once you have selected a player to gift, you will be prompted for the amount of tradesman certificates you wish to transfer. You can't give more than you have in your account. Typing the command without arguments will prompt you for a player's name. Once complete, you'll see something like:
        You give 1 tradesman certificate to Mitchell Morganivich Mihola.
The recipient will see:
        Mitchell Morganivich Mihola has just given you 1 tradesman certificate.
 
  @CREQUEST
Request an item using one of your available certificates. You will be presented with a menu, similar to the one that appears in the Empanda Station tradesman concourse. You must have at least one tradesman certificate to utilize this command. For sake of immersion, this command cannot be utilized while out of communications range. Complete all tradesman requests prior to leaving local space.
 
  @REQUEST-CERT
Redeem a certificate. You will be prompted to confirm the request, and once complete, a tradesman item certificate will be added to your account.
 
  @CERT-MARKET
Enter the tradesman item certificate marketplace. You can sell or buy tradesman certificates here for credits. The command may be shortened down to @CM for brevity. Be warned that trades are not audited by the Toastsoft hosts. Confirm at your own risk!
You may also type @CM [on | off] to connect or disconnect from the tradesman market channel. Notifications of new and completed sales are announced here.
 
  REQUESTCHECK
See if you're eligible to request a donator item. Note: similarly to the commands above, this command is out of character.
 
Notes:
* Tradesman certificates are attached to your account, not your character. This means they stay with you through rerolls.
* If your request is rejected, you will receive a tradesman certificate redemption token in the mai
22:59 l.
--------------------------------------------------

22:59 It looks like you've already used a request for this month.

22:59 You can request your next donator tradesman item in 4 days, 6 hours, and 27 seconds on Thu Sep 28 22:00:01 2017 CDT. You can submit a tradesman item certificate now!
