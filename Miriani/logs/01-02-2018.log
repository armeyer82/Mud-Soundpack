00:41 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

00:43 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:43 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

00:43 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:43 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

00:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

00:43 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:43 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

00:43 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:43 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:43 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:43 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

00:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

01:44 Miriam Valleris (C) (Female) is asleep!

01:44 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

01:44 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:44 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

01:44 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:44 The starship must be in space.

01:44 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:44 The sensors are unable to pinpoint the starship's current coordinates.

01:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:44 Current coordinates: 6, 18, 9

01:44 Current coordinates: 6, 18, 9

01:44 I don't understand that.

01:45 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:45 #$#soundpack_pong

01:45 #$#soundpack_lag 107

01:45 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:45 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:45 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

01:45 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:45 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

01:45 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

01:45 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:45 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

01:45 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20).

01:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

01:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:45 The starship is already moving.

01:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:45 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

01:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

01:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:46 #$#soundpack_pong

01:46 #$#soundpack_lag 138

01:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:46 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy, and a hologram of a flower garden projected in the middle of the room here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here, sleeping.
You can go east.

13:41 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.

16:11 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Are new Asteroids spawned/created, or is there a finite amounti in the game's universe?

16:12 #$#soundpack_pong

16:12 #$#soundpack_lag 119

16:12 [Newbie] Jason Harkness: They're randomly created when a sector is generated.

16:13 #$#soundpack_pong

16:13 #$#soundpack_lag 115

16:13 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Is sector information saved, or is the sector generated on entry?

16:14 #$#soundpack_pong

16:14 #$#soundpack_lag 110

16:14 [Newbie] Jason Harkness: I believe they hang around for a minute or so after you leave them, unless there's a planet or something else along those lines in. So essentially, they do purge out, but a new one will pop upon reentry. If you can follow that.

16:14 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Ah, so I could just keep using 8 and eventually I will hit an asteroid.

16:15 #$#soundpack_pong

16:15 #$#soundpack_lag 118

16:15 [Newbie] Jason Harkness: In theory, yes. But you have to leave it for a minute or so to force it to repop. Better to just keep moving.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.

23:33 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

23:42 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] You transmit, "Sure."

23:42 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

23:42 You need to stand up first.

23:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:42 You stand up.

23:42 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "Gamma."

23:42 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:42 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] You transmit, "on my way"

23:42 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:42 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

23:42 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

23:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:43 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

23:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:43 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

23:43 You stand up.

23:46 Space.

23:46 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:46 There is currently an estimated 0 ms of server CPU lag and 105 ms of local client lag.

23:46 Moiraine Yobi's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "are we all here?"

23:46 #$#soundpack social | snore | male

23:46 Chet Daniels snores over the intercom.

23:46 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I am not here."

23:46 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:46 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:46 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:46 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:46 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

23:46 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:46 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

23:46 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:46 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:47 #$#soundpack_pong

23:47 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:47 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:47 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
