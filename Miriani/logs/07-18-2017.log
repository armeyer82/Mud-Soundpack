   (4:51 p.m.) [General Communication] High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle transmits, "At the moment, we are conferencing with High Guard and Krenelia representatives in regards to that very question. After seeing numbers like those in stage six, without a full High Guard squad at my back, I would not feel confident putting all of your resources at risk. For now, we hold off on stage seven. I will dismiss your crews, and give you all time for recovery. I hope we can discuss these matters at length tomorrow. For the moment, you may leave your starships in stage one if you wish, or pull them out. I would appreciate keeping your industrial starships in the stage, but I would encourage you to turn your warships to missioning and being productive in the defense of our space."

00:04 ["Critical Strike" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see Miriam Valleris here, sleeping.
You can go south and out.

00:04 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:04 [Private | Emily Sanders] Emily Sanders transmits, "ok"

00:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:04 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:04 There are no ships here.

00:04 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:04 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

00:04 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:04 [Private | Emily Sanders] Emily Sanders transmits, "just tell me when"

00:04 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

00:05 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:05 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

00:05 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:05 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:05 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:05 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

00:05 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:05 The starship must be in space.

00:05 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:05 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:05 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:05 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:05 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:05 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

00:05 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:05 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:05 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:05 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:05 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

00:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Critical Strike. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:05 The three-person voyager "Beyond" has launched from Acrylon.

00:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

00:06 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:06 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

00:06 Miriam Valleris is already a member of your group.

00:21 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

00:59 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room.

A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

To the person who stole Light Of The Trees:
While I do not like to use the word steal, that is what comes to mind. If you did not steal it, I ask you to return it as a sign of good faith and unity in these troubled times. If you did steal it, I am willing to discuss payment for its safe return. You can cotact me via comm or letter. Thank you very much.

11:13 [Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

11:43 [Alliance High Guard Command; Starship Store]
This lavishly decorated store is probably the brightest and cheeriest on the level. Helpful salesdroids roll about from place to place, greeting new customers as they enter and wishing them a good day as they leave. Large pedistals take up most of the available floorspace, each with a scale model starship perched atop. Embedded into each of the pedistals is a computer with information on the ship classes scrolling on it. Beneath each computer is a series of buttons, each clearly labeled as to their function. The button furthest to the left reads MENU, next to it is INFO, POINTS comes next, and last is BUY. A small machine in one corner of the shop proclaims that it manipulates keys. Three buttons are on the front of this machine beneath a narrow slot. Under the buttons is a much larger slot. The buttons read MAKE, DUPLICATE and INVALIDATE. To either side of the doorway are a pair of guards that appear to be deep in conversation about various pros and cons of each starship class. An ornate archway leads to another room, and hung above it is a sign with bold lettering proclaiming it to be a starship registry.

12:14 Jessica Marin presses a button, calling up the damage report.

12:14 [General Communication] Miriam Valleris transmits, "Last call, 1 spot mods?"

12:14 Jessica Marin peers at a small display, examining the cargo manifest.

12:14 A chime sounds, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

12:14 Miriam Valleris sashays in from the airlock.

12:15 Miriam Valleris begins the debris transfer process.

12:15 You hear several loud thuds as cargo is transferred from the ship.

12:15 You hear the bustle of activity from the ship's cargo hold.

12:15 A haunting screech drifts in from the storage room as something heavy is dragged across the floor.

12:15 The noises coming from the storage room gradually cease until they can be heard no more.

12:15 Miriam Valleris says, "there we go"

12:15 Jessica Marin says, "you fly good."

12:15 Miriam Valleris says, "true"

12:15 Miriam Valleris says, "off we go!" into a small microphone mounted on the wall.

12:15 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request launch clearance.

12:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Demonic Demonstration, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:15 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Demonic Demonstration" has launched from Rolukssica.

12:15 Jessica Marin glides south.

12:15 A diamond-encrusted platinum medical drone, a diamond-encrusted platinum medical drone, Joe the droid, and Jess the droid leave the area behind Jessica Marin.

12:15 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

12:15 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:15 Miriam Valleris says, "your turn, captain"

12:16 Miriam Valleris sashays south.

12:16 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:16 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

12:16 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

12:16 The starship is already moving.

12:16 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

12:16 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Demonic Demonstration" has initiated an intrasector slip.

12:16 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:16 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

12:16 The ship is already on that status level.

12:16 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Demonic Demonstration" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

12:16 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

12:16 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:16 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

12:16 The ship must be in space to do that.

12:16 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

12:16 The computer announces, "Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

12:16 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

12:16 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:16 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:16 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

13:15 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:15 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.

13:16 Miriam Valleris leans in toward you and gently kisses your lips.

13:16 I don't understand that.

13:16 You smile.

13:16 #$#soundpack social | smile | male

13:16 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:16 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:16 Miriam Valleris sashays south.

13:16 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:16 The ship is already on that status level.

13:16 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:16 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Demonic Demonstration" has initiated an intrasector slip.

13:16 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:16 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:16 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Demonic Demonstration" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

13:16 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:16 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:16 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:16 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:16 The computer announces, "Eight starships have been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:16 Dorion Hunter strides in from the south.

13:16 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:16 Dorion Hunter utters a terrified scream!

13:16 #$#soundpack social | scream | male

13:16 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:16 Dorion Hunter collapses at your feet.

13:16 #$#soundpack social | coll | male

13:16 Dorion Hunter stands up.

13:16 Dorion Hunter strides south.

13:16 Miriam Valleris sashays in from the south.

13:16 Miriam Valleris sashays south.

13:16 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

13:16 Dorion Hunter's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Tib is flying."

13:17 Dorion Hunter's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Time to buckle in."

13:17 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Yeah, be scared."

[Empanda Station; Observation Center]
A gentle beeping comes from the expansive array of equipment that covers the off-white walls of this small observation center. The dome-shaped ceiling is made of glass, revealing the twinkling blackness of space beyond. Each time spacial activity is detected in the sector, a small holographic depiction is cast into the air by one of the glowing computer monitors in the center of the room. The only illumination comes from the soft blue glow emitted by the technology that lines the area, and a collection of standard black chairs have been pushed against the wall near the entrance to provide a place for people to sit.
You see a large leather couch, a shiny silver trash bin, Mod the droid, William the droid, Mell the droid, Wade the droid, Manslaughter the droid, Arielle the droid, Jabberjaw the droid, Claudia the droid, Doh the droid, Prototype the droid, Tka the droid, Nomore the droid, Dean the droid, AnahraPops the droid, Melisha the droid, Fire the droid, Crystal the droid, Iseeyou the droid, Blame the droid, Emily the droid, Caris the droid, Panda the droid, Ken the droid, Camira the droid, Woe the droid, and Shaleah the droid here.

18:04 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room] (sitting on a leather-covered cherrywood captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 251270; Starship Parking Facility.

18:09 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "Coming."

18:09 You say, "onati carrier."

18:09 Miriam Valleris pushes a small lever away from herself, activating the ship's systems.

18:09 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

18:09 Miriam Valleris says, "okay"

18:09 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "Same!"

18:09 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request launch clearance.

18:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Galactic Rainbow, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:09 The ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" has left the sector.

18:09 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Miriam and I are on the way."

18:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:09 There are no ships here.

18:09 Miriam Valleris presses a series of buttons on the FTL control console.

18:09 The computer announces, "Precision wormhole drive is powering up. Calculating optimal path for precision entry..."

18:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:09 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Bellerophon, a Hale starship is under attack by an Ontanka starship!"

18:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:09 You are already following somebody.

18:10 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

18:10 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:10 Miriam Valleris stands up.

18:10 The computer announces, "Three starships and two planets have been detected in the sector."

18:10 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:10 You say, "oops"

18:10 Praelor Bezation 106 has fired at the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion".

18:10 Miriam Valleris inputs some coordinates into a navigational control console.

18:10 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request landing clearance.

18:10 You stand up.

18:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Galactic Rainbow. We read your Commonwealth transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

18:10 The ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

18:10 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

18:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:06 Emily Sanders says, "you did as much as you can and or could to help"

20:06 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I expect because of your involvement in the situation, the trial will be public. You are all more than welcome to attend. I will state my full case there, and argue for what I believe to be the proper choices during yesterday's combat situation."

20:08 Cria Blur says, "its ok, i'd like to stand here"

20:08 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I will let those who were already in attendance catch you both up after the meeting."

20:09 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "But on to the matter at hand. The Krenelia, and stage seven."

20:09 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "The long-range scan cloak has been proven fully functional by the Krenelia as of yesterday afternoon's retaliation in stage six."

20:10 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "We will not be imploring this technology in stage seven, but it will become incredibly valuable on the direct Kritzn strike."

20:11 Cara West exclaims, "that's good!"

20:11 Ray Ridgeway nods.

20:12 Daniel Karero nods.

20:12 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I have been removed from the team planning for the final part of this operation, however, so I'm ultimately unsure as of progress. At present, I am only in charge of the stage seven attack."

20:13 Calyssa Calaway nods

20:13 Tibo Beauchene nods.

20:13 Cara West asks, "do we know, when the stage 7 attack will be?"

20:13 Ray Ridgeway says, "I can not speak for everyone here, but I will personally do my best to be present and fight."

20:13 Diana West nods.

20:13 Therman Donaldson says, "I prefer you than some alternative representative. since we worked with you from the start of this whole mess"

20:14 Ray Ridgeway nods in hole-hearted agreement with Therman Donaldson.

20:14 You say, "Same here."

20:14 Cara West totally agrees with Ray Ridgeway and Therman Donaldson

20:14 Diana West agrees with everyone so fr.

20:15 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I have more good news for you all, however. as most of you know, the point of our strike against Praelor fleets was to divert the Ontanka from realizing our actual mission. It succeeded. We have discovered what we believe to be the centralized location of the Kritzn manufacturing fissility."

20:15 A high-capacity transparent Lore computer beeps quietly, indicating that its TransLink tracking functionality has been activated.

20:16 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle asks Michael Calaway, "As we have had several late arrivals, would you mind catching them up before I proceed?"

20:17 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Oh, actually someone just arrived."

20:17 Michael Calaway says, "sure, let's see"

20:17 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "So, come on down."

20:17 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Hurry though."

20:17 Joseph Navarro asks, "you're on trial for allowing unsupervised access to the leviathan, you guys located the Kritzn facility, and that's it, am I right?"

20:17 Michael Calaway says to Joseph Navarro, "wait to beat me to it"

20:17 Joseph Navarro exclaims, "I'm all about expediency!"

20:18 Calyssa Calaway says, "pretty much everything lol"

20:18 Carrie Reid says, "and the long-range cloaking works."

20:18 Calyssa Calaway says, "oh yes"

20:18 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle nods to Carrie Reid.

20:18 #$#soundpack social | nod | female

20:18 You don't see that here.

20:18 Tibo Beauchene nods

20:18 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "This is why it is even more important that we divert the Ontanka from knowing where we truly intend to strike. Thus, stage seven. The final battle ground for me, and the last one we fight before moving for the Kritzn laboratory itself."

20:19 Cara West says, "considering what we got yesterday... this is going to be quite ugly."

20:19 Ryan Salvatore says, "Um."

20:19 Ryan Salvatore asks, "You got in trouble?"

20:19 Michael Calaway says to High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle, "it isn't over till it's over, so dont be so sure it will be your last as yet."

20:19 Therman Donaldson says, "she left the leviathan unsupervised."

20:20 Joseph Navarro exclaims, "Yeah maybe we'll all keep blowing up before we get to the Kritzn lab, so she'll have to keep helping us out for lack of completing the mission. Don't lose hope my friends!"

20:20 Cara West says, "and people started playing with cloak and mimic and what have you"

20:20 You peer out and see...

20:20 [Alliance High Guard Command; Eastern Corridor]
A thin pale blue carpet stretches between the mirrored walls of this wide corridor. Set every few feet along the outer wall, reinforced windows afford a view of the area of the moon immediately surrounding the spaceport. The corridor is lit by the harsh white glare of the lights set into the ceiling. A significant amount of noise and conversation spills out of a large room to the northeast. An ominous-looking steel door is in the southern wall, and behind it lies a briefing room. Two huge guards stand watch in front of the door, hands resting on weapons and stoney expressions on their faces.
You see an ominous-looking steel door, a gleaming black security drone, Ia the droid, Eo the droid, Lioness the droid, Peter the droid, Sinful the droid, and a Proboscis Monkey here.
You can go northeast and west.

20:20 Ryan Salvatore says, "Okay, I'll blow up and everyone else can so she's the only one left."

20:20 Therman Donaldson says, "mimic, cloak. that was all that was toyed with."

20:20 Joseph Navarro says to Ryan Salvatore, "You get me"

20:20 Ryan Salvatore says, "You all should've known better to mess with anything anyways."

20:20 Cara West says, "noah said as much."

20:20 Calyssa Calaway says, "have to agree with ryan here"

20:21 Cara West says, "and amy put a stop to it."

20:21 Andreas Fierro says, "same"

20:21 Dorion Hunter says, "i agree with ryan. just wow."

20:21 Joseph Navarro says, "anyway, guys, this is off-topic"

20:21 Ryan Salvatore says, "Yes, sorry."

20:21 Michael Calaway says, "wasn't inside so not sure what or who happened"

20:22 Therman Donaldson says, "since i sat in 13 onboard the ship, we got bored waiting for the captain to arrive, technology got accessed that wasn't supposed to be accessed, noah got mad and started getting rude. well the rest is up for you to decide. I'm finished summarizing."

20:22 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says to Michael Calaway, "I hope not, but I must prepare for the worst. In times like these, my superiors are not particularly known for their leniency. I will make my full case during the trial, and will personally call those who toyed with the leviathan's technologies to task. While I am held responsible for the leviathan by High Guard, they will not take kindly to those who took it upon themselves to experiment with it's capabilities in my absence."

20:23 Michael Calaway nods to High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle

20:23 Cara West says, "as is your right."

20:23 #$#hjelp

20:23 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "Regardless, we have a stage to complete."

20:24 Primus ElCielo says, "Just as Noah was telling that lot yesterday...."

20:24 Tiberius Black sits down on a semi-circular section of wooden seats with gray cushions.

20:24 Cara West says, "agreed"

20:24 Tiberius Black flicks a switch on a white metafrequency earpiece.

20:24 Michael Calaway asks High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle, "so what are the plans for stage 7?"

20:25 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Someone else just arrived, so you could still sneak in."

20:26 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "As I mentioned at the beginning of our meeting, my resources have been cut. I will only have enough personnel to crew one of your battlecruisers."

20:27 Primus ElCielo says, "Am I to assume that access to the leviathan has also been cut from our resources"

20:27 Andreas Fierro says, "um woh"

20:27 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle shakes her head at Primus ElCielo.

20:27 #$#soundpack social | headshake | female

20:27 Primus ElCielo says, "Well, at least they have some sense"

20:27 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I own Tyranny's End until the outcome of my trial."

20:27 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "However, High Guard does not control the resources I receive through our allies in the Krenelia."

20:28 Ray Ridgeway nods

20:28 Tibo Beauchene nods.

20:28 Tiberius Black asks, "cut? Is this strike not as important as we once believed?"

20:28 Joseph Navarro says, "It's not that. She's in trouble for allowing unsupervised access to her leviathan, so the higher ups are taking it out on her by limiting her resources."

20:28 Ryan Salvatore says to you, "People will fill you in after. That's not why."

20:28 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says to Tiberius Black, "It is important. However, my superiors thought it more prudent to cut my resources as a punishment than to insure the success of our operation."

20:28 Tiberius Black says, "ahh"

20:28 Ryan Salvatore says to you, "Not you bud."

20:29 Tiberius Black says, "wow"

20:29 Therman Donaldson says, "severely limited, I'd say."

20:29 Andreas Fierro says, "that's harsh"

20:29 Dorion Hunter says, "it is."

20:29 You say to Ryan Salvatore, "It's ok. I knew who you were talking to."

20:30 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle is now the speaker.

20:32 Tiberius Black presses a small button on a black flight control scanner.

20:32 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I have discussed the mutual benefits of Krenelia augmenting our drastically reduced attack force, and their representative agrees. We will not have a mere two or three ships as I previously assumed. The Krenelia have placed three squadrons of their Ohaxx, and ironically, half a squad of Bezation at my command. This means we have a total 42 Krenelia starships at our access, which I can strategically deploy."

20:36 Therman Donaldson says, "something like that. anyway."

20:36 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle is now the speaker.

20:37 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "I have done my own investigations, and have determined Jessie Vargus to be the primary offender in toying with the leviathan. it is not up to me whether she takes part in the operation aboard your starships, but she is no longer welcome aboard mine."

20:39 Tiberius Black asks, "what is the use of waiting?"

20:40 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: Yes, there is a planet which offers that service. Some people have bots to do it as well.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.
