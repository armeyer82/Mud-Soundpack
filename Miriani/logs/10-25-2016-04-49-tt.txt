Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named
Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, an insulated blue cooler, a high tech silver star print holovid,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a red plastic food storage container, and
Samantha the old large violet felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway, not our problem but just shows
Kim either can't think for herself or she doesn't care."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "All of that spouting off about relaitons

'Most likely.
You say, "Most likely."
'Especially, Melinda.

Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

thought about any of the suggestions I have. All Kim wants to do is use the
donations box. I want to involve other alliances just as League does in
fund-raising."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think it would be fun to get Ather to
host another last pilot standing event where everybody gets in and fights it out
in a big free for all. We'd sell entry fees as a fund-raiser perhaps."
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up

'That would be fun!
You exclaim, "That would be fun!"
'He would win of course.
You say, "He would win of course."

projects."
'Ah, ok
You say, "Ah, ok."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Don't mention any of this because if I
lose, I can almost bet you that Kim will just raise the point of the donations
box. So if it falls flat, then what has she done for those who cannot afford
medical treatment in the AEU?"
nod 'I won't mention anything.
You nod. "I won't mention anything."

You kiss Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I didn't think so. You don't talk to her

'It really wasn't the right time.
You say, "It really wasn't the right time."

your leaving Starseekers?"
'Not really
You say, "Not really."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah and i'm still uncertain with the
election coming up."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips,
groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left
