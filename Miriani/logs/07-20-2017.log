Tibo my Dearest love,
All that i can say about your defensiveness is that only time will tell who is really being honest, faithful and truthful. What was transmitted to me was that she does sleep around and perhaps she isn't currently but trust me, it came from a reliable source who you may or may not be close to anymore and in fact it's someone you've defended before. Based upon how childishly she comes across, the honeymoon will grow sour before long. Anytime one rushes into wild intimacy, then what else is there left to discover?
The reason why I was wanting to turn the ship around was because yes, you wanted me to keep flying while engaging in other things in the ship away from the Control room. at that time, you were such a new pilot and I wasn't yet certain how you could assist me should a Muzano or otherwise emerge. now, i would be very comfortable with you and certainly would take time out to enjoy our hot tub and oh so much more. I have already faught hard battles alone and I have lost enough out in deep space. It took me months to recoup enough to get another gunship upgraded and then my Dart was stolen. So kindly please try to see where I was coming from? Also, I wasn't quite ready to be intimate with you. I don't believe in using intimacy to get what I need and I never have. For all that i knew, when we got back, you could have taken the credits you earned and gone your own way. Also what if I had done the same and just used you sexually?
Tibo, I'm not always right too yet I certainly am strong-willed and believe in what I believe and you know, you just needed to persist and accept it that I might not always agree with you. i have changed my mind, my opinion and other things many times and it's so sad that you make it an excuse not to have wanted to try. Honestly, I believe you would have been quite surprised in the end had you spoken up for whatever you felt strongly about. i have grown to respect you moreso as you have emerged as a great pilot. I have certainly held back on expressing my thoughts on some of the actions you have taken. I wasn't in favor of your joining Insanity for one but I felt that you had to make your own choices concerning which organization you elected to join. I felt that they would likely have stopped bothering you after a point had you not joined insanity but since you left, that just provided fawkes and company another excuse to hunt you. Still, you did what you thought was right for you and I don't hold it against you. I'm sad that it has turned out the way it has in terms of Fawkes and company and in spite of their downfall too. Nobody is right all of the time either and I sure am not. I but just as you are in such disagreement with me right now. You won't admit it that you've made a serious mistake with us.I'm sad for you and especially us. I know that you will soon get away from the clutches of this individual who sounds like a 3-year old screaming on Chatter. What sort of substance is there in 3-year-old behavior?
Again I'm as I said, I'm glad that you got your Transverser back and that i was wrong concerning how it was being used or transported.
I still believe her actions were just to win you over and that it's only a matter of time what her true intentions really are. If someone wants to take advantage, they aren't typically going to do their dirty work up front. They will win your trust and then they have you exactly where they want you. She certainly isn't going to admit to you what her intentions are no matter how you confront her either so I just laughed the other day when she went all emo on Chatter. Her very defensiveness was a tell all that she had been caught out and I laughed thinking who is she trying to fool except you of course?
As I told you on our private link. I'm still here for you and I love you and I love you sincerely and not for just what I was looking forward to as the most wonderful experience with you. It still hurts that when I couldn't be available that you are using it against me. If you had personal reasons why you couldn't work or be available for me, I would not turn my back on you. I would not leave you because we all have times when we are not at our best or when we in our top form. Still if we were to marry, there is a vow which states that you love one another through thick an
05:09 d thin and through better or worse and many other things. If we were to have married are you not committed to those things? Well I am my Darling.
I love you forever.
Your forever faithful and loving,
Kitty

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access t
11:56 o the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

12:23 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access t
12:52 o the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

13:07 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access t
13:23 o the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access t
14:13 o the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

14:30 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light

14:30 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.
You see a leather-covered cherrywood captain's chair and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
You see Miriam Valleris (distracted) here.
You can go east, south, and out.
You disconnect from your avatar.

16:02 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.
You see a leather-covered cherrywood captain's chair and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
You see Miriam Valleris (distracted) here.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access t
16:20 o the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

17:37 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.

Architectural Design Simulators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Architectural design simulators allow you to build and customize property to add to the game. Through a holographic avatar of yourself, you can configure and customize a blueprint to your liking. All building commands work inside a blueprint, and no charge is incurred for your character in reality.

  Getting Started
Once you have purchased an architectural design simulator, you should BOLT it down and USE it. You will be presented with a number of options, most prominently to create, edit, or delete a blueprint. To get started, choose 'Create Blueprint' and follow the prompts.
First, you will be asked for a name. This name should be indicative of what you wish your completed area to be called. It cannot have punctuation save for hyphens, and it will appear before each room name when you are in the area itself. Once you have decided on a name, you will arrive in a menu of choices for which real estate you wish to simulate. If you are building this property for yourself, pick what type of structure it should be upon finalization. If you are building this area for eventual inclusion in the game's global geographics, choose house. Be sure that you have spoken with a host prior to building an area for general inclusion, as you will need permission to add a public area to a pre-built planet.  Public areas should be thematically appropriate and not offer exclusive benefits to the person creating it. If your simulator is bolted in a private structure that you are an owner of, you will also be presented with the option to import it in as a new design. This may be useful for experimenting with possible new additions to your current structure. Submissions of imported designs will not, however, usually be accepted. If you wish to update your current design, you need to build it by hand.
Finally, you will be asked if you want to password protect this blueprint. If other people have access to the simulator and you do not want them modifying the design, choose yes and enter a password. Passwords are encrypted one-way, so if you forget your password, it cannot be read or recovered by a host. Keep this in mind when adding a password.

  Building
Once you have finished configuring your blueprint, you will be connected to a holographic avatar. Your avatar is naked, and thus lacks a communicator, message board reader or other gadgets. You can use the NEWBIE channel or the DESIGN channel. The design channel is IC and allows you to speak to any other avatars that may be connected to the blueprint. It should not be used to circumvent communicators.
Most building commands work inside of a blueprint. For more detail on these, review HELP BUILDING COMMANDS. You cannot create or submit stores inside of a blueprint, nor can you access authorization lists or use security center functions. Similarly, holographic avatars can move through any biometrically locked exit without requiring authorization. There are some commands that are exclusive to building avatars, which are listed below.

DESIGN <text | who> - Speak on the design channel. This channel employs minimal filtration and is for conversing about your design with other avatars that may be connected. It should remain in character. Providing the [who] argument will show other avatars that are connected to your design.
@DESCRIBE/DESCRIBE <object | here> as <text> - Describe <object>. Using "here" as the object will describe the room you are standing in. If you wish to have a multi-line description, use the syntax DESCRIBE <object> by itself instead.
CREATE <name> - Create a custom item. Custom items can be props, containers or furniture and there is a limit; 5 for a house, 10 for a space station, 15 for a moon and 20 for a planet. Each item will add 5,000,000 credits to the final cost of the blueprint.
DESTROY <item> - Destroy an item. This is not reversible.
DIG-GO <exit name> to <room> - Digs a go exit with the provided name. If you don't provide a name, the room name will default to "New Room".
DEMOLISH-GO <go exit> - Demolishes a go exit. The other side must not have any connecting rooms.
ENVIRONMENT (or ENV) - Alter the environment of a room.
EXIT-MESSAGES (or EXITMSG) <exit> - Set messages that are shown when moving through an exit. Pronouns and other substitutions can be used here.
PRONOUNS - Show a list of pronouns that can be used in various messages.
LIGHTING (or LIGHTS) - Turn lighting on or off in a room. Rooms that are not lit will not show descriptions or contents.
DOORTYPE - Change the door type for an entrance accessible with the ENTER-command. You must be standing in the room with the entrance.
ROOMFIX (or DEMOLISH HERE) - Remove a room that has no exits, go exits, or enter exits and move your avatar back to the first room of the blueprint.
ROOMS - View all rooms in your blueprint.
WORTH - View a cost breakdown for the entire blueprint. This is how much you will need to pay once you wish to make this design a reality.
ZAP (or TELEPORT) <room name> - Instantly transport your avatar to <room name>.
ADDNOTE <text> - Add notes for a specific room. Notes can be deleted or reviewed through the manage notes function when modifying your blueprint. You should leave a note in the room that you wish to set as a docking bay or landing pad if you are making anything other than a house.
END - Terminates the simulation.

  Further Customization
The second option in the initial menu allows one to edit blueprint parameters. If your blueprint is password protected, you will need the password to access and change settings.

Change Parent - Change the type of structure that governs your design.
Enable/Disable Map - Toggle specific mapping on your blueprint. This defines whether people can type MAP [room] to receive directions to a specific room.
Rename - Change the name of a blueprint.
Add/Change Password - Change an existing password. If you have not set a password, this option will guide you through adding one. If you wish to clear the password, type the old password and then leave the new password field blank.
Manage Notes - Add or delete attached notes. Notes should detail special accommodations for your structure such as lifts and should also include where you wish to place it in the real game world.
Set Sector Coordinates - Set coordinates for a private station, moon, or planet. These will be the coordinates that your new structure occupies in the sector once it has been physically built.

  Submitting Blueprints
Once you have finished your blueprint, you should submit it. Keep in mind that you cannot submit a design if you lack the points to own it. Submission can be done through the simulator menu and puts your design in a queue for hosts to review. While your blueprint is in the queue you will not be able to access or modify it. Once it has been approved, a host will approach you to take payment and implement your design into the world. Be sure to include painful amounts of detail in the notes attached, lest it not be done exactly how you intended.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

20:59 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.
You see a leather-covered cherrywood captain's chair and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
You see Miriam Valleris (staring into space) here.

22:16 Miriam Valleris
She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This 24 year old woman stands 5 feet and 10 inches tall and is lithe with a large bust size. She has a dark complexion. Her waist-length, midnight black hair is pulled back in an elegant French twist and tied back with white silk ribbons and dotted with shimmering blue sapphires and diamonds. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.
She has a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her left earlobe and a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat and the nails on her right hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat.
For a top, she is wearing a long sleeved midnight blue chiffon blouse with a flower-shaped diamond broach pinned above the left breast over a pretty midnight black Bandeau bra with a shimmering crystal sphere set between the cups. For a bottom, she is wearing a fitted vivid blue velvet wrap skirt adorned with tears of stunning alien crystal over a black sexy Brazilian thong with lace frills on the front. She is wearing a pair of pale blue satin heeled sandals with tiny diamonds along the straps on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an archaeological artifact storage container, a level one archaeological dig site scanner, a black spacesuit navi
22:16 gational computer, a black spacesuit jet, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, and a white fuzzy artifact storage container.
She is carrying nothing.

22:16 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request launch clearance.

22:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Galactic Rainbow, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

22:16 You sit down on a leather-covered cherrywood captain's chair.

22:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:16 Miriam Valleris presses a series of buttons on the FTL control console.

22:16 The computer announces, "Precision wormhole drive is powering up. Calculating optimal path for precision entry..."

22:16 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.

22:16 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:16 Miriam Valleris leans in toward you and gently kisses your lips.

22:16 #$#soundpack social | kiss | female
The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:16 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

22:16 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:17 Miriam Valleris stands up.

22:17 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

22:17 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
You stand up.

22:17 Miriam Valleris inputs some coordinates into a navigational control console.

You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
