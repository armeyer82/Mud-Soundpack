Hi Shule and Lily, I hope you're both doing okay.
I'm sending you both this exact letter, in case one of you is around, and the
other isn't, so that you see it.
Firstly, my thanks go to you both, yet again, for doing your best for 777. I
know that people are making your efforts difficult, but when you want to scream,
try and remember those of us who appreciate your efforts like me, and Damien. We
admire the stubborn way you just will not let up.
Second, since I have noticed either of you have been around to work much fo
late, and I believe you mentioned it as well, I wanted to extend an offer of
help to you, with anything you like, be it building stations, or double checking
that felo are fed.
I know what it's like when you can't work much, so my support is here, should
you wish it.
You know I am not one of the drama kinds of people, and proudly call you both
friends, so if there's anything I can do, no matter how small or large, please
don't hesitate to ask me.
And lastly, I would be super happy, if you could let me know where in all the
planets you found that amazing corn, and those ribs that you had on Johann's
trip. They were just sensational, and I want to find them.
But most of all, please take care, and I gotta admit, I miss you both. It's
always nice when you're around.
Be safe,
Evenia.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a
pair of tan suede clogs, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a pair of white socks, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a soft red
heather cotton polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, a pair of white
cotton briefs, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

Tanny Hill
She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is lithe with slightly curved hips and narrow calves.
She has rounded shoulders and small breasts. Her abdomen is smooth and
punctuated by a tiny navel. Her face is average-shaped, lightly-freckled, and
girlish, with a small nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are thin and light-colored
and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of
expressive eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and wide. Her chin-length, straight
hair is phosphorescent octarine with metallic gold highlights and wild. She has
a small mole on her abdomen.
A small niobium stud pierces her tongue, a gleaming gold stud pierces her belly
button, and a tiny tinkling silver bell on a silver ring pierces her right
earlobe.
 She is wearing a torn black satin cropped top, a pair of dangerous-looking dark
red leather forearm bands with eleven rows of inch-long darkly gleaming brass
claw studs, a pair of black leather fingerless gloves, a black leather spiderweb
belt with a silver spider buckle, a pair of baggy black low rise jeans with
ripped knees, and a pair of black silk open-toed evening pumps. She is also
wearing a tattoo of the Cheshire Cat, a shiny deep saffron watch with a gold
fleur-de-lys on the face, a black guitar case, a dark metallic gray touch
einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a sparkling diamond eternity band,
a bulky asteroid supply cannon, and a tricky camera with a chain link strap. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, abdomen, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Tanny seems subtly tense, despite looking casual on the surface, and
occasionally drifts a finger along one of the claws on her forearm bands.

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
