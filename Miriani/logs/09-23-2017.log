00:33 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.

22:18 [Newbie] Sharla Craine: How do I recharge a ship?

22:18 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Just land.

22:18 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: You land on most planets or space stations, power off and then up on while landed, or if you are outside your ship on the landing pad, you can type, recharge (shipname)

22:19 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Definitely any capital planet and most planets, if not all, in sectors will do it...or what she said.

22:19 [Newbie] Sharla Craine: Thanks guys.

23:40 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Cargo transfer is inherent to ships, its not a special upgrade right?

23:40 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Not unles you're talking ship to ship.

23:40 [Newbie] Daryk Karlsen: I believe that's correct.

23:40 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: I am talking ship to ship.

23:41 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Then yes, it is an upgrade.

23:41 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Not Bard transfer though, just regular cargo.

23:41 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Oh.

23:42 [Newbie] Derrick Blade: Bard transfer is an upgrade, regular cargo is not. You can just dock and transfer cargo.
