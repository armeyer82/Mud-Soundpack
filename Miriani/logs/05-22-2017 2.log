00:17:03 (20 seconds roundtime.)

00:17:23 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a compact red refrigerator, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated pink cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash

00:53:09 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

01:27:07 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:27:27 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a compact red refrigerator, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated pink cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:27:46 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:27:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:27:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:27:56 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:28:01 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well tht was fun and productive!"

01:28:05 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

01:28:06 You exclaim, "It was!"

01:28:08 You grin.

01:28:11 Lily Kaise grins.

01:28:12 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:28:19 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:28:22 The starship has left a unique area of space.

01:29:55 You grin.

01:29:59 Lily Kaise beams.

01:30:04 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:30:04 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

01:30:05 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:30:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:25:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:25:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:25:28 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:25:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:25:28 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:25:31 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Star Of Destiny! Welcome to home space!"

02:25:34 Lily Kaise says, "I forgot I had the gem aboard."

02:25:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:25:37 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:25:39 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:25:39 You laugh.

02:25:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Star Of Destiny. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:25:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
Lily Kaise says, "Oh well."

02:25:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:25:57 You can't do that here.

02:25:59 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:26:00 I don't understand that.

02:27:32 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:27:37 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:27:39 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:27:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seventh Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:27:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:27:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:27:59 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:27:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Nine jumps to Teslaworld Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

02:34:35 You grin.

02:34:38 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:34:42 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:34:44 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:34:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:34:54 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:34:56 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Noooooo!"

02:34:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seventh Star, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:34:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:35:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Come back."

02:35:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:35:13 [General Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Who?"

02:35:14 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:35:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:35:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:35:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:35:20 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You silly."

02:35:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:35:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:35:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:35:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:35:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:35:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:35:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:35:27 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:35:30 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Seventh Star! Welcome to home space!"

02:35:34 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:35:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:35:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:36:00 Lily Kaise says, "I'm going to transfer in more funds to support."

02:36:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:36:04 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:36:05 You say, "Ok."

02:36:07 You say, "Cool."

02:36:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Seventh Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:36:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:36:10 Lily Kaise nods.

02:36:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:36:22 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:36:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:36:24 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:36:24 Lily Kaise glides out.
Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise.

02:36:24 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:36:26 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:36:28 You scramble to your feet.

02:36:28 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:36:29 You exit the ship.

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
02:36:40 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

You can go up and out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:49:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:49:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:49:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:50:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:50:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:50:07 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

02:50:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:50:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Six jumps to Beacon A-59. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:50:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:50:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Deep Wastes."

02:50:19 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:50:19 Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

02:50:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:50:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:50:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:50:22 The sensors tell you that this area is full of valuable salvage, but all you can see of it yourself is dark smudges that block the light of the stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Five jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:50:23 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-45."

02:50:24 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:31:20 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

03:31:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.
Lily Kaise says, "It went down this morning or just prior to midnight."

03:31:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:31:29 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

03:31:29 You say, "Ah, ok."

03:31:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:31:40 Lily Kaise says, "It had a league core on it which is why we didn't get notification."

03:31:44 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

03:31:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:31:45 You say, "Oh, ok."

03:38:42 Lily Kaise tickles you!

03:38:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:38:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:38:44 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

03:38:46 You laugh.

03:38:47 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."

04:58:43 Lily Kaise

04:58:43 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved cropped top of heavy dark purple cotton with pockets on the upper arms and a square cargo pocket in front, a pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue and coral pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
04:58:43  dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, abdomen, both wrists, both hands, waist, and both ankles are left uncovered.

04:58:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:30:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

13:30:34 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.

13:33:22 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

13:33:23 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

13:38:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:38:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:38:01 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: o:n!D%#9-F4=`}j9vU]H<-8$D5m2]q0s\#<k4cnE

13:40:23 The planet known as Teslaworld rotates below you, the atmosphere looking as impenetrable as that of a gas giant. The thick clouds roil with continual storms, and lightning flashes all across the sky many times a second.
The two-person medium transport "The Gift Of Forever" has fired a grapple into a tiny asteroid.

13:40:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Beacon A-64. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:40:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:40:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-64."

13:40:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:41:54 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:41:54 You scramble to your feet.

13:41:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Weapons Room]
You see a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.

13:41:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:41:56 You turn general communication off.

13:41:58 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:42:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

13:42:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:42:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

13:42:19 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Heya shule."

13:42:32 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yo."

13:42:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:42:47 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:42:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:42:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:42:55 [General Communication] Fidel Besacabras transmits, "Hey!"

13:43:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:43:06 You peer out...

13:43:06 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

13:43:08 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:43:13 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:43:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:43:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hi Chair."

13:43:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Um."

13:43:38 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Shule..."

13:43:43 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah not awake."

13:43:45 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

13:43:47 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

13:43:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's ok. I'm not totally awake either."

13:44:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I don't think anyone is today."

13:44:11 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

13:44:11 You can go out and enter into the ship.

13:44:13 You can't go that way.

13:44:15 You exit the ship.

13:44:15 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

13:44:19 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

13:44:19 You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

13:44:25 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm like must I do anything? If I had to gun, I would only do it in a Clipper at this point in time."

13:44:32 You glance at your communicator's screen.

13:44:32 There are no notices.

13:44:34 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

13:44:34 You can go up.

13:44:37 Board what?

13:44:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Why."

13:44:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Just why."

13:44:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

13:44:40 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

13:44:47 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Because you can sleep between shots."

13:44:48 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:44:48 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:44:53 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh good point."

13:44:57 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin yawns.

13:44:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

13:45:09 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

13:45:15 There appear to be 20 pilots recently active.

13:45:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's about right too."

13:45:33 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Pirate transport in a-61."

13:45:36 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They do get the job done though."

13:45:42 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, the only one that is around that has a clipper is me."

13:45:44 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "30 minutes later."

13:45:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have access to one."

13:46:02 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm probably being too harsh I've never actually used one."

13:46:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I did a good few beacons in Shules."

13:46:33 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, they do get the job done though and no, not 30 minutes later."

13:47:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, he only one awake that owns a clipper."

13:47:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If your engineer's worth their salt, it's not too bad. I will undercrew a stalwart or Avenger, I will not undercrew a clipper. Although, I hear Ather solos 'em. How, I'm not quite sure."

13:47:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Soloing a clipper is fun!"

13:47:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But that means no grid recharges."

13:48:17 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Grid has time to charge while you go and move, run back up when you're ready to shoot."

13:48:31 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And the enamy repairs?"

13:48:37 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "True, but it's really not that bad. I danced with a couple of pirates soloing in a clipper."

13:48:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pretty much."

13:48:52 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ah."

13:49:14 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Not to mention he probably has a bolt launcher in it."

13:49:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "As long as they're smaller than you I can see it. But don't think I could go up against something my own size soling in one."

13:49:30 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, I don't know if Ather does. But I do."

13:49:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Soloing rather."

13:49:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, I'd totally do it."

13:50:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They are actually probably great ships to solo in if that's what you want, the way they work."

13:50:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't generally take the risks other folks do either. Keep that in mind."

13:51:03 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It has almost the same speed as a fighter, even faster at maximum speed, and is a hell of a lot more powerful when it hits you."

13:51:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "With all those lasers, yeah."

13:51:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Has anyone tried soloing the fringe 16 chaingun thing?"

13:51:38 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Is there a place that one can adopt abandoned felo?"

13:51:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I believe Alexander has."

13:51:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "While I can solo in my gem or my tug against something like rats, spreaders, glyph sentries...with something that really moves I'm not sure I could."

13:52:42 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm hardly likely to ever solo a destroyer, but if I was, the Clipper or the Phanta would be it."

13:52:43 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, have you ever doubled flying and gunning in a gunship? It's similar to soloing in a clipper."

13:52:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have no Shule."

13:53:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not rather."

13:53:21 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Never solowed anything but fighter beacons."

13:53:24 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's fun to do too."

13:53:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've soloed a corvette enough times, but that's about it. And got hit a couple times goin to repair."

13:53:31 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "All that running around."

13:53:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]

13:53:55 You see a large leather chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.

13:54:05 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'll run around to take interdicters out, and then run out of the sector quick sharp if I'm in a bigger ship."

13:54:05 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

13:54:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:54:32 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:54:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh interdictors that don't move at all and don't hit back are a totally different thing entirely from an ememy that'll run around and kick your backside."

13:54:50 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles. "True."

13:54:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep, that's why I'll do it."

13:55:01 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm assuming you have to move the ship preemptively every time you leave the control room just in case you get locked on while you're not in the control room?"

13:55:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's kinda like a fighter. Move, run up and shoot, come down."

13:55:24 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Depends. You have to know the ships you're fighting."

13:56:57 Not much to see out there.

13:58:09 [General Communication] "If it's a rat, spreader, or glyph sentry, just stay put and kill it." Morris Corlew chuckles. "Otherwise..."

13:58:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Fire all the minis."

13:58:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Unless they run away from you, like they always seem to do to me."

13:59:47 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

13:59:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ted, stop scaring them away then."

14:00:43 [General Communication] "Well, if they run, yeah you gotta go after 'em." Morris Corlew laughs. "But yeah...if not, just stay and shoot."

14:01:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Maybe I am just that scary."

14:01:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

14:01:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

14:01:36 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Poor rat was chasing them all over yesterday so I could shoot them."

14:02:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:02:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

14:02:55 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Other pirate transport in clarkson's push."

14:03:05 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rar. Outta my space."

14:03:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:03:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:03:12 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:03:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:03:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:03:18 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Erik you headed to Crias?"

14:03:25 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Nah doing a salvage mission."

14:03:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:03:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Clarkson's Push. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:03:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:03:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

14:03:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:03:33 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 501" has docked with Space Station Alpha.

14:03:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:03:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:03:35 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:03:36 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Shipyards."

14:03:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:03:38 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. I'm on it then."

14:03:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:03:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:13:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:13:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
