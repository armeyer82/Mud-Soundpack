The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective
history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By
the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has
spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an
alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First
contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then
the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one
by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five
years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space,
bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this,
and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off
human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has
lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of
it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any
new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that
most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your
species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden
of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity
dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight
cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the
seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobicall
y close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control,
allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated
flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single
small turret. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations
that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the
station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet,
colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will
automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or
another navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there,
Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read
your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New
Phoenix."
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been
fully charged.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.
The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking

Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in
your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue
sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds
stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see Daizey the humanoid service robot, a glossy silver ceramic felo
chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's
chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a
vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing amethyst
and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid service robot,
a red plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah there's a lot of stations.
Unfortunately our sensors think they are beacons."
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first
point where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than
negligible. The star itself is merely a distant glinting point,
indistinguishable from any of the millions of distant but brighter stars
also in view. This is an Oort cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets,
asteroids, and similar interstellar flotsam.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight

jeans, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an

bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a

the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare
and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical
representation of the ship and its components, alongside current
estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a
wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a
distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches
tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a
small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a tight black t-shirt with a bright purple dragon
embroidered on the front, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and
a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate
ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard
