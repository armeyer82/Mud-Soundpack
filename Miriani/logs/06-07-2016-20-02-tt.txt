Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.

Star Conquest Help: Rerolling
--
Category: Background
--
Rerolling is the process of deleting your character and creating a new one. The
term derives from tabletop roleplaying games, where a character's stats had to
be determined from dice rolls, and thus to "reroll" was to start over with your
character. In character in Star Conquest, this process is usually called
"retiring" your character.
There are many reasons that people choose to reroll. The best reason to reroll
is that you feel your current character's story has been told and you'd like to
try something new. If this is your reason, and your character has been
well-roleplayed and your account is in good standing, please use the SUPPORT
command to speak to a host about your thoughts for ending your current character
and transitioning to a new one. We can help you finish your character's story
and often even arrange for some of your character's progress (usually just
points) to be gradually transferred to the new character. If your character has
NOT usually been well-roleplayed, we are less likely to do these things. Please
read Policy 14: Minievents for more information.
You should not invent your own wild retirement stories, nor have your next
character or your out-of-game friends try to invent things about your old
character. In the past, we've had rerolled characters supposedly die in horrible
accidents, be drafted into the navy, become an advisor to the president, and
somehow turn into a giant Bari, all of which were incompatible with the game's
theme. If you want a story for the end of your character besides quiet
retirement, you MUST speak to a host.
We have stated the best reason to reroll. There are also many poor reasons to
reroll, which are unfortunately more common than good ones. Here are some that
we see regularly:
* You did something silly, such as attacking an alliance-mate, and you don't
care for the consequences.
* You are unhappy with your organization, but talking to people is hard and
rerolling is easy.
* You are unhappy with your boyfriend/girlfriend, but breaking up is frightening
and rerolling is easy.
* You did something wrong out-of-character, such as scripting combat, and got a
penalty.
There are two things that every good roleplayer learns to deal with:
consequences and interpersonal conflict. You cannot expect your character to be
happy all of the time. Sometimes, you will do things that your character will
just have to live with. Sometimes, you will have to have hard, even unpleasant
conversations with other characters. These things are all part of a character's
story, not a reason to end it. It's the human experience.
Remember that bad things tend to pass. In roleplaying games, memories are short.
If you did something bad, you can probably be turning over a new leaf by next
month. If you're in the midst of a bad breakup, you'll probably both have moved
on in two weeks. Think twice before destroying a long-term character over
short-term issues. It's always better to weave something new into your
character's tapestry than to rip the whole thing up and start over.
Playing through a bad situation makes both you and your character stronger.
Rerolling is simply a passive-aggressive easy out. We will always encourage
players to stick with their characters in situations like these.
If you are committed to rerolling, there is one more important "don't": this is
not the time to take parting shots at your former friends, your alliance, your
organization, etc., nor is it time to suddenly launch your finest warship with
guns blazing to see how much damage you can do. Doing these things with the
knowledge that your character won't last the hour is out-of-character and
essentially metagaming. If you are going to have it out with other characters,
make it part of the ongoing story. The alternative may be satisfying for you,
but it's frustrating for everyone else.
If you rerolled purely to avoid consequences or for other essentially
out-of-character reasons, your character may be given a "reroll" tag on the WHO
list to denote this.
The process to reroll your character is to log out of Star Conquest, log back
in, and choose the "Delete Character" option. Follow the prompts, then create a
new character at the main menu.
There are three reasons why a character has been deleted:
1) You have violated policy repeatedly or proven yourself unable to play the
game without being a detriment to other players or the game itself.
2) You have not played the game in over six months AND had less than 1000
aggregate points.
3) You deleted the character yourself manually, for a reason mentioned above.
With none of the above being true, your character WILL exist in some fashion.
If 1) is true, your character will not be restored under any circumstances. 
Depending on the situation your account may also have been banned, in which case
you will no longer be eligible to play the game.
If 2) is true, then creating a new character with your old account and opening a
SUPPORT ticket in order to speak to us is the correct course of action if you
wish for your character to be restored.  However, if your previous character had
not left cadethood or had less than 100 points, we strongly suggested that you
simply use the newer character.  You may still request a restoration, though we
will explain why it is not a good idea.  If you have been actively playing the
game with your new character prior to the restoration request then it will be
denied.
If 3) is true, there is a 48 hour 'Deleter's Remorse' grace period where you may
create a new character and open a SUPPORT ticket in order to have the deleted
character restored.  Beyond this point, we will NOT restore a manually deleted
character.  If you create a new character and actively play the game with the
new character, the grace period is rendered void. 
Be aware that the nature of the deletion will also play a part in whether the
character is restored - accidentally choosing 'Delete Character' and somehow
confirming twice is one thing.  Screaming over the comm that you hate everyone
and are going to go help the Outsiders exterminate humanity before deleting is
another.
To play a character different to your current one, you MUST delete your current
character.  Multiple accounts are against policy as stated in Policy 9, and
there is no need to create a new account if a CHARACTER has been deleted. 
Accounts do NOT get deleted.
Occasionally you may TEMPORARILY be unable to delete your character - this will
always be for a specific reason: You are in a liaison role, you are active in
the middle of an ongoing plotline, you are not in a location that makes sense
for a character to 'retire' from, or you have specifically requested that we
make you unable to delete your character.
What will be restored along with your character?
When a character is restored, all points they had at the point of deletion will
also be restored, as will any credits they had on them at that point.
However, items are usually unrecoverable and cannot be returned to you - the
character will most likely be naked and have no containers.  Any clothing,
books, workbenches, etc that they had are gone.  Any robots or other items will
likewise be gone, as will apartments.
Starships are not immediately purged upon their destruction or the deletion of a
character but ARE removed from the game world and are placed in a temporary
'limbo'. After a grace period any starship in this location will be deleted.  If
the restoration of the character occurs before the next starship recycling,
there is a POSSIBILITY that any ships previously owned by that player can be
restored.  If it is after the starship recycling period, the character's ships
will be gone forever.
This is why an idle-purged character that was relatively new will often not be
restored, as without ships or items it becomes very difficult for a 'new'
character to play the game.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small blue insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a

Lillian says to Akemi in an Old Earth accent, "Am I editing for content or
grammar?"
Melinda says to Lillian, "Probably whatever you notice. I didn't do grammar."
Akemi says to Lillian, "Yes, whatever mistakes you notice or phrases that seem
to be needed which aren't in there."
Lillian Hudson says, OOCly, "Oh food's ready. I'm bad with this timing thing."
"Although I like the initiative, and appreciate the amount of work that went
into this book, I am not so sure people will use this," Kim says. "I guess it's
handy in emergency situations or to pass something confidential along. But I
don't know many pilots who have it in them to reference a code book for
everything they wanna send."

Akemi says to Kim in a Japanese accent, "As for secrecy or security, it's not."
Kim says to Akemi in a New Bristol accent, "I just didn't want you to get
disappointed. I have gone over your book and your attention to detail and system
is impressive and must have taken tons of time."
"I work on things a little at a time," says Akemi in a Japanese accent, "until
they're close enough to done for me to do something with."
Kim says to Akemi, "Well, people who don't have your book will have no clue what
it means. That is slightly more secure than just saying what you mean outright."
Sakura grins.
Akemi says to Kim in a Japanese accent, "My plan is to leave a copy at the QE
chamber, send a copy to Mister Barnoble, put it on the market for cheap, and
send a copy to all the people I know have QE comms on ships."
Kim nods. "That is a good idea."
Akemi says, "Ideally it'll just be another reference that's sitting around with
the photoalbums and entertaining books in observation decks and control rooms."
Kim says in a New Bristol accent, "I do like the codes for indicating how long a
message will take to send.But I seriously hope we won't see many messages long
enough to take 20 hours."
"It's not just the codes," says Kim, "but also the great variety of
contingencies you've come up with that most people would not think about and
that probably have not happened on expeditions yet."
A Tardick lizard named Isis curls its tail loosely around Lillian Hudson's neck.
"I'm sure there's plenty that will happen in the future and leave us going
'damn, why isn't that in here?" Akemi asks. "It's obvious!'"
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Kim nods. "Yeah, if we could forsee everything that is gonna happen on these

"That's for sure," says Zandria.
"She's my first pet, so really can't compare," Kim says.
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "If I can breed a good color
feathered felo... but I don't want orange. dark or light orange I'd take, or
silver. but not orange, and not yellow."

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small blue insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a

A tiny star remnant floats here. Having kept its angular momentum as it
collapsed, it now rotates incredibly quickly, completing a revolution every one
or two seconds. Beams of radiation blast out from its magnetic axis, creating a
pulse of high-energy electromagnetic power every time they sweep over the ship.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
"Now this trip has earned me at least 2 bilion and then some," Kim says.
Melinda applauds sedately.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

We traveled approximately 7 ltc from Planetary System 8611-8765 on a heading of
0 15 when the rift drive broke on us and we were thrown out of the flow. After a
quick repair we continued our journey on the same heading as before.

After having traveled 10.92 ltc from where we last repaired the drive on heading
0 15, we spotted Pulsar 8164-9195 at roughly 3 LGC away. akemi navigated the
ship to it.
Luminosity was very dim and there was no debris. we took a picture and did
manage to find 1 planet.
also worth noting is that we are now in what is labeled unknown space. we
changed our heading to 135 15 so we can go with the flow for a while,

We traveled 10.13 LTC between Pre-Stellar Object 2114-9398 and the point where
we spotted Planetary System 5813-8638, at 3.98 LGC East Southeast and slightly
up. this distance is not very precise due to various heading changes we made to
navigate through a storm. I flew the ship to the planetary system.
We found 1 chunk per sector, what we saw was grade 30. Luminosity was slightly
greater than sol-equivalent. After taking an image we started the scan, 2
planets were found in this system.
We are out of range from the torus extra long NDB, and are now traveling on a
heading of 90 15.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small blue insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a
bottle of peach schnapps, a bottle of expensive cognac, a clear plastic food
storage container, a white time meter, Kosmo the humanoid service robot, a cream

here."

riftstorms. That was too hard."
Melinda says to Lillian, "Did you take the soap out of the shower that is
outside our quarters?"
Lillian says to Melinda, "Nope."
Lillian says to Melinda, "Did you lose it?"
Melinda says to Lillian, "Somebody did. I had to go get in another shower. And
that was not hard, it was fun."
Lillian says to Melinda, "Yeah, because you weren't the one with weak legs at
the end of it."
Lillian giggles.
Melinda laughs.
Michael says in a Candelaria accent, "Well then."
Michael grins.
Melinda says to Lillian, "Whiner."
Lillian says to Melinda, "Oh? We'll see how you feel at the end of something
similar."
Melinda laughs.
A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which
hold it together.
Lillian turns to the rift control board and says, "Okay ship, I need a favor.
Can you fly us into a riftstorm? I need to show Melinda a new technique.
Melinda whistles.
Michael laughs.
Lillian pats the rift control board lightly.
"We Strive to Live in Peace, let's go find us a nice long riftstorm to fly
through," Lillian says. "I may need a bit of time, just to make things really
fun. I believe in you. Find us a good riftstorm.'"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

Melinda says to Michael, "So, the most important thing to remember, showers are
fun."

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.

wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a

So, a short time after leaving the Pulsar, Shule and I used the water pistols
once on each other. This is something we've done on ships a few times. However,
this time, a panel exploded in the control room and zapped us with electrisity.
I have advised, no more pistols in control rooms since we cannot be certain that
the water was not the cause.

Subject: Returning home
Author: Akemi Bando

Given that something exploded in one of the control panels and gave everyone in
the control room a nasty shock, we are returning home. It's a very poor idea to
carry on with parts malfunctioning.
This is going to be a sprint home. I don't want to stop for anything if we can
help it.

l aquarium
a large bubbling luminescent peach-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange
aquatic life and gold round rocks
This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is open.
Inside it you see a small plastic statue of a topless mermaid, a plastic wrecked
Buran-class rift galleon, and a small plastic statue of a Jinu.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A medium-sized orange creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with long
spines, a large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short
spines, a medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped
tentacles, a short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles,
a perfectly proportioned orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped
tentacles, a long eel-like creature with dark blue bioluminescence, a long
eel-like creature with crimson bioluminescence, a short yellow soft-bodied
creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a large soft yellow many-footed
creature with a yellow spherical shell, a medium-sized soft blue many-footed
creature with a black spherical shell, and a medium-sized soft blue many-footed
creature with a yellow spherical shell are living in it.
That's eleven creatures, and the tank could probably safely hold four more.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Anfisa checked our position. We're 145 LTC from home. It's southwest and
slightly down from our present position. Provided things go well, we should be
home in four or five days.
This amounts to cutting the trip short by a day. It's not ideal, but it's not a
huge loss either. We accomplished the goals we set out to do when we left: we
reached unknown space and we found some new things. I call that a success. We're
just not getting the very most we could have gotten.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
She is wearing a calf-length chemise of sheer sapphire blue silk with soft
ruffles at the neck and hem.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

worried here, Simon still can't seem to move."

less than 10 minutes ago."

sleeping."

was and still am really worried."

You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.
