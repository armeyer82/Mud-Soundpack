Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a white four poster rattan bed
with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small
seashell pink trash can, a dusky pink rattan cabinet, and a pair of shiny
buttercup yellow patent leather clogs here.
You can go out.

Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very

The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a
brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, Hugglepuff the little calico

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light yellow shipsuit with yellow trim around the collar and
cuffs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head,
face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the
Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, William Dove!
Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I sprayed air freshener in their garage.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Weapons Room Four]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
Lillian Hudson is standing here.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a temporary wormhole drive here.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 19 September 2316 GST. Time remaining: 1

I keep a single tug of felo. That works out to about 12 animals, give or take a
couple depending on where in their life cycle they are. It has the advantage of
keeping the soldier expression, which is triggered by exposure to bari-flesh for
the line, mostly active in the line since the kittens get some of the benefit of
their donor's previous exposure when a donor returns to the nest. That can get
dilluted greatly in bigger felo herds.

Yeah, first off, if you want to keep felo, please take care of them. There is no
need to hoard felo either. Enough sufficient to kill bari is all that one needs
if they can't afford to feed more than a shipful. Letting them starve to death
senselessly is abject cruelty. Take them to the Sanctuary on Hyperion if you
can't manage them.

Owners of cargo hauler Shangri-la Terraform Group 780 and cargo hauler Virgin
Olive Oil, your ships smell of decay in garage of Old Earth. Take care of this
and probably consider not owning felo if you cannot feed them.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Os%YB6(BpI~BM|!7:NwvQ&]m}^<Lvi{\jn9oN[6C
Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hey

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small neon purple
flowers, a pair of blue low rise denim jeans, and a pair of baby blue leather
clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on
her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and
waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Lily Kaise presses a button to deploy the ship's anchor.
A sharp crack is heard throughout the ship as the anchors on either side deploy
with explosive force, biting deep into the surface of the asteroid.
The ship's engines fire, and the anchored asteroid gradually begins to move
toward AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.
The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately one sector from its
destination.
Lily Kaise sits down on a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a
large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and

Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Beta 287. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yay at least flow is more in favor."
967,820.57 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

communications range.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "But if I get that, I would
need to buy horrible expensive imager."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox giggles.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's not like you don't know
people who can make them cheaper."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "This is true."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Like, Melinda, Ather, Anfisa,
Pierre, Nissi, myself..."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I would need many things for
it."
[General Communication] Nicolette of None transmits, "Who put the imager up
there? I thought it was probably Ather."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Lies."
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Akemi, how much do you charge
for imagers? I'm far from being able to use one, but..."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Mostly lenses."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "It wasn't."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "How much is it going for?
Soraya and I were skimming when you guys were talking about it earlier."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The lenses are the big problem.
I'd probably charge 1.5 billion for one if I had to build it with all my own
parts."
Listen. You need to be careful.
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "3 billion."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "... yeowch."
[General Communication] Nicolette of None transmits, "I should go buy it, just
because I can."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How many lenses does it take?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Where do you get application
for one?"
[General Communication] Nicolette of None transmits, "But I will not."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "3 billion is a bit high, but
it's not really outragoues."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "6."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "For the long-range sightseers?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Ixtapa."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Ixtapa."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Outrageous would be, like 5
billion for it."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Or Luna, if you're feeling less
adventurous."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I can buy lots of them at that
price but there are certain things I won't do."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Less adventurous."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Most people are selling lenses
in the 250 million range right now."
[Notification from Starseekers] An asteroid has been received at AEU Asteroid
Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Silver
Centaur". The organization has earned 885,663.59 credits and 2 megacredits.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yup. Meaning I could make some
cash if I really wanted to. I'll hold on to them though, since I"m getting close
to my 3000 industry."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is not that I cannot
afford, I easily can."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The rest of the parts for the
imager are almost incidental. A power source and some microchips."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "When inflation is that high, I
tend to wait for what I want at a better price. Just saying..."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I tend to be lazy."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "And buy things I want
immediately."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Probably comes from living
life where that was not possibility for me."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I generally balance how soon I
really need it with how much cash I really want to throw out there."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well do more nests and hopefully
you will encounter some Ifs where there are lenses. The Imager only requires 6."
[General Communication] Nicolette of None transmits, "I don't even want anything
right now. Or at least not anything that can be purchased with credits. I've got
all I set out to get when I started."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I am wondering if we should even
be engaging the IFS when they turn up at decoy beacons."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If they invade, sure, defend
things."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Why's that?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They sure seem to like Luna a
lot."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "..[they really do like Luna."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If we want to ever open a line
of communication with them, we should be trying t} show them that we're not
interested in fighting them at every turn."
[General Communication] Soraya Rhyz transmits, "Luna is the best. Though I don't
really like$that the IFS thinks that too."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Ahhh."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well we sort of have to if they
deploy a FAS and access to a planet or other of our resources is hampered."
[General Communication] Nicolette of None transmits, "They generally engage on
sight, they don't give you a lot of chance to think about it."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They turn up at a decoy beacon,
we can tell them "Oh we wanted Outsiders" and then move out of the sector until
they get bored and go home."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Do we have any way of
communicating with them, short of using the tools in a first contact kit?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The message is pretty clear if
you just run off from them."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "They've transmitted text in
plain Esperanto before, so they might have some means of interpreting it."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "That could send the message we're
afraid, come attack at will."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or, that could send the
message we're afraid, come attack at will."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Granted, they might've just
intercepted our SURRENDER NOW signals and were using them."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Last time I remember was...
when the Chronos showed up and wrecked like, four cruisers."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "We could send "GREETINGS" "WHERE
ARE YOU BOUND?""
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The IFS were an enemy the
Outsiders pointed humanity at."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "We should be trying to not fight
people the Outsiders want us to fight."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh, I agree. And we've had
this discussion before at some point, but I don't think simply leaving the
sector gives the right message. I don't know what the answer is, but I don't
know that that's it."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Not blowing up ships they could
be using to bother the Outsiders with is probably a good starting point."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We'd need to come to a
concensus on that, and they might simply take it as 'they're afraid of us!' and
try to do a larger scale invasion again."
[Tactical Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Anything beyond speculation
probably shouldn't be done on General, though."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The message boards are fairly
secure."

let ou know."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I was hauling out in 288."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "You've got nice flow back, if
the chatter's right."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or we were but someone fell
asleep."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So yeah, something like 18-ish
then. Well, hmm."
[General Communication] "Poor Shule. You were working him silly!" Morris Corlew
laughs.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So far have traveled 16.55
Light-years with two minutes or so to go."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, thanks, Lily."
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

responding to communications because the pirates attacked it first."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Could be it is confused. And
then you shot it."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Didn't think of that until
now."

humans as humans, and humans attacked it, even if they're pirates and not us."

off."

say this on general, but this was eerie. Right as this started, the mothership
riftscape started. Right as it ended, the mothership riftscape ended. Take that
for what you do."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "I wasn't sure. The fight had
moved away from the gem."

Testudinidae."

Keegan."

time that fight was spotted."

Minor Change: Fixed an issue where Testudinidae and Children of the Sun ships
had the same appearance on visual scans.
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "About 06:35."

was being weird. Right as that whole thing started, the mothership riftscape
started. When it ended, that riftscape ended."

but...I'm currently going 440 lm/s."

getting Up and Slightly Eastsoutheast...didn't feel like trying to estimate and
steer into it."
[General Communication] Nicolette of None transmits, "It's something like 0,
15."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, thanks. Wonder why I'm
getting that direction from my sensors then...because that'd be something like
350 65 or something similar. But if 0 15 will get me there without tooling
around, I'll use that."

we'll work on what he'd like to. Of course those things will be in there,
Morris."

back if you want a gunner. Maybe."

terrible habit of never sleeping."

gun for you."

where I'll go days without sleeping, but when I do sleep it's for insane amounts

a book and this stuffed cat and sleep. But I've a few things that need sorting
out first."

not been able to."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a white four poster rattan bed
with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,

the surrounding mountains and other Chetumalian scenery. Comfortable couches are
spaced in neat clusters for pilots to sit in as they socialize and are brought
refreshments by the attractive waitresses. Scattered close to the groups of
couches are multiple holovids tuned to the latest news, captions scrolling
around the edges. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and

and stores thrive, though often with reduced inventories due to the interruption
in trade caused by the war. Carts and tented merchants line the sidewalks, and
people mill about, searching for the perfect buy. Off to one side is The Silk
Worm, a fashionable ladies' department store. You also see a Chinese buffet bar
called the Golden Dragon, on the other side of the street. You can barely make

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making
various changes to your liking.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I am not yet at 3000
industry to get full benefit."
With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "This is a tragedy."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "One that only dedication to the
cause of performing boring and monotonous industry activities can remedy."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Or time, if you pay your 'roid
management employees."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gasp me 'Boring
and....monotonous?!?!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew bursts into a mad fit of gasps.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Boring?! Monotonous?!"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I pay my employees timely."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Those should be your nicknames,
Morris."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "They should appreciate this
and work harder."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Wait, you have to pay
employees?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Hello Notdead Morris."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Haven't seen you in a bit!"
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Not Morris? That could be
anyone."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He said not-dead..."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, ".. damnation, last names."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris laughs.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "You, Seneca!"
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "How goes Keegan?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Morris, change your name."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Be like, Fred."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We don't have any Freds."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Or Bob Joe."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I happen to like my name."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We already have a Bob, but we
don't have a Bob Joe."
[General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "You can always
just call me Moose."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Your name being Morris means I
can't change Seneca's first name at will and have her still realize I'm talking
about her."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz sighs.
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Keegan... I thinks you're
overthinking things..."
[General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "I will assume that
if you change the first name, you are referring to her. If you change my first
name to something else and call me whatever Corlew, then...we will all know you
are speaking to or of me."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Shhhh, you immediately
realizing I was talking about you detracts from my argument for Morris changing
his name, Seneca."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm just going to say "Hey you!"
from now on."
[General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "Just don't do that
if something's about to fall on me. Then I won't know who the hey you is and
might not realize something is about to fall on me."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I wish I had fancy name with
animal in it."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Oh, wait."
[General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew cheers for Aisling the Fox!
[General Communication] Mandy Sinclair laughs.
[General Communication] Mandy Sinclair transmits, "No I have not seen him around
I hope he is ok."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport cackles!
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I don't have a space ermine
title, this is a tragedy."
[General Communication] Mandy Sinclair transmits, "So what is everyone doing."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Drinking coffee."
[General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "Sitting in my
office."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "What every normal person
should be doing."
[General Communication] Mandy Sinclair transmits, "Awesome."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "After having to wash up
because somebody stamped me, nothing."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Coffee? More like watered down
strut oil."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Sitting in my ship reading and
cuddling this stuffed animal."
[General Communication] Industrial Whip Morris Corlew transmits, "What's that,
Seneca? I aspire to be normal. Maybe."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Blah."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Drink more coffee."
[General Communication] Industrial Whip Morris Corlew transmits, "So, if I drink
more coffee, I will obtain normalcy?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You will probably not."
[General Communication] Mandy Sinclair transmits, "Wow."
[General Communication] Seneca Morris transmits, "Well, you can try, but I doubt
it."
[General Communication] Industrial Whip Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Industrial Whip Morris Corlew transmits, "It would
likely take much more than coffee, unfortunately. Oh well. Sometimes not quite
normal is the best thing to be."

[Starship "Blanche Schroeder"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Ixtapa; City Apex]
You stand at the apex of Ixtapa, a city of cement ramps and plasteel towers,
with a greater height than width. The rails along the edge of the hexagonal apex
form a rather inadequate windbreak, and the force of the wind continually pushes
you against other people and into various immobile objects. Teenagers accelerate
past you on reactionless footjets, braking abruptly in front of stores or
apartments, or skimming at reckless speeds down ramps leading to lower levels. A
section of missing rail to the east turns out, upon careful examination, to lead
to a steep ramp.

[Suborbital Pod: Ixtapa to Chetumal City]
You can go nowhere.
As soon as you board the pod, it launches from the station, beginning a long arc
above the surface.
The suborbital pod reaches the top of its arc, coming to a gradual stop before
beginning to plummet back to the surface.

[Chetumal; Suborbital Pod System]
The suborbital pod station rivals the spaceport as the busiest location on the
planet. Although your status as a pilot provides you with a rather limited
travel pass, millions of other citizens are passing through here daily on their
way to any one of the planet's cities. A large yellow sign on the wall reads,
'TRANSPORT!'

In the midst of heavy construction going on around the perimeter of this large
cavern to expand and reinforce it, cargo trucks rumble down the road from the
spaceport exit to the east, lining up to wait their turn to load and unload
cargo at the long docks at the west end of the facility. The road is freshly
laid asphalt, and the old, crumbling docks have been recently replaced with more
modern equipment, including machines to automate the cargo transfer process and
computer consoles to keep track of it. Off to the side, a walkway lined with
concrete barriers provides safe passage for pedestrians.

[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a
brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, Ripper the orange felo,
Hugglepuff the little calico CatBot, and Iru the little black CatBot here.

Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a
brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, Hugglepuff the little calico

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a crisp coral pink cotton shirt with puffed sleeves, a pair of
body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue and coral pink
jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, and a pair of sparkly white
leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, waist, and both ankles are left uncovered.

[Nouveau Quebec; Access Corridor]
Beneath the bright chandelier-like lamps hanging from the apex of the ceiling of
this long, broad corridor, people of all sorts come and go, some pausing to read
one of the many colorful notices plastered across the gray metal walls. Along
the corridor are a number of doorways, several of them evidently leading to
areas of some importance, judging by the decorative metal designs around them.
The bright lights of the docking bay are visible some distance to the south,
while just to the north is a large open area full of noise and light.

[Nouveau Quebec; Independence Plaza]
Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this
spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight
sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the
blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging
mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In
the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant
fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal
statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the
north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller,
somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au
Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique
des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window,
where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'
