Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a small seashell pink
trash can, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy
sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and a
turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and a glass-covered top here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

Subject: Is there a way to know if this is ic or ooc?
Author: usfolks
Posted: Sun Jun 26 14:23:18 2016 UTC

Ok, so...I'm out of comms, so don't know if this is happening on all the comms
or just Newbie, which is the only one I have access to right now. I've heard
some people talking to someone on there, but I don't hear that person's message.
Also, a thread has disappeared from the ooc board completely. I can definitely
think of an IC reason for this, but have no way of finding out, since, as I
said, I'm out of comms. Also, I don't know if I'm the only one affected. Not
that I don't apprecieate it, because I do...but I'm just curious if there is a
way to know if there's an IC reason. Because the only boards and comm I have
access to are OOC, I can't just ask the people I'm with if they're having the
same thing happen.
Thanks.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a neon pink vibro-baton. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,
both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms,
both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both
calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a neon pink vibro-baton. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,
both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms,
both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both
calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You can go north.
A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a

peer n

[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go east and south.

the magic of topology, this intersection of two things actually creates four
equally exciting paths!

(Mutuality Jack-of-all-Trades) here.

amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Good Day AEU! Old Frontier Processor in
Frontier Cluster is once again cleansed of bari. Unfortunately, we couldn't get
a crew together until now. There should be a little over a day left before we'll
need to cleanse again. In the meantime, enjoy the best Asteroid Mining available
to AEU pilots. There are great beverages from Invader's Star Lounge as well.
Happy mining as those credits mount up! Last, this will be my last announcement

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a crisp coral pink cotton shirt with puffed sleeves, a pair of
body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue and coral pink
jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, and a pair of sparkly white
leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, a neon pink vibro-baton, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her

From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera pans slowly over a blue
air foam bed. This bed, designed for use in starships, is molded with slightly
raised sides to form a semi-enclosed space for the sleeper, preventing roll-outs
from unexpectedly hard landings, oblique take-offs, or turbulent wormhole jumps.
The bed ensures a comfortable cycle's sleep as the air foam cushions the body
but quickly resumes its original shape once pressure is removed.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

help pose

Star Conquest Help: POSE Command
--
Category: Communication
--
The POSE command is similar to EMOTE in that it helps you depict your
character's body language. Unlike an emote, however, a pose lasts until you
cancel it, and anyone entering or looking at the room will see your current
pose. This pose will also show up if someone takes your photograph.
In the same way that SIT CHAIR will depict your character sitting in a chair,
using a pose will depict your character in a certain way until you change it.
You may want your character leaning against a wall, or eyeing everyone who
enters the room, or working on a sketch. Anything that makes sense for your
character is fair game!
To use the command, simply type POSE. It will present you with a list of preset
options. You may also choose to write a custom pose by choosing option #1 from
the menu.
You can also set your pose in one command, simply by typing POSE followed by
whatever you would like your pose to be. You can cancel your pose quickly by
typing POSE CANCEL. If your pose involves sitting or lying down, standing up
will cancel it automatically.
Keep in mind that all poses are in the form of "[name] is [doing a pose]." So,
for example:
Right: pose leaning against the wall.
What Others See: Jim is leaning against the wall.
Wrong: pose leans against the wall.
What Others See: Jim is leans against the wall.

help emote

Star Conquest Help: EMOTE Command

Category: Communication

Beyond simple talking is emoting: describing your character's body language and
actions. To emote an action, use either EMOTE, : (colon) or the letter "a" to
preface what you want your character to do.
Example: EMOTE dances!
Example: :dances!
Example: a dances!
Result: Barbara Josef dances!
A more detailed emoting help file is also available by typing HELP ADVANCED
EMOTING.
Note that emoting should not be used to trick people (for example, making
someone think you've given them money) or to do things that are impossible or
inconsistent with your character (like leaping ten feet into the air and
performing five perfect backflips on the way down). Doing anything like this is
out of character.

Star Conquest Help: Advanced Emoting
--
Category: Communication
--
This document describes the more advanced syntax of emoting, also known as
'posing.' Star Conquest provides many basic socials, such as 'nod' or 'laugh,'
but we also offer a rich emote system, where one can specify players and other
objects in the world directly, so that they will see 'you' instead of their
name.
For example, you could emote the following:
emote stares at ~kailyn for a moment before pointing a finger triumphantly in
the air.
:stares at ~kailyn for a moment before pointing a finger triumphantly in the
air.
Other players would see something like this:
Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein stares at Kailyn Sanas for a moment before
pointing a finger triumphantly in the air.
Kailyn, in this case would see:
Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein stares at you for a moment before pointing a
finger triumphantly in the air.
Additionally, you can passively emote, like so:
emote Suddenly, @ jumps into the air, cheering.
:Suddenly, @ jumps into the air, cheering.
Other players would see this:
Suddenly, Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein jumps into the air, cheering.
You can even combine the two, like so:
emote Bullets of sweat drip down @'s face while ~elena speaks.
:Bullets of sweat drip down @'s face while ~elena speaks.
Other players would see:
Bullets of sweat drip down Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein's face while Elena
Gibson speaks.
Additionally, one can use :: to eliminate the space after the emote, like so.
::'s metafrequency communicator warbles to life.
Everyone would then see:
Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein's metafrequency communicator warbles to life.
You can use ~ multiple times in an emote, as well:
emote gesticulates wildly at ~jason, ~elena, and ~kailyn.
:gesticulates wildly at ~jason, ~elena, and ~kailyn.
The results of which is left as an exercise to the reader.
When you begin using emotes with more than just two people in the room, frequent
usages of ~person and ~person's or ~object can start to get a little old, as
well as sometimes confusing. To improve this, we've added pronoun modifiers.
Of the five modifiers, the three you'll most be using is .o, .p, and .q, running
off the same previous system of ~person, (tilde person), by adding .letter (dot
letter) to the end. This also works for object referral. Remember that you'll
always want to start an emote by referencing the person without a modifier, so
the room at large knows who you're emoting, because the modifiers will reduce
the others to only seeing 'her/him/its', and without the initial ~person they
won't know who is being emoted.
o for object pronoun. "Him, her, it," to others in the room and the person using
the emote. You to the person the emote is referencing. ~person.o. Emoter: (her)
Emoted (you) Third party (her)
p for possessive pronoun (adj). "His, her, its," to the room and person emoting,
your to the person referenced. ~person.p. Emoter: (his) Emoted (your) Third
party (his)
q for possessive pronoun (noun). "His, hers, its," to the room and the person
emoting, yours to the person referenced. ~person.q. Emoter: (her) Emoted (yours)
Third party (hers)
Example:
:emotes ~kailyn, swinging ~kailyn.o around by ~kailyn.p arm, his fingers twining
in ~kailyn.q.
The person sending the emote(Shadow here, but you normally), would see:
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow emotes Kailyn Sanas, swinging her around by her
arm, his fingers twining in hers.
And for the person being referenced (Kailyn) would see
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow emotes you, swinging you around by your arm,
his fingers twining in yours.
And the room at large would see
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow emotes Kailyn Sanas, swinging her around by her
arm, his fingers twining in hers.
Remember objects can be manipulated too, or even creative use on people.
:manipulates ~scanner to scan ~scan.r.
The person sending the emote would see:
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow manipulates a small hand scanner to scan
itself.
The hand scanner wouldn't see anything, because it's just a sad little hand
scanner. Poor thing. If it could see, it would be
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow manipulates you to scan yourself.
Others in the room would see the same output as the emoter. Their output is
usually similar to the emoter, but there are times it will be slightly
different. Don't get discouraged, test it out for a better roleplaying
environment and a lot more fun socially!
Some clients may parse certain ascii keys in different ways, either needing an
extra tilde, comma, at sign, or colon. Experimentation with others is always
useful, pull someone you're comfortable with aside and have them show you their
side of the output, until you get the hang of it and know how things will look
for other people.
Full listing:
 Pronouns:
        .s => subject pronoun:          either `he',  `she', or `it'
        .o => object pronoun:           either `him', `her', or `it'
        .p => possessive pronoun (adj):  either `his', `her', or `its'
        .q => possessive pronoun (noun): either `his', `hers', or `its'
        .r => reflexive pronoun:  either `himself', `herself', or `itself'
