00:41 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on you) here.

01:25 ["Pale Blue Dream" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

01:26 Blotto Hendrix's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I like a ship with no seatbelts. if they're there, I feel obligated to put them on, but they impair my drinking arm. if they're not there, its not my fault they aren't there"

01:26 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:26 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:27 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:27 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:27 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:27 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:27 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:27 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:03 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the five-person transverser "Curious Creature" powered down here.
You see the five-person transverser "Star Liner", the five-person transverser "Celestial Siren", and the one-person expediter "Flying Cat" landed here.

03:04 You're already sitting down.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

03:04 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

03:04 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:04 The one-person expediter "Flying Cat" has left the sector.

03:04 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

03:04 The ship is already moving.

03:05 The ship is already moving.

03:05 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:05 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

03:05 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

03:05 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:05 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

03:05 Current coordinates: 5, 16, 10

03:05 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:05 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

03:05 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:05 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

03:05 You can't go that way.

03:05 You can't go that way.

03:05 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

03:05 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

03:05 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:05 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

03:05 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

03:05 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:05 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:05 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:05 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:05 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

03:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

03:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several
07:09  shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

07:18 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Is there a way to see how much damage my ship can take?

07:18 [Newbie] Anny Rain: I think,no.

07:18 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Type damage.

07:18 [Newbie] Anara Webster: It just says there are no damaged components.

07:19 [Newbie] Jack West: Your ship gets hit, once it gets hit you can see the damage report, once your hull gets to 100 you will blow up.

07:19 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Then there's no need to worry. There's no real way to see how much damage a ship can take as too many variables would be involved...or, what he said.

07:20 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Also, when does this newbie channel warning thing stop?

07:20 [Newbie] Keao Malama: That's what I was wondering too.

07:20 [Newbie] Jack West: It is useful to note that the more components, usually weapons, the more damage your ship can take, you can also get the hull reinforcement.
