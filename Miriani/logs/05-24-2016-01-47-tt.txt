Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated
green cooler, a white microwave oven, and a clear plastic food storage container
here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a large leather couch. Rogue Romano, Blake Madison, Joel
Kringle, Lillian Hudson, and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a large leather
couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a large leather couch.)
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Storms, webs and
showers."
