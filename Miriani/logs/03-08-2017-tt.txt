-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple
and amethyst flower quilt, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a pair of
gray canvas sneakers, and a pair of tan suede clogs here.
You can go out.

My last spot just filled up. Thank you everyone who showed interest, and if
someone can't make it for any reason, you will get preference!
All future updates will be on the ship board as to not clutter this one. Crew
members should feel free to check occasionally.
If you have any questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to give me a call.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

coffee table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small

yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, a

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole

Brianna O'Banyon
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and very large breasts. Her face is
heart-shaped and lovely, with a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are
pouty and applied with creamy petal pink lipstick, and occasionally part to
reveal a set of white teeth. Subtle petal pink blush is applied to her cheeks.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are leaf green and slanted, and
enhanced with softly smudged silver eyeliner and shimmering silver eyeshadow.
She has subtle black mascara. Her waist-length, very curly hair is ebony and
swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has long painted
shimmering ruby fingernails. She has a sprinkling of tiny silver stars in her
hair.
 She is wearing a leaf green lace camisole, a delicate chain of tiny amber beads
and clear crystals with silver bead accents around her waist, a pair of short
butt-hugging dark green jean shorts with amethyst and plum pink jeweled
handprints on the back pockets, and a pair of deep green thong sandals decorated
with bouquets of tiny embroidered flowers. She is also wearing a rosebud pink
touch einrophone in a rosebud pink reinforced plastic phone holster, a pair of
earrings with delicate amber crescent moons suspended from tiny silver studs, a
small white silk purse, and a bracelet of purple amethyst crystals intertwined
with delicately knotted silver wire. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both
shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.
