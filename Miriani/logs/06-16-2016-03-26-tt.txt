Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Sheets of tinted glass form a transparent window into the outside world around
this crescent-shaped lounge, giving you a clear view to both the landing pad and
the surrounding mountains and other Chetumalian scenery. Comfortable couches are
spaced in neat clusters for pilots to sit in as they socialize and are brought
refreshments by the attractive waitresses. Scattered close to the groups of
couches are multiple holovids tuned to the latest news, captions scrolling
around the edges. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and
bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a gleaming granite-topped bar, a public holovid, and a brightly-lit
candy vending machine here.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 303" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash
can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I must also buy the computer

shrug 'Guess not.
You shrug. "Guess not."
You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person light
transport "Registered Merchant 303" lift off of the landing pad and ascend into
space.

you, Lily, it'd just be three.

Your normal bubble travels will be fixed between now and a few days. We have
replaced the passive beacon but there may be a conflict with the marker beacon.
So, we may have to wait till it sorts itself out. Also, we will be combining the
xeno and salvage stations out at the belt of Orion in a few days. This will mean
that we will be dumping salvage into the furnace to maintain the station on a
daily basis. So, I hope that pilots don't mind helping out with that while they
earn a few credits.
If you have any questions, complaints or whatever, give me a shout.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair, a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow
bowl, and Maria Mitchell the humanoid service robot here.

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with the phrase

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array." here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a small seashell pink
trash can, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and a glass-covered
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy sapphire blue
ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a
pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, a pair of leather thong sandals with
a white flowered print, and Xavier the big silver soldier felo here.
You can go out.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a clear camera with a saucy
strap, a sturdy navy blue canvas AEU backpack, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.

Subject: Big Octarine Hummer Felo - Would make a good pet
Author: Lily Kaise
Posted: 14:27 16 June 2316 GST
--
a big octarine felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, spotted octarine fur,
possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, average legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked yellow claws
visible. A orange, vertical nose sits below a pair of clear indigo eyes with
horizontal pupils.
Just let me know and we can make arrangements for you to get it.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a small seashell pink
trash can, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and a glass-covered
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy sapphire blue
ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a
pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of leather thong sandals
with a white flowered print here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I really wouldn't want to give it to her

anything which exceeds 500 thousand credits."
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I wish there was some way
for me to know the rift conditions before I went to 134..."

in orion?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Why can't she just buy the
tonic herself?"

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, and Zeala the small yellow cyclops felo
kitten here.
Lily Kaise, Evenia Callseah, and Ted Warburton are standing here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

THE BARI
Very few life forms are known to exist in the vacuum of space.  From the
apocryphal 'asteroid dog' to the mythical 'space whale', hard facts are rare
while tall tales are the rule of thumb.  And then there are the Bari.
First encountered by humanity in 2299, the Bari are spaceborn insectoid alien
life forms of rudimentary intelligence.  In space, they appear to enter a form
of biochemical hibernation until they sense anything capable of feeding them,
like a starship.
Many pilots have made the mistake of assuming that the Bari themselves eat
starships, but this is a misunderstanding of the ecosystem that the Bari
generate for their sustenance.
Once on a starship or other metals-rich location, the rat-sized Bari will
cultivate a fast-growing fungal mold that thrives on various forms of metal,
especially those used in the construction of human vessels.  This mold dissolves
and consumes the metals used within starship components with ease, leaving them
at first merely damaged but eventually completely destroyed.  It is also
theorised that the starship's electrical systems assist in the spread of the
mold.
Thankfully, some of the alloys in hull plating and starship chassis construction
are unpalatable to the mold.  This means that while a starship will eventually
be millimeters away from destruction, the mold itself is incapable of outright
destroying a human starship by itself.  Unfortunately many of the specialised
components require extremely tight tolerances of construction and as such the
materials used cannot be replaced with these inert alloys.
Before the Outsider Subjugation of Mankind, the Coalition of Human and Jinu had
managed to develop a form of anti-mold coating that could give temporary
protection from the Bari mold, but with the loss of the munroujuhk long-range
beacons cutting us off from Coalition Command and the subsequent loss of most
high-end research in human space this coating is currently unavailable to us,
though research into redevelopment is ongoing.
An infestation left untreated for long enough to grow will result in mature Bari
hordes constructing large cocoons, in which a small handful of the horde will
metamorphose into Bari warriors.  These bulkier insectoid beings are far larger
than their previous state, approaching the size of a baboon or chimpanzee. 
Heavily armored in a thick chitinous exoskeleton, the Bari warriors are hostile
to apparently all non-Bari forms of life.
Once again, the Coalition of Humans and Jinu had (pre-Subjugation) developed a
spray from warrior pheremones that would allow a non-Bari to temporarily slip
past Bari warriors without incident, but as with the anti-mold coating this
knowledge was lost when contact was cut with Coalition Command.
If the infestation is not destroyed, the Bari will create a highly compressed
organic object, held in place by vine-like tendrils constructed from an ichor
the Bari produce.  This object will slowly grow as the Bari hordes and warriors
tend to it, eventually filling a large portion of the ship's bowels.  When large
enough, the Bari will force it through the weakened hull of the ship and once in
the vacuum of space a complex and not yet fully understood process will begin as
the pod loses its outer shell and grows several dozen times its original size in
a matter of minutes.  
When fully expanded a pod begins to generate large numbers of drone-like
creatures that have been termed 'spreader vessels', so named due to the fact
that they spread Bari spores across a sector as they move, quickly infesting
starships in order to begin the life cycle anew.
While there are known preventative measures such as the anti-mold coating and
the Bari pheremonal spray, it is currently impossible to create either without
knowledge that is currently only located within Coalition Command in Jinu space,
if the facility still exists.
The only known threat to the Bari life forms themselves are the felinoid
creatures known as Felo, originally from the planet Grenwold but currently
infesting several other planets in their own ecological disasters.  Felo are
highly aggressive to most forms of non-mammalian life, and are even more so to
Bari.  While Bari hordes are no match for a Felo, Bari warriors will often best
them in combat, usually killing them. However, a Felo that survives an encounter
with a hostile entity like a Bari warrior will occasionally metamorphose into a
bulkier 'soldier' that will find such targets much easier to deal with.
Without cultivation from larval Bari, the mold within a starship will eventually
reach the limits of its initial growth and die off once the nearby supply of
metals has been consumed.  However in a space station if mold reaches the air
vents or filtration system them the entire station will become infested.
The only definite way to completely eradicate a Bari presence is via high-energy
plasma, which is both extremely dangerous and highly expensive.  Unregistered
and Mutuality stations often have plasma flood protocols set up due to the risk
of Bari infestation, but planetary alliance space structures do not for safety
and morale reasons.  As such, a planetary alliance space structure that is
infested must be cleared out quickly before the infestation can spread from the
original location, or it will be near-impossible to ever completely remove.
Starship weapons are suitable to destroy a spreader vessel, as the spreader must
be alive to generate spores.  Once dead, it can no longer infest others.
The most efficient method to destroy a Bari pod is to use a plasma bomb placed
as close to the core of the pod as possible before arming.  This will destroy
the pod and living bari within, as well as the majority of spores generated by
the pod.
NOTE: The more harmful aspects of Bari infestations (mold damage, warriors,
queens) will not occur aboard a starship owned by someone with Cadet status. 
This is an OOC mechanic limitation and should be ignored to the best of people's
ability.  Please also note that (as stated above) a Bari infestation will never
outright destroy a starship: even the release of a bari pod will not cause a
starship to be destroyed. While a large enough infestation may take considerable
effort to deal with, it is always possible to remove a Bari infestation and a
ship is never 'lost' to the Bari.
