03:13 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: I will love you forever Tibo]

My dearest Love,
Well it has likewise come the time for me to tell you that if you were telling me the truth all along, then you wouldn't truly be a coward that you are being and leave piloting. Yes you cheated with a cheater so you got what you truly deserved now. I hope I never find your mistress alone as now I will truly get revenge for destroying as she obviously has or you would come back to me. She has brainwashed you so horribly as well. You wer cheating on me before that night that you faked a breakup with me to try to cover yourself. You obviously had contact with her and a plan to move in. That is cheating as who knows how long and then you moved in with her in some other man's home. That is so disgusting and so disrespectful of the spirit and to the owner of the property especially if it is a boyfriend or former boyfriend.
So either come back to me and face me or be on your way Tibo Beauchene or the memory I will have of you will be only of a cheater who wouldn't admit to his wrongs, a coward who wouldn't hold himself accountable for his stupid mistakes in judgement and obviously one who couldn't encourage a decent woman like me to trust him and consumate her love with you. At least i was correct in that you would prove yourself untrustworthy.
I did offer to forgive you and to make an effort to be with you one on one to work out our differences. Cowards only run and hide behind their broken promises and lies though rather than face those whom they have hurt.
I always felt that you were hiding something and I know now that you are just a user whom i obviously couldn't resist so that is my fault for allowing it. If you weren't, you would be back in my arms. I suppose there is some remote glint of guilt on your behalf there because you are so compeled to run away and throw your career away rather than admit to your wrongs and apologize to me.
You lashed out at me for your problems too which means you still can't see through your own lack of accountability. I am the one you can trust though but it's so painful that you would blame me rather than admit it that you yourself are responsible for your failures.
it's sad for you Tibo Beauchene and my heart will miss you forever but we pilots certainly don't need another dishonest cheater amongst us women who only desire a good and honest companion. I wanted to marry you and I still do but my intuition told me I should wait and I am so right that you haven't the decency to face me.
I will say to you one last time, that the door is still open and especially for you to come back to me and prove that I am wrong. One other thing Tibo though is you are to show me that you are truly a man of integrity. You will also cease blaming me for what others do to you as well. You know Tibo,you just don't realize who your friends truly are as well and especially that I am not a cheater like Miriam Val
03:13 leris who cheted on her boyfriend to break us up. If you come back to me, I will leave her to her miserable life sleeping around with any man she wants though. She truly has the blackest heart and soul as she has no comprehension of guilt for the destruction in her path.
I will be sad forever Tibo and I may never get over it if you don't come back and at least try to work things out with me. Still, if you won't, I can't blame myself for your turning your back on me and running away to cover your wrongs.
I still love you with my heart because true love never dies.
Kitty
