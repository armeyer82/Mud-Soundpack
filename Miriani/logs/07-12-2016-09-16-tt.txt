Humanity has just emerged from the
lowest point in its collective history,
and
the closest it has been to extinction
since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and
their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought
themselves powerful. But the Outsiders,
an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of
Rimward space, proved them wrong. First
contact
between the two allies was severed, and
suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human
planets and governments fell one by
one.
                         It was the
apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many,
not all hope was lost. After five
years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell,
returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the
Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this,
and the
help of many other brave pilots, the
occupying Outsiders were driven off
human
               worlds and back to where
they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and
trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation,
and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to
appear every day. In the midst of it
all,
civilian starships span the stars,
maintaining an open threat against any
new
       invasion and trying to make a
few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the
desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to
explore, the need to defend your
species,
         and yes, greed for the vast
wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take
to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give
crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large
enough to do much else. A long counter
is bolted to the wall opposite the
entryway, and two narrow bunks have
been bolted to the two remaining walls.
A small keypad is next to the door,
controlling a simple lock. The status
lights overhead are currently not
receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at
New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small yellow ball containing
a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow
bowl, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk

"Nope. No replies to the post yet."

the other stuff you asked for."

"That's ok. How much would you charge
me for the pumps?"
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits,
"It's two autostops not 3. I was having
a moment earlier I think."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits,
"But two pumps still."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits,
"Ok, an enhanced gascious exchange pump
unit is made out of 1 medium metal
frame, 24 hydraulic piston, 32 metal
cylinders, 2 circuit boards and a
handful of metal bolts. Now the frame
and bolts and even the circuit boards
are not a problem. But I will have to
charge for the cylinders and pistons
unless you can supply them."

"And I have really no clue what their
value is."

extreme values after all, must just be
rare on my end."

each. I'd give you 25 for the 2 of
them."

knows these things."

"Ok, since you are a fellow org member
I will ask 15 milion for 2 of them,
just for the supplies."

isn't cheap, so that'll help some. I
can meet you or send you a chip, either
way."

Faraday cage that keeps out electrical
energy. Scientists and technicians walk
up and down the street, wearing

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in

Finial Avenue is a length of rather
scorched concrete lined by the series
of tall lightning rods that gives it
its name. An arching metal lattice
overhead and to either side forms a
Faraday cage that keeps out electrical
energy. Scientists and technicians walk
up and down the street, wearing
environmental suits which also act as
Faraday cages in addition to possessing
bulky cooling units. Among these people
occasionally stride even larger
figures: people in powered armor, their
suits designed both for environmental
protection and intense ground combat.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently
not receiving power. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is
in a garage.

This strange, six-legged creature is
vaguely cat-like, though its head
appears almost vulpine. It is large in
size and covered in very long, speckled
violet fur, possessing a short, sleek
tail that slowly flicks back and forth.
Its fur is a normal short length on its
legs and face, but elsewhere the fur is
very long, spreading across the ground
when it lies down and giving it a thick
fluffy tail. The felo's short, thick
legs each end in three-toed paws with

Star Conquest Help: Space Geography
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Star Conquest has a fully-realized
space system as one of its primary
features. Space is big and it can be
confusing. Sometimes intentionally! But
here are the basics.
SECTORS
Space is divided into sectors, which
are simply a way of marking off and
differentiating volumes of space.
Sectors are three-dimensional, and are
further subdivided into coordinates: 20
by 20 by 20.
Numbers! Each sector is 240,000km
across on each axis, or about 1/625th
of an astronomical unit, or about
8/10ths of a light-second. So, a
lightyear is just shy of 40 million
sectors. This would be common knowledge
among pilots.
BEACONS
A sector exists because a beacon has
been placed there broadcasting its
location. This beacon is what allows
starships to jump there using their
wormhole drive.
Beacons can be based on planets, on
space stations, or free-floating in a
beacon housing.
There are three types of beacons you'll
commonly encounter:
* Primary beacons: These are beacons
for main sectors that you can jump to
from any location (with a few
exceptions). Examples are Earthgate,
Providence Gate, or the Dusty Reaches.
These are primary thoroughfares and
also act as travel bottlenecks.
* Secondary beacons: These are used
within a sector cluster. For instance,
Old Earth Orbit and Martian Orbit are
both marked by secondary beacons. What
this means is that from another sector
cluster, you would first have to jump
to Earthgate, because that is the
primary beacon for the cluster. From
there, you can jump to Old Earth or
Mars, the secondary beacons.
* Weak beacons: These are not really a
separate category, because primary or
secondary beacons can also be weak.
Weak beacons do not broadcast over a
wide range, and generally a ship's
computer must know of its approximate
location before it can scan for a weak
beacon. Scanning will still usually
take several attempts. Weak beacons are
used in Mutuality space to help it
remain hidden.
SECURITY
Sectors also each have a security
rating describing the degree of safety
you can expect there. Check the
SECURITY RATINGS help file for more
information.
MOVING BETWEEN SECTORS
You can travel to other sectors with
your starship's JUMP command. You can
type this command by itself for a list
of accessible sectors, or you can type
JUMP [sector name] to start traveling
there immediately. For instance, JUMP
EARTHGATE will take you straight to the
Earthgate sector from most locations.
Your starship can also successfully
navigate multiple jumps. For instance,
if you're in a distant sector cluster
and you type JUMP OLD EARTH, your ship
will automatically travel first to
Earthgate and then make a second jump
to Old Earth Orbit. Linked jumps such
as these will occur faster and use less
battery charge than if you performed
the jumps individually.

Star Conquest Help: Starship Basics

Category: Beginner Information

This help file will very quickly teach
you the basics of flying a starship.
POWER: Use this command to turn your
ship's main power on and off.
LAUNCH: Use this command to get your
ship off the ground.
Once launched, there are a few ways to
get your bearings in space.
STARMAP or SM: Shows a semi-graphical
representation of your current sector.
RUNDOWN or RD: A purely text list of
nearby objects, preferred by users of
screen readers.
Moving around in a sector is easy.
MOVE: Presents you with a menu of
destinations in the sector. Choose one
and autopilot will take you there.
The MOVE command is also what you use
to land on a planet or dock at a space
station. Just select where you want to
land, and when your ship arrives, you
will be prompted whether you wish to
land.
JUMP: Use this command to jump your
ship to another sector. You can type
JUMP by itself to see a list of
sectors, or type JUMP [sector name] to
have your ship travel there
automatically.
For a full list of starship commands,
see the Starship Command Reference help
file.

thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap

Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever

boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the

stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering
Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner
and sterile than most people expect
when they first board a starship.
Though there are some exposed, thick
bundles of wires running here and
there, most of the actual workings of
the ship are deeper in its structure.
Instead, the room is virtually bare and
brightly lit, with one wall dominated
by a large graphical representation of
the ship and its components, alongside
current estimates of damage levels. On
the right is a small starmap set into a
wall, displaying a bare minimum of
information so that it is not a
distraction to the one keeping the ship
together. A simple control board allows
the operator to prioritize repairs. The
status lights overhead are currently
not receiving power. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is
in a garage.

"Critical Strike" is written along its
hull in flaming crimson letters.
The designation "AR-7C" is stamped in
tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function
with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with
protruding turrets, communications
equipment, and a box-like protrusion in
the rear where the reactionless drive
and wormhole drive reside. But, of
course, it is not intended to fly
through an atmosphere. A small
protrusion on the nose of the vessel is
its main sensor relay. Only the bottom
appears smooth, and even that is marred
by the extension of its landing struts
when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a
white color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are blackened and outlined in
silvery gray. The bays of its
minicannon launchers are clean and
painted silvery gray. Its landing
struts are clean and painted white.
It has a blue AEU logo forward on the
starboard side and a smooth dome and a
geodesic radome on the forward end.
A sanitation drone turns and slowly

The control room is the hub of every

thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap

Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.

a few others to sit or stand, the

[Starship "Vengeance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently
not receiving power. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is
in a garage.

[Starship "Flash"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on red alert. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in
space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a
wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control
Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in
space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a
black leather captain's chair, a
wormhole drive tracer, a black leather
sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control
Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is

The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship

Gunships and the Pincer:
Five-Person Gunship 65,000,000.00 (New
Earth Blazing Trails)
AM-9X AEU STAR-CLASS GUNSHIP
Requirements: 250 industry points      
100 combat points
Model number: AM-9X                    
Designation: Gunship
Turret hardpoints: 15                  
Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 32000       
Standard battery hours: 24
Docking bay size required: 60          
Docking bay capacity: 25
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
The AM-9X is the first-tier gunship of
the AEU. It is a good starter ship for
someone looking to become more
experienced with flying larger and more
dangerous decoy beacon drops without
facing some of the more challenging
vessels they are likely to encounter
using bigger or more heavily armed
ships.
Five-Person Pulsar 100,000,000.00
(Endymion)
AR-7C AEU PULSAR-CLASS ASSAULT GUNSHIP
Requirements: 1250 industry points     
1250 combat points
Model number: AR-7C                    
Designation: Pulsar
Turret hardpoints: 20                  
Launcher hardpoints: 3
Standard storage capacity: 35000       
Standard battery hours: 16
Docking bay size required: 65          
Docking bay capacity: 25
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
While this ship has less charge than
the AM-9X gunship, it's also
considerably better armed, being
outfitted with five additional turrets
and 2 additional launchers. The pulsar
can hold its own against even
cruiser-class ships if it has to, and
its hull (if you look at the status
readouts) is stronger than that of the
AM-9X.
Six-Person Pincer (approval required)
(Telex Defense Incorporated)
T6-09 TELEX DEFENSE INC. PINCER-CLASS
FORWARD ASSAULT FRIGATE
Requirements: 1500 industry points     
1500 combat points
Model number: T6-09                    
Designation: Pincer
Turret hardpoints: 17                  
Launcher hardpoints: 6
Standard storage capacity: 30000       
Standard battery hours: 12
Docking bay size required: 100         
Docking bay capacity: 37.5
   Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
Ever wanted your own frigate to do
six-person combat activities with?
Well, the pincer is your answer to this
problem! However, you will have to fill
out an application for it, and it can
take some time for you to know whether
or not you got aproved to buy the ship.
You will be notified by mail
regardless.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent
to its surroundings.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I'm thinking of putting the high
capacity low output power storage
system back on my science vessel and
taking that out somewhere I can base
from, like Andy's. Then just exploring
the area."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Head out, see what's around, turn
around and recharge, go back out
again."
grin 'Sounds fun.
You grin. "Sounds fun."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"That would be fun."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I'd also like to put a bigger effort
together to explore west of and south
from Feng Wo Station."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But that would take a bit of time."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"Is there anything in particular you're
interested in out there?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"No but you never know what we may
find..."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I sure wonder where Trdick Station
is."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Oops Tardick."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Shule has never been to Feng Wo and
I'm sure there's more star formations
and planets to be discovered."

Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I don't have a lot of business out at
Feng Wo, per se. Anfisa's been talking
about getting solar panels, whenever
she's got time for the trip. I suppose
that'd be reason enough to go. But we'd
probably just take the bolt itself for
that."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I'd also love to go to Gunarsh too as
several of haven't been."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth
accent, "Which of course is quite the
other direction!"
Lily Kaise grins.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah

Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel
FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise
transmits, "Good day!"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah
transmits, "Nemesis is okay. Hey
Demarco!"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"The Followers are nice people. I
figure the next trade group that goes
out that way will likely be sometime
next year. Seems like a yearly kind of
thing."
Lily Kaise nods.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
transmits, "That doesn't answer the
first question though. How are you?"
nod
You nod.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah
transmits, "I'm okay. Sorta gotta get a
new ship, but well."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Well don't sleep at the controls
silly."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"You heard all the details about that
last trip, I guess."
'oh, is that what happened?
You ask, "Oh, is that what happened?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I'm glad her pets survived."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls
its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's
neck.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Apparently."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"That one is probably too mean to
perish haha."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Between the people associated with
Annie's crew not telling Anfisa what
Annie had done, Syona and Tatiana's
nonsense, and the general worries about
people behaving badly when it comes to
talk about how people live and what
they believe, I get the feeling that if
there's any crew from the Metal Heart
trip involved in the next trade mission
that it will be carefully conducted."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Uh yes I should say so."
'Makes sense.
You say, "Makes sense."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,
"Well Annie had already retired so i'm
not clear what you are referring to
with regards to Annie?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But yeah Annie did totally shun me on
that trip and assigned me to take care
of the temp stations."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"When Annie's crew met the Followers,
she decided to leave in the middle of
the night after the trading was
concluded."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,
"Wow no kidding?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Instead of sticking around and saying
goodbye properly and being polite."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"That's typical of what Annie would
do."
'Why did she do a thing like that/
You ask, "Why did she do a thing like
that?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"The Followers were upset about it, and
were very politely making their
displeasure known."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Who knows, Annie did weird things all
the time."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But I'd say rather poor in terms of
being respectful towards the
followers."
'Well, I don't blame them.
You say, "Well, I don't blame them."
Lily Kaise squints.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"You don't know the half of it but
yeah."
'I'd be upset too if people just left
in the middle of the night without
saying good-bye.
You say, "I'd be upset too if people
just left in the middle of the night
without saying good-bye."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"That is why I left Starseekers."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"We made apologies and gave the
Followers gifts and smoothed things
over."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I'm glad but I hope the rest of us
aren't blamed."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Well, the Followers didn't make too
fine a distinction between regs."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
transmits, "Anybody know if the
different supply stores might sell
different paint colors?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"You well know that there are those of
us in aEU who respect the crew we are
with."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah
transmits, "They're all the same from
what I've seen."
Akemi Bando speaks into her glittery
black metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Akemi Bando
transmits, "The selection is more
limited at more remote stations. Unreg
stations often only offer a few colors,
if any."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
transmits, "Happen to know if anybody
has pearl white or some kind of
iridescent white?"
Lily says to Akemi, "I totally
respected your decisions to turn back
too. I only stated my own viewpoint but
it was your ship, your time and your
efforts and there were no hard feelings
on neither my part and I can't speak
for Shule but I feel that he thinks the
same."
Lily Kaise smiles.
smile
You smile.
Akemi Bando speaks into her glittery
black metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Akemi Bando
transmits, "I can make that. I don't
know of anyone else who sells that
color."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
transmits, "Aha...how much for a can?"
'I'm not the type to go against the
captain's decisions.
You say, "I'm not the type to go
against the captain's decisions."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Most definitely not."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I also believe it's in extreme poor
taste and disrespectful to rais debates
amongst a crew in a limited
environment."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks
its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Akemi Bando speaks into her glittery
black metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Akemi Bando
transmits, "I have to source supplies
through a chemical supply dealer that
agreed to go through the typical
paperwork for dealing directly with a
civilian pilot. It's like, 40 times as
expensive as the wholesale paints when
it's all said and done."
'Well, I think people should share
their opinions, but in doing so, they
should find a  way not to be
disrespectful.
You say, "Well, I think people should
share their opinions, but in doing so,
they should find a way not to be
disrespectful."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
transmits, "Wow, so 8 mill for a can?
You're gonna break me Akemi."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Well there are certain issues though
that I think shouldn't be raised in
that sort of environment."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
laughs.
Akemi Bando speaks into her glittery
black metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Akemi Bando
transmits, "A little more than that,
actually, but you're in the ballpark."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew
transmits, "Let me think about it.
Paint is kind of a luxury. The other
things we talked about are more
important."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Crimes against humanity would raise my
ire though."
nod lily 'Very true.
You nod to Lily Kaise. "Very true."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"As they should. I'm still not sure
what Tatiana thought she could
accomplish making that argument to that
crew."
'Yeah, I have no idea.
You say, "Yeah, I have no idea."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Uh yeah that just baffles me but I
honestly believe she was mentally
unstable."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Still it's not acceptable."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Syona, I think she had many
mis-conceptions and I sure wish she
would have consulted with Ather and
perhaps myself before she went off and
started debating certain things."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU
pilot corps liaison transmits,
"Excellent work on our first
performance goal! Let's go for the
second!"
Lily Kaise keys her metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Lily Kaise
cheers.
tra 10 cheer
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Shule
Elemmire cheers.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"One goal in at least."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I wish people hadn't taken her so
seriously when she and Syona returned
in that escape pod."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Her credibility was nil and no one
told her to stuff it until we came
back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Well I didn't after a few hours..."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I saw through the distortions."
frown 'Yeah, she pretty much hated me
after that.
You frown. "Yeah, she pretty much hated
me after that."
'not pretty much.
You say, "Not pretty much."
'She did.
You say, "She did."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"What did you do?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"That pretty much isn't true but
remember how she would twist things."
'Didn't back her story.
You say, "Didn't back her story."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Shule called me into his office and
asked me what I thought."
'After talking to Syona nad Tatiana.
You say, "After talking to Syona nad
Tatiana."
'er, Syona
You say, "Er, Syona."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Perhaps we shouldn't share
confidentialities here but I don't mind
stating my side of things."
'I mainly called Lily in because
apparently was there when Tatiana and
Syona arrived.
You say, "I mainly called Lily in
because apparently was there when
Tatiana and Syona arrived."
'er, she apparently was there when the
escape pod arrived.
You say, "Er, she apparently was there
when the escape pod arrived."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"So I told him without a doubt that I
didn't believe Tatiana's account to
hold any credibility."
'But i knew and never knew anything of
her plan to launch that beacon. Until
it was revealed over General or
whatever.
You say, "But I knew and never knew
anything of her plan to launch that
beacon. Until it was revealed over
General or whatever."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I have known members of that crew
since I became a pilot and I highly
respect everyone and so first I was
furious! That she and Syona had no
respect for them and furious because of
how they made the AEU look and many
other aspects."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But oh Akemi as for Tatiana's plan..."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Shule and I can tell you that we were
blind-sided."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits,
"I don't know if this question can be
answered or not, if not, just say
so...but when looking for things for
strangers, if they don't say they need
a certain number, is there another way
to know how many of any given item they
want?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"We had no knowledge whatsover and
nobody from League who knew about it
shared anything at all."
'If I had known, I'd have taken further
actions. I didn't do anything because I
didn't honestly  know of that insane
plan.
You say, "If I had known, I'd have
taken further actions. I didn't do
anything because I didn't honestly know
of that insane plan."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I think that Emily likely withheld it
deliberately to be political."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels
transmits, "Not unless they say
something that signifies one. Such as I
need an artifact."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks
its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Well, sure, she didn't share it until
she felt like she had a group of people
who would listen to her. But she didn't
share it until we were almost back
home. There was something like three
weeks between when that escape pod
returned and when Tatitana shared her
story, and then another week between
that and when Metal Heart returned."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits,
"Well they said they need stuff from
three different things, but didn't
specify how many. When I ask again, I
get the same list, even though I know
I've provided one of the items. So I
just don't know if I need multiple of
any of them."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits,
"You probably only need one of each."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"When Cheri called me up and said some
things which I totally didn't get until
we learned of the plan, I didn't know
how to respond. I could have lost a
dear friend there whom I so care about
and respect."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels
transmits, "It's probably one of each,
otherwise the plural would have been
indicated."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits,
"Ok. That helps. I kind of figured, but
since the same info was being provided
I wasn't quite sure."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Well hmm I think it was prior to then
as they took her to Andy's and such."
sigh 'Oh well, one thing I learned from
that whole experience is that I'm not
fit to be Voice. Just not my thing... I
guess...
"Oh well, one thing I learned from that
whole experience is that I'm not fit to
be Voice." You sigh. "Just not my
thing... I guess..."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I'm very clear about the timing
between when she revealed her plan to
anyone, and when Metal Heart returned."
nod 'But none of the AEu Leiason knew
about it.
You nod. "But none of the AEu Leiason
knew about it."
'of the plan, that is.
You say, "Of the plan, that is."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Ok well I just had the impression that
others knew about it for awhile and not
just a week prior to the return of
Metal Heart."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,
"Because people kept giving off vibes
like why didn't you all do something?"
'Kind of hard to do something when none
of the civilian liason knew about it.
You say, "Kind of hard to do something
when none of the civilian liason knew
about it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"No doubt."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Tatiana's Plan B was horrible, but
when we were asking why didn't you do
something we were referring to why
didn't she get some sort of rebuke for
spreading lies."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I still didn't really know until after
we took her to the temp station. I just
thought Nissi and others were just
expressing their angst for Tatiana's
and Syona's behavior."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"So when they asked me to intervene and
call for security from the AEU
Government, of course I complied."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"If the matter of if she was lying or
not hadn't been up in the air, if it
had been met with an official statement
by the AEU pilot corps, I doubt Tatiana
would have even been on that Andy's
trip."
Lily Kaise nods.
'The government felt her story wasn't
credible, and they told me that they
planned to do nothing until the crew of
MEtal Heart got back.
You say, "The government felt her story
wasn't credible, and they told me that
they planned to do nothing until the
crew of MEtal Heart got back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Yeah they wanted to investigate
further and felt they couldn't until
the crew returned."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Which I would say is only fair.
However had we been informed of her
plan, then I know Shule would have
informed the AEU Liaison."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I keep hearing that phrase."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Then they likely would have detained
her moreso."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"Why wouldn't you have done something
yourselves?"
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth
accent, "Huh I didn't know anything. I
just told you Akemi!"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Yes, but you're saying that if you had
known, you would have informed the
Liaison."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I did not know about her plan until
you all returned."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But Emily and company did no doubt but
Emily chose to withhold information."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"And my question is, if you had known,
why wouldn't you have just done
something yourselves? I can understand
wanting to work with your government,
but all the pilot corps have a lot of
autonomy to take their own actions
too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I was literally in my first day as
Voice of the Corps too."
'I'm a civilian pilot, not a police
officer. I have no right to revoke her
license or stop her from spreading more
lies. She did it openiny over AEU
channel.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks
its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
You say, "I'm a civilian pilot, not a
police officer. I have no right to
revoke her license or stop her from
spreading more lies. She did it openiny
over AEU channel."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Exactly."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"Did you confront her over that same
channel about her lies, then?"
,'We did, several times
I don't understand that.
'We did.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"We are merely messengers and remember
that. We can only provide information
to our Government's Liaison and it's
their responsibility to take action."
You say, "We did."
'On numerous occasions.
You say, "On numerous occasions."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"We sure did."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But she told even more lies."
'So she turned to the other alliances,

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Even a lie that I had sent her a

Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth
accent, "Crazy!"
'When I asked her for proof regarding
Lily's threatening letter, she promptly

You say, "When I asked her for proof
regarding Lily's threatening letter,
she promptly told me she didn't owe me

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Yeah and so they seemed to be going
against us too and we still feel
alienated."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,
"Do you think we are happy that a
couple of twits like Takana, Nils and
Tatiana and Syona have totally fucked
us over?"
Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Yeah and Damien couldn't produce
anything either but his big mouth."

You say, "Needless to say, it was most
definitely not one of the AEU's finest
hours. For any of us."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Definitely not and we're not able to
grow our Pilot Corps because of
misfits."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I don't think you're happy about any
of this stuff, at all. I guess I'm just
wondering why the AEU pilot corps
didn't make some sort of statement
about it. Officially distancing all of
you from what she did when it became
obvious she was a liar through a
statement, or the more extreme options
of holding a vote to make her a rogue,
or whatever else might have seemed
appropriate."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Well I did to the respective Voices."
'A vote was taken to see how the pilot
corps felt aobut her statement.
You say, "A vote was taken to see how
the pilot corps felt aobut her

Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,

You say, "Er, felt about her statment."
'statement
You say, "Statement."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"They just swept it under the rug and I
don't see how we weren't making obvious
statements."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"We individually made it clear that we
did not approve of her actions."
'And she saw  the result of that vote.
That's when she really started to go to
the other alliances.
You say, "And she saw the result of
that vote. That's when she really
started to go to the other alliances."
Lily Kaise nods.
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"Did you make those results available
to the public?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"She was totally pissed when I posted
that she was blacklisted."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls
its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's
neck.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Also Akemi with all due respect, I am
not qualified to make statements on
behalf of our Government unless
requested to. I can however, as a
Civilian Pilot express my own opinions

Melinda and others put us down for
being too harsh."

she no longer had the respect of the

You say, "Which is untrue as Nils
resigned of her own free will and
because she felt she no longer had the
respect of the other alliances."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,

was entirely on her own head, no one
forced her to do anything."

You nod to Akemi Bando. "People were.
Over General."
Lily Kaise nods.
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"Who, Takana?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Takana was a nitwit."
Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up
and down like a space parakeet.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,

Lily says to you in a New Earth accent,
"Are you sure it was Damien? He was on
the South Expedition as well."
ponder 'I'm trying to remember who
else.
You get a distant look on your face as
you ponder. "I'm trying to remember who
else."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Anyway, I never said to make
statements on behalf of the AEU
government. I was asking why no
statements were made by the AEU pilot
corps as a group."

"He said something at some point about
us astranging our pilots." You nod to
Lily Kaise. "Like Nils, Takana and
such."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Well again Akemi there's a fine line
between what the Government would want
me as Voice to express as Voice and it
must also be aligned with their
direction."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"And here I thought you guys were a
democracy. That's bullshit I would
expect from the Fringe."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I know we as pilots made it clear what

he had only ever released one felo."

"Then he reminded us that he still had
three."
'oh, I missed that part.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I did too but 'I did too but I learned
later that it was only the one."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I wanted to keep him from being able
to release the other felo at his
leisure. He was not going to listen to
reason, and as long as he had felo he
had a way to make people jump."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"So I used the language he would
understand, and I shot him."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,
"But why didn't you turn him into
security?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"No wants issued on him at that time,
officially they wouldn't be able to

Lily says to Akemi, "I suppose too
there are cultural aspects too in how

someone versus how we would."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I shot him, he ran off, I stunned him
again and someone called out that I was
taking him down, and by the time I had
him subdued enough to put the cuffs on
him there was a crowd of seven or eight
people around."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,

Lily Kaise nods to Akemi Bando.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"He was still resisting, even after
having been shot with stunners, and
moving anyone who is resisting like
that is always tricky, so I brought the
group with me. We dropped him off at
the temporary station, and I tried to
remove his keys so I could empty his
cargo hauler of felo."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"I didn't know that either."

You say to Lily, "Wait, when did you
get stranded?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Awhile back."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"When it became obvious he was going to
keep squirming and make it impossible,
I gathered everyone and we left him."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"He had a few bruises at that time. We
were not out to hurt him, just keep him
from being able to do anything to the
ship controls."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks
its tail.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I heard later that Aisling went and
beat him hard. Broke bones."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Yeah that is how it sounded I'll say."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"He was left without food or water
because there is no restaurant module
for temp stations."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent,
"But why didn't nayone take any to
him?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"I didn't expect it to take more than a
day at most for the League government
to make up its mind about what to do
with this guy."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"Melinda could have I guess. I asked
everyone who had been involved in
taking him to the temporary station in
the first place to not go back, so that
he wouldn't be able to make allegations
about us hurting him beyond bruises."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Anyone? We were asked very strongly to
stay away but it did bother me. I
wanted to cut out his tonge no doubt!
But I wouldn't but he was still a human
being and even prisoners get the barest
of food sustanance."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"There was spaceport security footage
of how things went, and I wanted to
limit the amount of liability League
pilots in particular were exposed to

"No."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"But I wish they would relax a bit or
they need to screen for mental and
behavioral issues."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Really find out why someone wants to
become a pilot. Takana's reason was
because her best friend had committed
suicide and nothing to do with want to
fly at all."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Wanting to."
'Well, what she told me was it was to

You say, "Well, what she told me was it

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Oh well there you go, she was also
rather pathological as she could twist
things big time as well."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,

screening would uncover these things."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"What ever happened to that cadet you
guys had?"
'Which one?
You ask, "Which one?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Yeah we've actually had a few who
stayed around for a day or two."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent,
"You had one turn up about a month or
two ago."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"We've had more than that but I suppose
once the government interviewed them,
they weren't fit."
''i have no idea. They showed up and
then disappeared a day or two later.
You say, "'i have no idea. They showed

Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent,
"Who else was among your cohort?"
Lily Kaise nods to you.
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent,
"Heh you've been the only sane one of
the bunch from about last summer
sometime."
'Umm, let's see... Rebekah, Dorrian,

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control
Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently
not receiving power. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is
in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a
black leather captain's chair, a
wormhole drive tracer, a black leather
sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with
the phrase "Reminder: This ship is
equipped with a sensor dampening
array." here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living
Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give
crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large
enough to do much else. A long counter
is bolted to the wall opposite the
entryway, and two narrow bunks have
been bolted to the two remaining walls.
A small keypad is next to the door,
controlling a simple lock. The status
lights overhead are currently not
receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a
garage.
You see a small yellow ball containing
a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow
bowl, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, a white four

You step into another room and notice a
door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close
it.
The computer beeps in an imperative
manner and informs you that the
starship's sensors have detected a new
location of interest in the riftflow.

With a sudden feeling of impending
doom, you turn around. The scene
abruptly fades to formless mist.
The formless shifting void gradually
acquires a regular crest and fall
until, after several moments, you
suddenly realize you are on a wide
expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts
creak above you, and white canvas sails
snap in the breeze.
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature
with many claw-tipped tentacles rears
up suddenly from behind a plastic
wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to
drag it into the deep.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU
pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've
met our first tier performance goal!
Let's keep pushing for the second!"
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave
and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature
with a yellow shell and four small
claws beats its claws together.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels
through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than
of metal hull plates.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave
and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature
with many claw-tipped tentacles
abruptly flings itself at the side of
the tank, its tentacles tapping at the
glass, then it withdraws.
A short violet soft-bodied creature
with many claw-tipped tentacles swims
around a plastic frond of light green
sea fern.
You hear a "ping" sound as the ship's
computer detects an active sensor
sweep. The sound seems overwhelmingly
loud.
Lily Kaise activates the long-range
scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside
the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front
of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in
normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel
destination reached."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings
up the starship's navigation controls.

Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe
switches on the rift drive control
board, then pushes a heavy lever
forward.
Something deep inside the starship
roars to life as the lights dim
sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of
the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes
are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems
to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the
stars. Random shapes, some
half-familiar, occasionally form in the
mist only to disappear almost
immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative
manner and informs you that the
starship's sensors have detected a new
location of interest in the riftflow.
A massive cloud billows through the
ship, and when it passes, the ship has
been replaced with a small island of
grassy land, inexplicably soaring
through the clouds. Far below, peaceful
towns and farmlands checker the surface
of the world.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent,
"Woo cool."
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel
on the rift drive control board.
A gust of wind catches the island,
sending it off in a new direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips
around to show a new heading of 180.0,
50.0.
A tailwind catches the floating island,
pushing it forward at increasing
speeds.
The starship has entered a unique area
of space.
The ship has passed through an area
filled with radio transmissions, the
surface of a bubble filled with
gradually increasing transmissions
which reach a crescendo and then stop
all at once. In the silent center of
the bubble, bits of wreckage are
detected.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside
the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in
space.
You see a sleek metal quantum
entanglement communication device, a
rattan floor lamp with a light purple
lotus shade (casting a white-colored
glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a large
oval white and black cloth rug, a rare
black EAOSian contoured couch with a
hand-made white and sapphire star quilt
on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo
chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and violet aquatic life and coral
rocks, a small yellow ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white
rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
clear plastic food storage container, a
red plastic food storage container, a
blue plastic food storage container, a
compact red refrigerator, a purple
photocopier, and Purr the humanoid
service robot here.
You can go south and out.

supposed to gently insert yourself."
A medium-sized semi-transparent ovoid

he doesn't want to fall asleep when
he's in the rift."

This area of space is within the green

no life-bearing planets here. Instead
there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here,

language, but it's nothing you've ever
heard before, and the ship's computer
cannot pinpoint a source.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently
not receiving power. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is
in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum
entanglement communication device, a
rattan floor lamp with a light purple
lotus shade (casting a white-colored

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control
Room]
The control room is the hub of every
starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying
information from every part of the ship
to this one location. A large
transparisteel viewport provides a view
out the front of the ship, but
experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap
dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the
main control board, providing essential
functions like the shipwide power lever
and alert status. Secondary control
boards can be pulled up and folded back
to provide a working surface, or pulled
down from recesses overhead as needed.
Though the room is spacious enough for
a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is
built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will
stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently
not receiving power. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is
in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair
and a wormhole drive tracer here.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your
alliance, just like you, who have the
added ability to act as go-betweens
between the pilot corps and your
alliance government. These serve for
one term lasting six weeks, and then
the positions are up for nomination and
voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the
alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to
speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage
voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge
of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information
directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge
of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground
readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip
is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals
or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart
liaison within the alliance government.
This person is a government official
who is in charge of issues relating to
the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as
a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people
directly -- that is the job of your
Voice. But if there is a pressing need
to go over the head of your Voice, or
if, as Voice, you wish to communicate
privately for some reason, you may wish
to write a letter to your official
government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both
occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a
term. These actions are not based in
coded mechanics, but rather must be
roleplayed appropriately with your
Voice or a government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most
common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be
initiated by the Voice at any time
using the voting machine in your
liaison office's conference room. All
active pilots are free to vote however
they wish on this proposal. The Voice
may then communicate the results to the
government. However, the government is
not obligated to take any action that
it does not consider appropriate no
matter how many pilots support it;
hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election
occurs when an elected office-holder
has performed unsatisfactorily and a
vote is held to determine whether to
remove him or her from office before
the term has ended. Most properly, more
than one pilot should petition the
Voice to initiate such a proposal
before it occurs. After an appropriate
time, the proposal can be ended and the
results should be communicated to the
government. If the pilots are in favor
of a recall and the government
considers their reasoning valid, the
office-holder in question will be
removed. Pilots may also initiate such
an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning
their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may
communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that
they cannot complete their term and
wish to resign. Usually such a
resignation will be accepted within a
day or two, leaving the position
vacant. This action should not be taken
lightly, and all players should seek to
complete their terms. It is a
responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election
occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a
resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow
at least 24 hours to take nominations
and should then list all interested
candidates in a single proposal. At the
end of the vote, the results must be
communicated to the government and the
position will be filled. Note that this
is the only valid way to fill a vacant
position; an office-holder cannot, for
example, resign their position and name
someone else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to
call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new
treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with
his or her government and their own
pilot corps throughout this process,
and verify via voting that their
actions have the corps' approval at
every step in the process. A final
non-binding resolution must occur to
verify the final terms of the
agreement. If the government approves
the agreement, official documents will
be provided for all parties to sign in
a final meeting. Note that all treaties
must be justified by good roleplaying
and must fit current plotlines; buddies
in different alliances often want to
make their respective corps exchange
technology and such, but unless their
alliances have a lengthy history of
good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange.
Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all
taken into consideration when players
are seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may
unilaterally declare war against
another pilot corps. While this does
not usually pit the alliances
themselves against each other, it will
greatly escalate tensions. There should
be a good reason to consider such an
action, or the government will be
questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules
about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should
be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be
invited when the Voice determines the
results of a proposal. The date and
time of any important meeting should be
communicated to the government in case
the government liaison wishes to
attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders
are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and
unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six
weeks.
The current civilian term started on 27
June 2316 GST. Time remaining: 25 days,
1 hour, 14 minutes, and 15 seconds

A large cradle slides up from beneath
and stops, displaying itself in the
center of the room. Upon it is a clear
oval-shaped shell, which contains an
alien plant with purple veins.
This is a faintly pulsing stalk with
thick purple veins. The plant's primary
color is silver with a sheen of deep
purple, faintly reflective, reminiscent
of metal.
The plant is somewhat large, though
still not fully grown.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's
capital city's spaceport sits over a
large bay at the tip of the southern
continent. The pad itself is a huge
square sheet of white plasteel
surrounded by gleaming new starship
service structures. On the southern
side of the pad is a circular structure
with wide transparisteel windows
affording a fabulous view of the ocean.
A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot
Lounge,' and a separate doorway is
marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like
you can GO into either of those places.
To the west, a bridge spans the gap
between the landing pad and the rest of
the spaceport.

calves. She has slender shoulders and
slightly larger than average breasts.
Her face is oval and pretty, with a
delicate nose and understated chin. Her
lips are lovely and blush pink and
occasionally part to reveal a set of
pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and
almond-shaped. Her mid-back length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and
swept up into a thick fall of loose
curls down her back. She has oval pink
fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue
dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and

 She is wearing a short-sleeved aqua
sailor top with a soft white bow, a
pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans
with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered
on the left front pocket, and a pair of
baby blue leather clogs with a row of
multicolored daisies across the toes.
She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist,
a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate
ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, and a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly
labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms,
both wrists, and both hands are left

You glance at your communicator's

Notice from the Voice of the Corps:
Good day AEU! A couple of matters to
appraise you of. I highly encourage
everyone to read "A Pilot's Guide To
Preparation: Sixth Edition" by Ather
Jammoa. If you cannot afford this book,
there are copies in the Library box in
the Conference Room. Please invest in
the starship-related utility items
recommended, especially charge
boosters. One charge booster is enough
to enable you to jump from the Bubble
to the waypoint and there is a
recharging station in the sector. The
second item is that we have not heard
from John Stanton, our current
Industrial Whip since prior to the
beginning of this Term. I encourage you
to consider this issue and to please
write and express your concerns. An
industrial Whip should consider this
role to be of utmost importance to us
as we should expect at least one
progress report delivered officially
delivered once per day. If you have any
other suggestions or concerns, please
contact me. [00:13 14 July 2316 GST]

l asteria
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick
lizards. It has four legs: a thick,
strong back pair and a foreshortened
front pair. It seems to go on all fours
most of the time, but it also stands up
occasionally, using its front paws as
somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have
short but sharp talons. Its skin is
dark gray and spotted with dark green,
and parallel rows of silver-colored
ridges run down its back to the tip of
its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray
little in the way of curiosity. A slim
dark pink tongue flicks out every few
seconds. It is wearing a slim leather
collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its
stomach is bulging, but it seems
content to slowly digest its large
meal.
