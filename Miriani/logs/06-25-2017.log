00:27 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the three-person heliogaster "Enchanted Harmony", the three-person freighter "Shimmering Rose", and the one-person expediter "Auri" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the d

02:16 ["Magical Melody" Weapons Room 4]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.

I mean, like, how far you have to go if you're on beta and the place you're going is Delta or alpha and gamma, etc. Whatever. But also it means I start out with a full charge, no matter how long I do mods."

02:16 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "when i'm switching between bays i never go to the garage"

02:17 Calyssa Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "still waiting on olivia"

02:17 Olivia Cantrell prances in from the northeast.

02:17 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:17 Olivia Cantrell prances northeast.

02:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:17 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:17 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Hi Olivia."

02:17 [Private | Doraleigh Soto] Doraleigh Soto transmits, "are you in caly's mods?"

02:17 Olivia Cantrell's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Sorry guys."

02:18 Olivia Cantrell's voice comes over the intercom, laughing and saying, "Was getting something for diving and noticed I didn't have enough."

02:18 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:18 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:18 [Private | Doraleigh Soto] Doraleigh Soto transmits, "no no if eng opens can you tell me I'd join that!"

02:18 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:18 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:18 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:18 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:18 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:18 [Private | Doraleigh Soto] You transmit, "Sure."

02:18 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:18 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:18 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:18 You peer northeast and see...

02:18 ["Magical Melody" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset and a twinkling strand of blue lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a soft baby blue fluffy engineer's chair here.
You see Moiraine Soto (sitting on a soft baby blue fluffy engineer's chair) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

02:18 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it li
03:17 ke any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

15:20 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

15:20 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

15:20 You are carrying a stun turret in your right hand.

15:20 You deftly insert a stun turret into a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

You can go south and out.

15:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

15:33 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

15:33 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

15:33 The ship is already moving.

15:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:33 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

15:33 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:33 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:33 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:33 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20).

15:34 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

15:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:34 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:34 You must stand up first.

15:34 You stand up.

17:08 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
