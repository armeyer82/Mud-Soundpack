Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and green aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a blue plastic food storage container, Desiree the little
black and white spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a clear
plastic food storage container, a small red insulated cooler, a compact red
refrigerator, an engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst
butterflies, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, Magellan the
arachnoid security robot, a red plastic food storage container, Sassie the large
fuchsia felo, Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo, and Xavier the big silver
soldier felo here.

Kim Saunders glances around at her surroundings.
Lily Kaise smiles at you.
'Sorry, didn't mean to doze off there for a bit.
You say, "Sorry, didn't mean to doze off there for a bit."
smile lily
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise.
You smile at Lily Kaise.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think I managed to doze off as
well."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did you type out? You were in the taxi."
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "Since Kim is worried about getting
home, we'll forgoe exploring for the Aquarium and hopefully in a year or two
i'll find enough time to come back and try again for my shell."
-lily Awww, ok. Well, we'll try again later then.
You say to Lily, "Awww, ok. Well, we'll try again later then."
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Well, we have
until somewhere late in the night, but I honestly think we are pretty off
track."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well maybe as I won't have as much time
during the daytime to work with my own crew."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So if it happens, it happens."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Lily Kaise shrugs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well w we've gone passed where I wanted
to explore and I'm not back tracking at this point."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "We should go up slightly for a few
hours."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "From what I read in the book I think
we are a bit low."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We go up to go toit but we're headed
back to comms now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "To reverse our trip we go back West
southwest and very slightly down."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We're passed the area where they started
seeing the SLFS."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo bats at a small yellow ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker.
"Our trip going out was 31 4, yeah?" Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her
face as she ponders.
The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The NDB is up to 53 now which means
we're getting close to returning to Comms."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am sorry we didn't find it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "31 plus 180 is 211 I think."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It is and 193 -4 is also West
southwest."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's pretty relative now as this is not
an exact science. Since I can't chart to determine a better position, I am just
using this heading and may adjust to tune for speed when needed."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I know it's not an exact science."

Lily Kaise and Kim Saunders are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white
and sapphire star quilt on it.)
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We don't know exactly where we are with
respect to our original direction. Nor did we maintain that exact line of travel
either so this is as good of a heading as anything."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches south.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "180 plus or minus your original heading
is a good rule of thumb and it would be great if you can maintain that exact
line of travel throughout but if you wander the course a bit, it's not going to
give you a dead on heading either."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Others have used 34 4 and the original
crew used a more northeasterly heading and a little more up and others have used
32 8 and so on."
It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, a charter would have been
handy, at least for the return. I don't' think charts for the aquarium currently
exist."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Actually, if one can chart Coreward
notation, I'm fairly certain that the Coreward chart from Gunarsh would cover it
but not be covered on the typical Spinward chart which only covers 40 LTC from
Earth."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anfisa's huge Spinward chart which
covers 300 LTC would also accomodate this area."
It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The 80 LTC Spinward Chart would get one
pretty close as well but Nissi and Anfisa I think are the only ones who have
those."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It might actually cover it as well."
Kim Saunders nods.
The curtains close, to no applause.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Like I said, I am sorry we didn't
find it. Maybe we should not have stayed this long at that artifacting place."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Last I knew though Melinda couldn't read
Coreward though so that's also ratehr uncommon as a notation skill."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.
Kim Saunders examines a fresh fruit juice dispenser for a moment.
Kim Saunders helps herself to a cup of golden apple juice.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
Kim Saunders scrambles to her feet.
Kim Saunders strolls south.
Kim Saunders strolls in from the south.
Kim Saunders sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made
white and sapphire star quilt on it.
Kim Saunders says to Lily, "But it can't be as bad that you won't get a shell
for 2 years? There must be a solution before then?"
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a string of light purple plastic kelp.
Kim Saunders retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot
chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into her mouth.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No idea as it depends on when someone
else is leading a crew to come out this way and if I am invited."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, I am sure we can organize a
trip. I still have not seen the aquarium so at some point even I might organize
a trip."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I likely can't be available as much
of the day as I currently am though as I will be scaling back my work to less
hours per day."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo jumps into Lily Kaise's lap and settles in,
purring.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We'll see how it goes."
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Sassie the large fuchsia felo.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand,
looking up at her adoringly.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "We will. And we were just unlucky
with the storms I think, or we would have been there already."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Need to stretch my legs here. Be back in
a few."
Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made
white and sapphire star quilt on it.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo slides to the floor.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo slides to the floor.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep that is what I think."
Lily Kaise glides south.
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Kim Saunders takes a bite of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a small
bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo stares up at Kim Saunders for a moment, then says,
"Mrr" and wanders away.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rubs up against a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, purring softly.
Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made

A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches south.
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts close to a large semi-transparent
bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing
interior, and the creatures appear to merge for a few moments.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches out.
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws
snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.
A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle
around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the
distance.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the south.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo.
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo purrs softly.
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo stares curiously up at Kim Saunders.
The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a
refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches south.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws
raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly
while dancing around it.
The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh good I think we'll avoid that storm."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's pretty far away."
Kim Saunders nods.
Kim Saunders takes several bites of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a
small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Indeed does not seem like the kind
of storm we'd want to travel through."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Xavier the big silver soldier felo.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand,
looking up at her adoringly.
A medium-sized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a
blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.
Kim Saunders takes a sip of a cup of golden apple juice.

Sassie the large fuchsia felo seems to be hungry.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo approaches a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl,
glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.
Kim Saunders nods. "I think we will indeed slip past that storm."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
Mandy the old hefty indigo feathered felo wanders in from the south.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set
of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes
are green and wide. Her mid-back length, slightly curly hair is dark blonde and
parted on the side and smoothed back behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed
clear fingernails. She has a large black satin bow in her hair. She has a tiny
birthmark on her neck.
 She is wearing a red velvet jacket with modest lapels trimmed with gold braid,
an expensive silver watch with diamond accents, a pair of silky light blue
pants, and a pair of black leather boots decorated with neon green stars. She is
also wearing a light purple cotton drawstring purse, a metallic green touch
einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a delicate ring of silver wire and
small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace, a wrist-mounted
chronometer, and a standard starship flightbag. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light yellow shipsuit with yellow trim around the collar and
cuffs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head,
face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

You blink heavily and then doze off.
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders out.
You're really alone here. So very alone.
Remember what I said.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept
of time.
A high-pitched whine fills your senses.
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept
of time.
You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.
Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.
You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!
The curtains close, to no applause.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the north.
Samantha the large violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise's leg with a quiet
"Mrrp."
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
