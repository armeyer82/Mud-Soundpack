00:56:30 I don't see "lily" here.

00:56:32 [Starship "No Mercy"; Control Room]

00:56:32 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Critical Strike"; Docking Bay.
You see a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go down and out.

00:56:40 [Starship "No Mercy"; Airlock]

00:56:40 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:56:42 Board what?

00:56:43 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Corridor]

00:56:43 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "One pile from storage per pilot. Thank you." here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

00:56:44 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

00:56:44 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

00:56:44 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

00:56:45 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:56:47 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:56:48 I don't understand that.

00:56:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

00:56:50 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and a small hot tea dispenser here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

00:56:57 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:00:58 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

01:15:39  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:15:39 You are carrying nothing.

01:15:42 There appear to be 20 pilots recently active.

01:15:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Love."

01:15:58 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:16:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:16:35 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:16:40 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:16:49 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:16:57 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:16:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

01:17:10 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:19:45 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar". The organization has earned 1,722,427.80 credits.

01:27:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 167,518.59 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

01:28:01 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

01:29:01 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

01:31:38 The AEU reached all performance goals!

01:31:38 Top Performers: Constantine Stone, Eli Grey, and Kim Saunders.

01:31:58 I don't see "liy" here.

01:32:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:37:01 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

01:39:27 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:41:01 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

01:42:01 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

01:54:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

01:56:39 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:56:43 The AEU reached all performance goals!

01:56:43 Top Performers: Constantine Stone, Eli Grey, and Kim Saunders.

01:57:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

01:59:01 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

02:00:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] 160,000,000.00 credits have been deducted from the starship support fund.

02:00:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "The results are in!"

02:00:14 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise has automatically contributed 2,227,294.89 AEU credits.

02:00:14 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:00:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We did it! We achieved all of our performance goals!"

02:00:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up 7.3% from the last Conquest period."

02:00:39 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:00:39 205,919,659.62 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00 27 June 2317 GST]

02:00:47 The AEU reached all performance goals!

02:00:47 Top Performers: Lily Kaise, Ather Jammoa, and Shule Elemmire.
The current Conquest period began 35 seconds ago. The period will end in 3 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 13 seconds.

02:06:36 Lily Kaise says, "Nice bit of credits there."

02:06:39 Lily Kaise grins.

02:08:56 Lily Kaise says, "Guess we could go pay out workers."

02:09:03 Lily Kaise says, "That is."

02:09:10 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:09:12 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:09:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:09:20 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:09:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:09:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:09:34 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:09:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:09:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:09:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:09:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:09:39 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:09:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:09:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:09:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:09:48 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:09:49 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

02:09:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:09:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:09:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:09:54 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:09:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Glittering Belt."

02:09:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:09:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:09:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:09:59 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:10:02 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:10:03 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:10:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

02:10:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:10:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:10:45 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

02:10:48 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:10:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

02:10:53 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:10:55 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:10:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:10:57 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:10:58 Lily Kaise glides in.

02:11:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:11:00 Lily Kaise exits the ship.

02:11:00 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:11:01 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from elsewhere.

02:11:01 You exit the ship.
[Asteroid Belt Management Station]
The four-person mule "Liberator", the scout "Pathseeker", the two-person Accord gemini "Amaterasu", the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican", and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are parked here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go nowhere.

You can go south and out.

02:11:49 I can't find "sofa."

02:11:51 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:12:43 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:12:45 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:12:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyone want to volunteer to help clear up the old frontier processor before I ask members of other alliances?"

02:12:49 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:12:51 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

02:12:56 A launch trajectory is located.

02:12:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:13:06 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:13:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:13:08 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:13:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:13:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:13:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure. I can help."

02:13:11 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:13:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:13:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:13:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:13:15 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:13:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:13:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:13:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:13:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:13:20 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:13:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Whacha got in terms of battlesuits?"

02:13:22 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 996" has jumped out of the sector.

02:13:23 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:13:24 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:13:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sure."

02:13:27 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:13:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:13:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:13:39 Lily Kaise says to you, "Don't forget to turn your points off."

02:13:42 Lily Kaise grins.

02:13:44 You grin.

02:13:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:13:47 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:13:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:13:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:14:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:14:03 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:14:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:14:05 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:14:05 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:14:07 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:14:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "EAOS 4, AEU, 5, League 4, Fringe 4."

02:14:08 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:14:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can definitely bring it and I'm comfortable in it."

02:15:00 You scramble to your feet.

02:15:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

02:15:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK, you bring AEu. Shule, EAOS. If there's no one else, I'll open it up."

02:16:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Awesome. I need to switch minimods around."

02:20:04 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

02:20:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

02:28:50 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez strides in from the north.

02:28:53 Lily Kaise waves.

02:29:02 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Alchemist from storage and sets it in front of him.

02:29:02 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

02:29:04 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez presses a button on an EAOS Alchemist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

02:29:07 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sound off."

02:29:13 An EAOS Alchemist suddenly splits down the front and deposits Pilot Kerry Rodriguez.

02:29:14 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Here."

02:29:29 Lily Kaise tickles you!

02:29:30 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

02:29:30 [Aerial Fortress "Bell"; Deployment]
You see Jacob Smitt (EAOS Plasma Specialist), an EAOS Conjurer, an AEU Combat Universalist, and Pilot Kerry Rodriguez (EAOS Alchemist) here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

02:29:32 You speak into the microphone.

02:29:32 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shule, Jacob?"

02:29:36 An EAOS Plasma Specialist suddenly splits down the front and deposits Jacob Smitt.

02:29:37 Jacob Smitt says into the PA microphone, "Here."

02:29:40 Lily Kaise presses a button on an AEU Combat Universalist, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

02:29:42 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

02:29:43 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Excellent. To deployment!"

02:29:47 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Liberation."

02:29:51 Jacob Smitt says into the PA microphone, "Was setting commands sir."

02:30:12 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

02:30:19 Jacob Smitt presses a button on an EAOS Plasma Specialist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

02:30:23 Invalid selection.

02:30:25 You can't do that right now.

02:30:32 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

02:30:36 You can't do that right now.

02:30:37 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

02:30:47 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

02:30:49 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

02:30:49 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:31:09 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

02:31:10 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:31:29 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

02:31:30 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go west.

02:31:33 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise (AEU Combat Universalist).

02:31:35 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Ather Jammoa (League Paladin).

02:31:36 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Pilot Kerry Rodriguez (EAOS Alchemist).

02:31:40 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Jacob Smitt (EAOS Plasma Specialist).

02:31:41 You peer west...

02:31:41 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go north and east.

02:31:52 Ather Jammoa moves west.

02:31:53 You move west.

[Ventilation Tunnels; T-Junction] (inside a battlesuit)
Here, a straight tunnel branches into two alternatives. One can go that way, or one can go that other way. The possibilities are endless!
You see Bari Worker Horde Alpha here.
You can go north, south, and west.

02:32:09 Lily Kaise moves into the area.

02:32:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Horde and moving. Don't go too crazy with the plasma on singles."

02:32:28 You nod.

02:32:29 Jacob Smitt nods.

02:32:31 Ather Jammoa moves north.

03:23:39 Lily Kaise says, "So that beacon won't go down until around 0600 or so. I definitely can't stay up that long so just before we're ready to go to bed, I will go deploy it since it is the one jsut west of Mir."

03:23:49 You say, "Ok. Sounds good."

03:24:09 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

03:24:38 Lily Kaise says, "Will just relabel the current one and then label the new one to Home Alpha 776 so when the other one goes offline, everything is in sync."

03:29:38 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:05:08 You say, "Sure, I'll come."

04:05:11 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:05:12 Lily Kaise exclaims, "All right!"

04:05:15 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:05:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:05:19 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:05:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:05:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:05:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:05:35 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:05:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:05:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:05:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:05:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:05:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:05:43 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:05:43 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:05:49 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:05:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:05:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:05:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:05:53 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:05:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:05:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:05:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:05:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:05:58 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:06:01 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:06:01 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

04:06:02 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

04:06:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:06:32 A gold time meter is currently displaying nothing.

04:06:32 You see some buttons labeled START, STOP, and CLEAR.

04:06:38 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer

04:06:38 It covers nothing.
You glance down at your watch, noting the time:
1JM5M.1HN [0206 GST]

04:06:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:06:40 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:06:44 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

04:06:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:06:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:06:57 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:06:57 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:06:58 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:11:27 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

04:11:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You pick a type and a letter from the list and then choose a three digit number."

04:11:43 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, I see."

04:11:47 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Waypoint Alpha 999 is now known as Home Beacon Alpha 776.

04:11:59 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "There you go!"

04:12:05 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So I can't name one Eli's super station of ultimate awesomeness then."

04:12:11 [General Communication] Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:12:15 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I just didn't want to stay awake for another three hours."

04:12:30 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:12:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did ya move it or somethin?"

04:12:31 [General Communication] Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah transmits, "You wish."

04:12:32 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:12:37 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

04:12:42 A launch trajectory is located.

04:12:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:12:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:12:59 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

04:13:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:13:05 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

04:13:09 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (13, 12, 18)

04:13:14 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Score! Projectile weapon."

04:13:17 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:13:20 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:13:20 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Woo!"

04:13:24 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

04:13:30 The starship transitions into another sector.

04:13:31 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You still at the bubble, Eli?"

04:13:31 [General Communication] Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah snickers.

04:13:32 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

04:13:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:13:33 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:13:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:13:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:13:40 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, been here all day."

04:13:41 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:44 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:45 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:13:45 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:46 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

04:13:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:48 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Creeping up on thirty artifacts."

04:13:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:49 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:49 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:13:50 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:51 You stand up.

04:13:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nice."

04:13:53 I can't find "sofa."

04:13:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:54 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:55 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:13:55 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:13:56 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:56 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Oh wow."

04:13:57 Lily Kaise pulls you to your feet.

04:13:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:59 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:14:02 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

04:14:08 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Tau 4" has jumped out of the sector.

04:14:08 Lily Kaise says, "Wow I need to put a stabilizer on here."

04:14:09 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Alpha 6" has jumped out of the sector.

04:14:13 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "694 sectors, not bad really."

04:14:14 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:14:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

04:14:17 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I stopped at twenty. Just the trip home hasn't been good for me."

04:14:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:14:22 Lily Kaise says, "Thought I had one on board."

04:14:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:14:30 Lily Kaise removes Lily Kaise's workbench from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:14:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uhm...Lily, you know the new station inherits the old name right?"

04:14:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:14:53 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:14:58 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

04:14:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:15:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:15:12 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:15:12 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Aww man, are you telling me flow is super bad or something Rogue?"

04:15:12 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It should but i'm not as trusting as most."

04:15:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It does."

04:15:21 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:15:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I promise. Now folks at 777 won't know to go to 999."

04:15:26 You're already standing.

04:15:35 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So I just make sure in my own way!"

04:15:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Because now that whole sector is 999. Not just your new beacon."

04:15:46 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:15:46 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nope it isn't."

04:15:47 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Well, I think its slowly gettin' better. But I been in the rift for three hours now."

04:15:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They can't jump to 776 anymore."

04:15:56 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:15:56 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:15:58 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 2,611,111.11 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Debris-Burning Temporary Station involving the one-person missile skiff "Midgaard".

04:15:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's back to 776. So they can."

04:16:07 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "With twenty-five mins left to home."

04:16:07 Lily Kaise says, "I'll fix that too hehe."

04:16:15 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:16:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Ok. I only saw it on the League channel."

04:16:20 Lily Kaise says, "We'll see."
Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:16:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah ok. Never mind then."

04:16:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:16:31 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sorry Rogue, that sounded just like you said three hours."

04:16:35 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:16:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:16:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

04:16:40 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:16:40 Lily Kaise says, "I think he is wrong because it did in 777 and this has always worked."

04:16:42 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yup."

04:16:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:16:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:16:43 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

04:16:46 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."

04:16:49 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

04:16:51 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. even with the accelerator?"

04:16:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:16:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway yeah, A new station retains the label of the one there, so ya don't even have to label it."

04:17:00 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yuppers."

04:17:13 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

04:26:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:26:11 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:26:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

04:26:12 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

04:26:13 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet". The organization has earned 90,274.06 credits.

04:26:14 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:26:15 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:26:18 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:26:37 You say, "No, but I don't apprciate him questioning what I said over General."

04:26:40 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:26:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well Eli I guess you understand the dynamics of certain... individuals hehe."

04:26:47 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:26:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:27:00 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:27:05 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

04:27:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:27:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

04:27:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:27:19 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "The Cat's Meow" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

04:27:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule mutters something about micromanaging, control freaks.

04:27:22 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:27:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have used that technique for longer than that individual has been apilot."

04:27:23 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "The Cat's Meow" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

04:27:32 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "The Cat's Meow" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

04:27:32 Lily Kaise presses some buttons on the communication board.

04:27:32 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep!"

04:27:37 Starships In Sector:

04:27:38 
The Cat's Meow..........................(10, 10, 10)

04:27:39 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "The Cat's Meow" has docked with AFW Command (Dock Four).

04:27:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:27:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:27:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:27:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:27:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:27:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:27:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:27:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:27:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:27:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:27:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:27:57 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:27:59 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

04:28:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:28:29 You say, "I'm so mad at him."

04:28:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:28:55 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:28:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:29:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:29:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:29:14 Lily Kaise says to you, "Heh know what Love, I don't care. Just proves the point that he is so arrogant and thinks he knows it all and he does not and I jsut personally get the last laugh."

04:29:15 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:29:19 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:29:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:29:24 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:29:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. what?"

04:29:49 You say, "I specifically told him it had been changed so he has to go in there and check. As if I'm not telling the truth."

04:29:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "I think I must have missed something."

04:30:00 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:30:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh that some think they know it all."

04:30:06 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:30:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:30:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, yep that's for sure."

04:30:39 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:30:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have been building stations and putting up beacons for over 3 years I am aware of what I am doing well and I do it well in that respect."

04:30:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I specifically said that it had been changed to 776. So he has to go in there to check as if what I have to say is not reliable. I don't appreicate that."

04:30:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Appreciate."

04:31:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

04:31:18 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:31:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Aww Shule don't worry about it. As I said to you, I proved a point."

04:31:49 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Reapers at beacon c-12."

04:31:59 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Need help?"

04:32:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I know. I just don't like anyone being treated like their incompotent."

04:32:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, yeah some folks just aren't satisfied unless they check something for themselves. I'm kinda like that sometimes, though I do tend ot take what another pilot says seriously."

04:32:07 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:32:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That either method works. I am actually being more sure by relabeling the old beacon and labeling the new one to the desired designation."

04:32:17 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I didn't stick around long enough to get a good count but at least 4 and probably more autopilot was showing 96 destinations."

04:32:33 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:32:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup Eli you are a cool Dude like that."

04:32:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Most of that's probably debris, but I'll come check it out."

04:32:44 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:33:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Somebody tickle your funny bone Lily?"

04:33:01 Lily Kaise says, "He really is. I wish I could be that laid back."

04:33:04 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:33:04 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I thought so as well, but I've never seen more than 30 or 40 items on the list."

04:33:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, as long as they're not a green cadet."

04:33:16 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:33:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

04:33:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Last time I checked I was not."

04:33:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You sir, are correct."

04:33:36 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "About 12 here. It'll take me a bit to clean it up but I'll let ya know."

04:33:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But he treats seasoned combat pilots the same way."

04:34:02 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Not an issue, I just have been told to avoid them especially in this ship, and seeing that many looked like it might be worth reporting."

04:34:12 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

04:34:23 You say, "Ok, I'll try to calm down now."

04:34:27 You sigh.

04:34:27 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I have seen huge swarms, but they're kinda rare."

04:34:44 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. I haven't seen more than 24, but sure don't wanna see that again."

04:35:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:35:07 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "First time I've encountered reapers at all didn't wanna make my first introduction that many against me."

04:35:14 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:35:22 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That was probably a good plan."

04:35:30 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm talkig way more than that.. I coudl be remembering wrong but I'm remembering something closer to like sixty, and all different types in the same sector, miners, fighters, Reapers.. they were all swarmign together it was crazy."

04:35:42 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh it doesn't bother me at all because I knew I was right and hey if he wanted to waste his time, he can knock himself out!"

04:35:56 Lily Kaise says, "I just went back because I wanted to watch hehe."

04:35:59 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:36:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Cesar once told me a time he was fighting rats in a cruiser and he told pilots to just pick a direction and fire. They'd hit something."

04:36:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:36:28 You nod.

04:36:31 You say, "I know."

04:36:37 You say, "It just makes me mad."

04:36:41 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That did work actually!"

04:36:51 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Those were the days when we'd get swarms of like 40 or more RATS in a sector."

04:36:54 You say, "He treats people so badly sometimes."

04:36:59 Lily Kaise says, "Well it's not worth being mad over when we both proved him quite wrong though Love."

04:37:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:37:04 You say, "I know."

04:37:09 You say, "I'm trying to calm down."

04:37:12 Lily Kaise exclaims, "It's more worth getting the last laugh!"

04:37:16 Lily Kaise giggles.

04:37:18 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:37:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I was just mentioning that on tactical, those were crazy indeed."

04:37:25 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:37:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Got a couple Lexie, but they're swarmin ships that come in, so it's a good thing ya got out."

04:37:36 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Only time I've ever seen more than one type at a time too."

04:37:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've never seen the mixed swarms, thankfully."

04:37:58 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway, heh after this fiasco, glad we got it done."

04:38:03 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:38:04 You nod. "Me too."

04:38:12 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:38:15 Lily Kaise says, "Or more like did it when we did."

04:38:18 You nod.

04:38:48 Lily Kaise says, "Next time, I'll just keep general off and he can talk to himself and prove to himself what an idiot he is."

04:38:54 You laugh.

04:38:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:39:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Even repairin they got me to 77% hull, all my turrets and 70-some on my sensors. Them things is viscious."

04:39:22 You say, "Yeah, Morris. No kiding1."

04:39:28 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We need short-range mechanical weapons."

04:39:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Got three of 'em though."

04:39:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Yep."

04:39:37 Lily Kaise asks, "Imagine how funny it would have been had he said something and nobody responded so he beat it over there to see that he was quite wrong?"

04:39:41 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They're called bolt throwers, Eli."

04:39:51 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep."

04:39:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No no. Those are long-range do almost nothin weapons."

04:39:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:39:56 You say, "Yeah, it would have been."

04:39:59 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

04:40:12 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

04:40:26 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They decided they didn't wanna finish the fight Lexie."

04:41:04 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Good deal. Thanks for convincing of the necessity of not fighting."

04:41:07 Lily Kaise says, "Trust me Love, he will do a whole lot more of this proving himself to be quite an idiot over time. I do wish I wouldn't have pointed it out though."

04:41:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:41:15 You laugh.

04:41:20 You say, "Someone had to say it."

04:41:23 You chuckle.

04:41:56 Lily Kaise says, "Well I did have to turn it into a joke or yeah there would be fireworks."

04:42:03 You say, "I know."

04:42:18 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. Reapers are a pain in a fully upgraded fighter. In a cargo hauler, well...while you could probably do some damage, it likely wouldn't be fast enough. These groups of reapers that have been showin up lately are seemin to like to seek out the ship in the sector and hit 5 and 6 at a time."

04:42:38 Lily Kaise says, "Oh that news story I doubt it was one of us who went off like that. I mean none of us generally hangout in dives."

04:42:39 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Vast legions of tiny space robots are drilling all."

04:42:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

04:42:52 You say, "Yeah."

04:42:57 You say, "I don't think so either."

04:43:02 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Woo, finally made it home."

04:43:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo."

04:43:15 Lily Kaise says, "Unless they went to Chets grill or Spaceman Rogers."

04:43:18 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:43:20 You laugh.

04:43:35 You say, "Well, I heard them talking about going to Roger's the other night."

04:43:48 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm about ready to start heading back myself, but I'm too close to thirty, gonna go ahead and try for three more."

04:44:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 13,183,593.75 credits from a xenology submission.

04:44:35 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think we were actually pretty close out hre. I was detecting a ship a mere 124 lightminutes away."

04:44:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Woo! Go artifacts!"

04:45:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "That's a lotta sectors."

04:45:40 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I was tryin' to practice with hyper caster while out there."

04:46:13 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, sorry if I missed any of your casts. I was kinda out of it during parts."

04:46:23 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Its all good."

04:46:35 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I do like the name of your ship."

04:47:14 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Welcome."

04:47:23 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ooh,  organic sheres. Those are good right?"

04:47:23 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Be watchfuled of casting unto great blackness, least it answers back."

04:47:29 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er spheres."

04:48:14 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What was yours? Like I sai I missed all of them except for johann."

04:48:40 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'm crossfire."

04:48:54 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nice!"

04:49:16 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:50:16 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "I greatly enjoyed putting hypercaster next to aquarium."

04:51:12 You notice that your hair is now mid-back length.

04:53:42 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

04:55:45 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah well that probably did it."

04:55:47 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:56:23 Lily Kaise says, "Still, I wouldn't be surprised if Vernos went off like that and he may have that time."

04:56:31 You nod.

04:56:44 Lily Kaise says, "He is a loose cannon."

04:56:58 You say, "He's certainly a loose something."

04:57:01 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:57:05 You laugh.

04:57:27 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:57:43 Lily Kaise says, "People like him are first to try to point at others because they think they can then get away with worse but they eventually prove themselves to be fools."

04:57:50 You nod.

04:57:58 Lily Kaise says, "Jsut like Tatiana and Takana and Nils."

04:58:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet". The organization has earned 21,704.28 credits.

04:58:55 You say, "Exactly."

05:01:49 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:01:56 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:01:59 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:02:10 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:02:20 You say to Lily, "Ready to go lie down?"

05:02:37 Lily Kaise nods.

05:02:40 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:02:44 Lily Kaise glides south.

05:02:52 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

13:01:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:43:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:44:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:44:14 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:44:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:44:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:44:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:44:34 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:44:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:44:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:44:39  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim blue stone linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

13:44:39 You are carrying nothing.

13:44:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:44:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:44:44 You can't go that way.

13:44:48 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

13:44:48 You can go out and enter into the ship.

13:44:48 You exit the ship.

13:44:49 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, a space lifter, a space lifter, a space lifter, a space lifter, a space lifter, and a space lifter here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

13:44:53 You key in a transport of William Dove to your location.

13:44:53 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

13:44:55 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

13:44:55 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

13:44:57 Board what?

13:44:59 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

13:45:09 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:53:32 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

19:00:35 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I need one or more for beacons."

19:00:49 [Tactical Communication] Soleta Teale transmits, "Am I counted?"

19:00:53 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes."

19:01:00 [Tactical Communication] Soleta Teale transmits, "Thank you."

19:06:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-s
19:06:21 ized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

19:06:23  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim blue stone linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

19:06:23 You are carrying Cheri-Pye the sleeping large light violet felo in your right hand.

19:06:37 Your communicator reports that...

19:06:37 
At least four recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

19:06:44 You scramble to your feet.

19:06:44 Cheri-Pye the sleeping large light violet felo slides to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:06:47 You exit the ship.

19:06:47 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" and the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 949" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, a space lifter, a space lifter, a space lifter, a space lifter, a space lifter, and a space lifter here.

19:06:51 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:06:52 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:06:52 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:06:54 You sit down.

19:06:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:06:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:06:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:07:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:07:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:07:10 The ship is already moving.

19:07:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:07:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:07:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:07:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

19:07:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:07:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:07:19 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:07:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.

19:11:41 [Starship "Cassowary Rising"; Weapons Room Four]

19:11:41 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling gray leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.

19:11:46 You sit down on a swiveling gray leather gunner's chair.

19:11:52 You peer down...

19:11:52 
[Starship "Cassowary Rising"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling gray leather gunner's chair and Lillian Hudson's workbench here.

19:13:15 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The six-person pincer "Cassowary Rising" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.

20:17:44 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:17:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:17:45 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:17:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:17:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:17:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:17:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

20:17:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:18:02 The ship is already moving.

20:18:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:18:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:18:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:18:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:18:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:18:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:18:10 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:18:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:18:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:18:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:18:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:18:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:18:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

20:18:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:18:56 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:19:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:19:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:19:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:19:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:25:21 Melinda Michaels says, "Not bad."

20:25:36 You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.

20:25:52 Katina says to Melinda, "Oh?"

20:25:53 Keying her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, Melinda Michaels laughs.

20:26:02 Melinda says to Katina, "Oh?"

20:26:15 Katina coughs softly, and hides a smile.

20:26:20 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Pretty Plants".

20:26:22 Melinda says to Katina, "Strawberry?"

20:26:33 Katina says to Melinda, "Nah was just wanted to be enlightened."

20:26:37 Katina Faye smirks.

20:26:40 You chuckle.

20:26:44 Melinda says to Katina, "You want me to tell you the strawberry experience?"

20:26:46 You say, "Careful what you ask for."

20:26:49 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:26:57 Katina Faye says, "I've been warned, so I'm not sure."

20:27:01 Melinda Michaels grins.

20:27:02 You chuckle.

20:27:07 Melinda Michaels says, "Well you see."

20:27:10 Katina Faye laughs.

20:27:21 Melinda Michaels says, "I got this strawberry stuff and put it on her nose."

20:27:28 Katina Faye nods.

20:27:41 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "And now they want to know the strawberry experience."

20:28:00 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Never mind, you wouldn't understand."

20:28:01 Katina Faye says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "What happened next Mel?"

20:28:12 Melinda Michaels laughs.

20:28:16 Katina Faye giggles.

20:28:20 Melinda Michaels says, "Well I told her to pick."

20:28:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Door 1, 2 or 3."

20:28:35 Katina Faye gasps.

20:28:54 Melinda Michaels says, "Which door she picked depended on if she had to clean it off, if I had to clean it off or if I got to put it somewhere else."

20:28:55 Lillian Hudson just arrived.

20:28:58 Lillian Hudson sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

20:29:01 Melinda Michaels says, "And that's the story."

20:29:02 Melinda Michaels laughs.

20:29:05 You laugh.

20:29:07 Lillian Hudson asks, "Did you tell them?"

20:29:10 Lillian Hudson takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

20:29:13 Melinda says to Lillian, "Part of it."

20:29:15 Lillian Hudson laughs.

20:29:19 Melinda says to Lillian, "The door part."

20:29:21 You say, "I think I've heard part of this before though."

20:29:29 Lillian Hudson says, "So, there are three doors."

20:29:31 Lillian Hudson grins.

20:29:34 Melinda says to you, "You've heard the door game, yes."

20:29:34 You grin.

20:29:47 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

20:29:57 Melinda Michaels asks, "So guess which door she picked?"

20:29:59 Melinda Michaels laughs.

20:30:09 Lillian Hudson says, "Better than breaking the fourth wall though."

20:30:10 Soleta Teale just arrived.

20:30:14 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:30:17 Melinda Michaels grins.

20:30:20 Lillian Hudson orders a warm butterscotch cookie.

20:30:22 Lillian Hudson forcefully hurls a warm butterscotch cookie at Soleta Teale.

20:30:22 Soleta Teale deftly catches it.

20:30:25 Katina Faye says, "I'm confused about the doors."

20:30:30 You chuckle.

20:30:33 Soleta Teale smiles at Lillian Hudson.

20:30:36 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

20:30:40 Soleta Teale takes a bite of a warm butterscotch cookie.

20:30:45 Lillian Hudson says, "I really need that cookie cannon."

20:30:50 Soleta Teale arches an eyebrow.

20:30:59 Melinda says to Katina, "Okay door 1 I had to get the stuff off her nose. Door 2, she had to do it. Door 3, I got to put stuff other places and maybe clean it off."

20:31:04 Melinda Michaels smirks.

20:31:06 Katina Faye blushes.

20:31:09 Katina Faye says, "Oh my."

20:31:10 You grin.

20:31:19 Lillian Hudson says, "Twas much fun."

20:31:19 Melinda Michaels laughs at Katina Faye. "You asked."

20:31:20 Lillian Hudson grins.

20:31:22 Soleta Teale orders a cup of hot British tea.

20:31:29 Lillian Hudson removes a tyrian purple flip einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

20:31:30 Lillian Hudson punches a number into a tyrian purple flip einrophone.

20:31:34 Lillian Hudson speaks into her tyrian purple flip einrophone:

20:32:12 Lillian Hudson says, "Blake madison."

20:32:17 Lillian Hudson places a tyrian purple flip einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

20:32:29 Lillian Hudson says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Enjoy the gift, Blake."

20:32:48 Soleta Teale takes a sip of a cup of hot British tea.

20:32:52 "You don't want to hear anymore stories?" Melinda Michaels laughs at Katina Faye.

20:32:58 Lillian Hudson says, "Oh no..."

20:33:00 You laugh.

20:33:05 Lillian Hudson says, "Well, there's the rift storm story."

20:33:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

20:33:11 Soleta perches on the edge of a comfortable wooden chair, a bit away from the others.

20:33:14 Soleta Teale sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

20:33:27 Katina says to Melinda, "Rift storm?"

20:33:36 Melinda says to Katina, "You might not want to hear that one."

20:33:38 Lillian Hudson says, "It was rough sailing, but that was ok."

20:33:38 Melinda Michaels laughs.

20:33:39 You laugh.

20:33:43 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

20:33:44 Katina Faye blushes.

20:33:51 Melinda Michaels pats Katina Faye on the back.

20:33:56 Melinda says to Katina, "You are fun."

20:33:58 Melinda Michaels grins.

20:34:11 Lillian Hudson says, "Ah, another one we should bring to a paint party. I see."

20:34:13 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah sailing is fun."

20:34:16 Melinda Michaels grins.

20:34:21 You say, "Much fun."

20:34:27 Katina Faye says, "Paint party."

20:34:28 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:34:31 Melinda Michaels whistles.

20:34:38 Katina Faye asks, "What is that?"

20:34:46 You say, "A party where you paint."

20:34:49 Lillian Hudson nods.

20:34:52 Lillian Hudson gives you a thumbs up!

20:34:57 You grin at Lillian Hudson.

20:35:03 Melinda Michaels smirks. "Lillian was so shy at her first paint party."

20:35:07 Lillian Hudson says, "I was."

20:35:10 Lillian Hudson says, "And then cats broke me."

20:35:21 You grin.

20:35:23 Katina Faye asks, "It's just paint, what is so bad about paint?"

20:35:26 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:35:30 You smirk.

20:35:33 Melinda says to Katina, "You paint stuff on people."

20:35:35 I don't understand that.

20:35:37 You say, "Nothing."

20:35:42 You say, "Nothing is bad about paint."

20:35:46 Melinda Michaels grins.

20:36:00 Katina Faye asks, "Mmhhmm, then why is my tummy having nervous butterflies?"

20:36:13 Melinda Michaels grins at Katina Faye. "Because you are shy."

20:36:18 You grin at Katina Faye.

20:36:30 Melinda Michaels puts a secondary pilot command access unit in a black canvas gear bag.

20:36:33 Melinda Michaels tunes a tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator.

20:36:37 A female pilot at a nearby table idly pages through a catalogue of bridal dresses.

20:36:58 Melinda Michaels asks, "Right, nest now, paint later?"

20:37:02 Melinda Michaels laughs.

20:37:02 You exclaim, "Woo!"

20:37:16 Lillian Hudson blinks at a tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator.

20:37:20 Melinda Michaels asks, "What?"

20:37:21 Lillian Hudson says, "Well hello Sol."

20:37:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

20:37:43 A Tardick lizard named Isis curls its tail loosely around Lillian Hudson's neck.

20:37:56 Lillian Hudson asks, "Wonder where he's hiding?"

20:38:06 Melinda Michaels says, "He's weird, who cares."

20:38:10 You nod.

20:38:15 Lillian Hudson laughs and nods.

20:38:21 You say, "Can't argue with that."

20:38:37 Lillian Hudson says, "I'm going to miss burn on this nest."

20:38:38 Lillian Hudson sighs.

20:38:40 You ask, "So, we ready to do this nest?"

20:38:43 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh god."

20:38:49 Melinda Michaels says, "That guy is."

20:39:18 Melinda Michaels says, "Let's go."

20:39:19 Lillian Hudson says, "Right. Nest. Um... Let me check the fort real quick. I don't want to be Alko."

20:39:41 Melinda says to Soleta, "Do you have a battlesuit?"

20:39:48 Soleta Teale shakes her head.

20:40:08 Melinda says to Soleta, "Ah ha, you need to get set up in one and maybe do a couple low deploys to practice with it."

20:40:16 You nod.

20:40:19 Melinda Michaels holds Katina Faye's hand, taking her into her group.

20:40:23 Soleta Teale nods to Melinda Michaels.

20:41:18 Lillian Hudson just arrived.

20:41:27 You say, "Me."

20:41:29 You say, "Myself."

20:41:31 Lillian Hudson takes control of Melinda Michaels's group.

20:41:33 You ask, "And I?"

20:41:37 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

20:41:37 Lillian Hudson grins.

20:41:41 Lillian Hudson nods.

20:41:43 Lillian Hudson waves to Soleta Teale.

21:00:26 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

21:00:27 (20 seconds roundtime.)

21:00:46 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

21:00:47 (20 seconds roundtime.)

[RATS Nest Interior] (inside a battlesuit)
This is the interior of the nest. There is no light here save that provided by battlesuit torches. Tunnels twist here and there, many too small for you to navigate. The walls possess a manufactured regularity, while the layout seems organic and unpredictable.
You see Sentry Horde Replicator and Enhanced Warrior Alpha and Battle Auxiliary Tactician Beta here.
You can go north and south.

21:01:45 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Katina Faye (League Frontline Soldier).

[Starship "Shadowwind"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair here.
Lillian Hudson, Melinda Michaels, and Katina Faye are standing here.
You can go south and out.

21:51:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:51:32 You see a black leather captain's chair here.
Lillian Hudson, Melinda Michaels, and Katina Faye are standing here.
You can go south and out.

21:51:33 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

21:51:34 Katina Faye giggles.

21:51:38 Lillian Hudson says, "It's how I show my love."

21:51:42 Melinda Michaels says, "Right."

21:51:42 You grin.

21:51:43 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

21:51:47 Melinda says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "I know."

21:51:55 Melinda Michaels grins.

21:51:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:52:01 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Rogue and I are out at 777 There is no way for us to help out this time."

21:52:04 Lillian Hudson glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

21:52:06 Lillian Hudson flicks a small switch.

21:52:06 A small light next to the word MANUAL switches on, while a similar light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches off.

21:52:06 Lillian Hudson ducks under the arm of Katina Faye as she checks a nearby control panel.

21:52:06 Lillian Hudson deftly enters a command on the navigation board.

21:52:14 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:52:14 Melinda Michaels says, "Nice duck."

21:52:17 Lillian Hudson presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

21:52:19 Lillian Hudson flicks a small switch.

21:52:19 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

21:52:19 Lillian Hudson presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:52:19 Lillian Hudson struggles to see around Shule Elemmire as she works with a nearby control panel.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

21:52:22 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

21:52:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:52:39 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Business Cats" here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

21:52:45 Katina Faye dances in from the north.

21:52:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:52:56 You smile at Katina Faye.

21:52:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:52:57 Lillian Hudson's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Katina, there should be some rats cores in storage if you want them."

21:53:03 Katina Faye says into the PA microphone, "Thanks bunches."

21:53:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:53:07 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks for the nest."

21:53:08 Katina Faye smiles at you.

21:53:10 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Who went to 287 in a void peircer?"

21:53:10 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

21:53:11 You hug Katina Faye.

21:53:12 Katina Faye dances south.

21:53:18 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

21:53:18 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to battlesuit storage aboard this ship.

21:53:20 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

21:53:20 You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

21:53:41 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It's why I take my scout most of the time. I know it's crap but at least it's got weapons."

21:53:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:53:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:53:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:53:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:53:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "How are you, Eva?"

21:54:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm all right."

21:54:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:54:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:54:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:54:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:54:10 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:54:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Glad to hear it."

21:54:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:54:13 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "It has weapons. They just got slightly shocked. And mel, when you don't even have enough for reps in teh first place because buying a drive literally left you with nothing..."

21:54:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:54:13 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:54:14 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:54:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:54:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:54:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:54:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:54:21 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

21:54:38 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Salvage a few pieces of debris to get enough beforehand then."

21:54:55 [Tactical Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Then maybe you should've thought of that possibility and made sure you had some extra onhand?"

21:54:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:54:57 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:55:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:55:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:55:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:55:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:55:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Prefer."

22:21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, I think you're right, I think it is the cruising speed."

22:22:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I think the speed is fine on the clipper. The grid though needs some help with a plant."

22:22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I use my scout for all things."

22:23:13 You kiss Lily Kaise.

22:23:16 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

22:23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Well, all things exploration."

22:23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I was going to say? You'd take your scout on beacon drops?"

22:23:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

22:24:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not that its impossible to do."

22:24:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

22:24:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh no, that would be a clipper, sorry."

22:24:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've done one in a scout before, with a Revo battery of course."

22:25:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I would say just because someone wouldnt do something or put a different plant on a ship just as examples does not make it incorrect."

22:25:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "So have I. Many times in fact, but yes, with the Rvo battery."

22:25:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Flying Rig". The organization has earned 188,793.19 credits.

22:25:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Never said that."

22:26:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But have you done a beacon in a clipper before?"

22:26:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "One should do one with just a plant."

22:26:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have."

22:26:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Throw one a spacesuit and just ride the plant itself, cut out the ship part."

22:26:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "So, you know how fast the grid drains on a clipper."

22:27:04 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In other news, 2 sectors west of orion's belt there's 3 rat miners and a nest."

22:27:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yes but with a proper engineer and a decent gunner, you are fine."

22:27:13 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In case anyone cares."

22:27:19 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's normal. Those miners you should be able to get."

22:27:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It can drain pretty fast, but it's reall not so bad if you pause a bit between shots. You do enough damage with one volley to do that."

22:27:27 [Tactical Communication] Soleta Teale transmits, "Hmm."

22:27:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's why it's called clipper."

22:27:36 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I could have, but I was busy trying to do other things."

22:28:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I know, but a speed plant wouldn't help it all that much."

22:28:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I think he was saying put the speed plant on it to use it for artifacting,  instead of a scout."

22:28:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Faster engine, more speed, less hits taken."

22:28:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Plus there is what Eli said."

22:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I didn't know you could use a clipper for artifacting. Who knew?"

22:29:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You do know that in manual navigation, it doesn't use it's full speed?"

22:29:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh Eli, teach me."

22:29:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yes shule."

22:29:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm not an idiot."

22:29:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Teach you?"

22:30:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm joking."

22:30:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "Oh I see."
