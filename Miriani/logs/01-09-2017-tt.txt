[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small purple
trash bin, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and
red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light yellow shipsuit with yellow trim around the collar and

blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic
phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond. Her head, face,

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is

[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "What happens if you cap all of your
points as a cadet?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They come in later."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Once you're not a cadet."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "You will slowly gain whatever points
you make after that over time, once your status has changed."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "But you still get them?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "They trickle in over time once your
profile's approved."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Ah okay. How long does it take to get
your accumulated points?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Depends on how many there are."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pretty sure it works just like any point
cap."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Okay. Thanks guys. And most point caps
you get right after from my experience."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Points trickle in through a cap, so it
does take awhile. My char is still accumulating points from an exploration cap
where he turned in a lot of stuff a month or more ago. Cadet caps might be
different, I don't know."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Damn."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "But they will be credited to you."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah, he's said he feels naked without
his cap, so it's all good."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Thanks. How do you tell when they're
done coming in?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You will lose the notation of a point
cap. Right now it might say cap reached."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There will be no notation there any
longer."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "What does it say for you with your
points trickling in?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Cap reached."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I didn't know if yours was for a
different reason or not."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's not a cadet cap, no."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I didn't know if yours was even a
cap."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Everyone gets caps."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the north.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, that's what I said it is. Too many
points in too little time in a particular category, basically."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Okay, thank you."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's done for balance purposes once
you're not a cadet, and to keep people from grinding in points. This is an RP
game, after all."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Gotcha. I think my industry and my
space combat are about to be capped."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Point caps on cadets are now 100, pretty
sure it's across the board."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Which is four times as high as they used
to be."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "So I've heard. That's ridiculous
because the caps are so easy to reach."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "More of an incentive to get your profile
approved."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "When my char was a cadet, they were 25
across the board. But they're really looking for good profiles. So to make the
game playable for people longer until they can get a good profile in, they've
dramatically increased the point caps."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The game is not meant to be played as a
cadet forever."
18:00:00
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I submitted one and it was rejected
this morning after 5 days so I just sent another one."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Make sure you follow the advice they
give you."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Very nice. Profiles are fun."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "There was just too much so I redid my
entire profile."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Probably a good idea."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I hate profiles. I love writing, but
I'm horrible at character development."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what this whole game is about
though, is developing your character."
[Newbie Help] Trace Miller transmits, "Agrees."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Yeah but not on the spot like that."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The profile is not easy, but it will
help you tremendously in the long run."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "It's not as hard as it seems."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just think through the advice they give
you."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I can develop a character through
story writing and things, but not just straight up writing about a character."
[Newbie Help] Trace Miller transmits, "If your any good at it, I'm working on my
fifth attempt."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Damn. Yeah I just submitted my second
one about 10 minutes ago."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It took me two, my first was a piece of
crap. This was my first RP experience ever, but I got feedback that I used to
turn it into something decent."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "If I understand it correctly it's more a
guideline for how your character is going to consistently behave. Included in
that is some motivation and history."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I'm not gonna say I'm not trying, but
I'm currently working writing a novel, so my brain is kinda fried. Writer's
block."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person
medium transport "Hoover". The organization has earned 1,007,178.33 credits.
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "So thinking up just one more character
is. Just. No. Right now."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "I've found doing a little RP while
writing something big like that helps refresh me a bit."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Doing RP does, but not writing about
an entirely new unrelated character. Playing it out helps, but not writing about
it."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Then again sometimes it makes me lazy
if I RP too much, because when I go back to writing I have to write all the
characters, not just my own, heheh."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on
Lily Kaise's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what being a cadet gives you some
opportunity to do, is begin exploring your character before you do the profile."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Exactly. I get burned out and lose
motivation too easy."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Think of it more as an outline then."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "And yeah I know, but it doesn't make
it any easier to write about. Like I said, I'm horrible at writing about a
character."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained
4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League
Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person strike
gunboat "Morning Dove".
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If hosts asked you specific questions
about your char concept, be sure to answer them. Read the profiles that are
available as examples, and go from there."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Like I said, I just redid the whole
thing because there was too much. I did read the profile example, though."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I've read it multiple times, actually.
And the guidelines."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "When I redid mine, I kept the concept
but scrapped the profile I'd written and used what hosts gave me to do it
again."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "I'm looking forward to seeing Harper
become a full pilot and to learning about who he is ICly."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Me too."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "That surprises me. I thought everyone
hated Harper, ahaha."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "Naa they just poke fun at his
screamy thing. Heheh."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just because characters have a reaction
to another character, doesn't mean the people behind the characters do."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "I kinda kept the concept. I scrapped
the history and education though."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Aeva, there was more than just that
yesterday."
[Newbie Help] Harper Dragomir transmits, "Trust me."
