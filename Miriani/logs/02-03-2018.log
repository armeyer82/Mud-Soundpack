["Endless Harmony" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex.

00:36 You peer out and see...
[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex]
The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the six-person dart "Albatross", the one-person AIE runabout "Locked And Loaded", the four-person roborant "Enchanted Chaos", and the one-person expediter "Dolphin" landed here.

Miriam,
I keep meaning to talk to you, but we seem to keep missing each other. The reason I've been at Kitty's station almost constantly is because she and I are still close. I know that both of you highly dislike each other and I wish I could do something about that. Unfortunately, that's never going to be resolved.
I care about both of you deeply and I honestly wish I could be with both of you. Yeah, I know that sounds stupid and weird, but it's the truth. I know that I can't. One of you is always going to be jealous or hate me if I choose the other, but I must choose one of you. I can't be close to both of you.
Even though I want very much to raise our daughter with you, I don't think it's going to work out between us. I know that this was my second chance and that I'll never get another one with you and I'm truly sorry. You are an amazing woman and you deserve someone who won't keep breaking your heart and will stay loyal and faithful to you. I understand if you hate me and never want to see me again. I deserve it. However, I will continue to defend you and be there for you as much as I can. Take care.
Tibo

15:23 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seaturtle, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:23 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:23 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Pax (Neutral Docking Station).

15:23 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:24 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

15:24 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Seaturtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:24 The computer announces, "This vessel's local archive of the Galactic News has been updated with new material."

15:33 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seaturtle, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Empanda Station.

15:33 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:33 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red leather artifact storage container.

15:33 You are carrying nothing.

15:33 The computer reports the starship is headed for Empanda Station (10, 12, 9). The computer estimates approximately 4 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

15:33 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

15:33 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Seaturtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

15:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:34 #$#soundpack_pong

15:34 #$#soundpack_lag 106

15:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

This appears to be an outlet for the upgrade facility on Edge Outpost. Off-white carpet serves to muffle any footfalls. A holographic E is projected over a video screen containing two animated ships. One of the ships, which is much farther from the other in the low-scale image, seems to be emanating some sort of antiquated radio wave. The wave is colored green and wends its way through the vast darkness before colliding with a receiver mounted on the other ship, blue bubbles representing speech spilling forth. Beneath the animated depiction are the words, "Long-Range Communication." Sales droids in uniforms denoting the Empanda Station logo bustle between shelves containing scaled down replicas of the equipment, and a lone clerk sits at a counter in the front of the shop.

Griswold Opens with a Splash
----------------------------
Parker Halvorson-Driscoll, notable retired Hale pilot and playboy of Commoveo nightlife announced his latest investment venture at a press conference last night held in his Commoveo penthouse. Attended by his latest partner, Mason Danforth of Danforth Steel, the sixty-two-year-old Driscoll sipped scotch and shook hands as he worked the crowd of wealthy entrepreneurs and socialites.
Griswold, a marine class planet located in sector 34 was purchased by Driscoll several years ago from the Hale government. Little was known about the goings on beneath the planet's watery blue surface until just a few days ago. Alliance ship computers were denied access, and Hale officials remained close mouthed when approached for questioning. The secrecy finally came to an end last night as Driscoll took the stage for his big announcement.
"I am proud to present the galaxy's first underwater tourist excursion experience," Driscoll told the assembled crowd. "We have a feeding zoo stocked with a variety of native animals as well as the galaxy's first underwater botanical garden." But tourist attractions aren't the only thing Griswold has to offer. Eager pilots and alliance citizens alike will be able to rent apartment space on the newly opened world. Shopping, dining, and exploration are some of the other amenities Griswold has to offer. "I expect this will be a real windfall," Driscoll
15:58  noted, "sure you have Kentos, but that's more on the research side. Griswold is all about the entertainment."
The ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place on the morning of Saturday, February third in front of a select group of officials. At 11:00 am GST, the landing site will be opened up to alliance pilots. A representative from Griswold Enterprises will be on scene to greet pilots and answer questions. Access for non-pilot alliance citizens will be granted the following day.

16:11 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Mekensie the droid, a gleaming red security drone, and a slim blue medical drone here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

Far to the west you can see a massive mountain; thick black smoke rises from its summit. Other than these features, the desolate landscape is unremarkable, if oddly aesthetic.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.

19:26 [Griswold; Underwater Landing Overlook]
This is an enormous overlook. Underfoot is a thick layer of fine white sand. The overlook is lined with pointed boulders in lieu of a fence. The water is crystal clear and calm until a ship launches or lands which creates murky patches and heavy currents. The sun beats down strongly here, warming the water to a barely tolerable temperature. A contraption hovers over the sandy floor which cleanses the water of sediment created by starships. Narrow gaps between the boulders offer views of the planet below in all directions. A large stone cavern is off to the south acting as a starship garage. There is a wide slope lined with colorful round stones that leads deeper underwater to the east. To the west, a jagged looking wall makes a sheer drop down to the sea floor far below.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Immortal Salvation", the five-person transverser "Nanner Puddin Poke Cake You So Sweet And Creamy", and the three-person voyager "Questing Tiger" landed here.
You see a treasure chest here.
You can go east, south, and west.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall antique gold lamp is casting a warm yellow light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a yellow saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a pink clock, a comical poster of a cat with its head stuck in a fish bowl, an extra large poster featuring an angry looking cat wearing a Christmas sweater, a "Happy Holidays" banner, and a small flat disc containing the image of a gargantuan multi-colored heavily rounded bloated sparkling shiny insectoid creature hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the yellow tinted window, you see the ship is at Griswold; Underwater Landing Overlook. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

19:50 You say, "I should go invalidate the keys she has to my ships and such. I'll do that when we get back."

19:50 Kitty Mars says, "we can go now and come back. I want your assets to be safe"

19:50 Kitty Mars pulls a small lever toward herself, deactivating the ship's systems.

19:50 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

19:51 #$#soundpack_pong

19:51 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

19:51 You notice Kitty Mars using the radio to request launch clearance.

19:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Infinite Sunshine, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:51 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

19:51 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

19:51 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]
Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "miriam" reports current location pinpointed at Apartment 230484.

19:52 Kitty Mars presses a series of buttons on the FTL control console.

19:52 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:52 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:52 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:52 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:52 Kitty Mars spends a moment examining the starmap.

19:52 Kitty Mars inputs a set of coordinates into a small navigation console.

19:52 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:52 Kitty Mars says, "oops probably fogot heh"

19:52 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:52 You notice Kitty Mars using the radio to request docking clearance.

19:52 Kitty Mars grins.

19:52 #$#soundpack social | grin | female

19:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Infinite Sunshine. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

19:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:53 #$#soundpack_pong

19:53 #$#soundpack_lag 153

19:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:53 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

19:53 You stand up.

19:53 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

22:10 You peer out and see...

22:10 [Apartment 26860; Garage]
You see nothing special.
You see the five-person transverser "Starlight Express" powered down here.
You can go southeast.

22:10 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

22:11 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:11 You press a large button embossed with the stylized image of a mailbox.

22:11 The computer informs you that you have no mail waiting.

22:11 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

Soon a lot of things will change, I tell you. I'm not a fool. Anyway, I already said too much. I should shut up."

I didn't see any fairness. I was just willing to try ti keep going. I know I have expressed my own uncertainty but that's just me being human."
