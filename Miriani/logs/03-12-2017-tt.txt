l lizard
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
