02:52 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 251270; Starship Parking Facility.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

02:53 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 51 Pegasi b.

02:53 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:53 The one-person space sleigh "Santa Claus is Coming to Space" has jumped into the sector.

02:53 Via general sector communication, Santa Claus is Coming to Space transmits: "HO HO HO! I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU, Tibo Beauchene! HO! HO! HO!"

02:53 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

02:53 The ship is already stopping.

02:53 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

02:53 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:53 The one-person space sleigh "Santa Claus is Coming to Space" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

The ground floor of the chapel is where any religious services take place. Rather than elaborate arches and stained glass windows, this room is simple and small. The walls are of a soft wood native to Desolo, and the floor is covered by a deep pile carpet that deadens sound. The seating area has several rows of hand-crafted, hand-painted wooden pews, with comfortably padded seats and backs. The front of the chapel is a plain, open space where clergy can stand, facing the room, or where people can pray in whatever manner they wish. To your left, you see a discrete, winding stairway that leads to the gathering hall on the floor above.

03:43 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

03:43 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

03:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

03:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

03:43 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

03:43 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

03:43 I don't understand that.

03:43 I don't understand that.

03:43 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:43 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Seven planets have been detected in the sector."

03:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

03:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

03:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

03:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:44 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 5, 8, 4."

03:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:44 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You notify flight control of your desire to land.

03:44 I don't understand that.

03:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

03:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

03:44 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

03:44 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

03:47 [Narth Polus; Santa's Trees] (indoors)
This large quaint shop smells strongly of pine and cinnamon. Several enormous trees fill the room, creating a sort of dense green maze through which a little man dressed in an elf costume is constantly moving to assist customers. Hundreds of dazzling strands of Christmas lights dangle off the back wall along with a selection of tree toppers. The shelves on the left and right walls are crammed with disorganized boxes of ornaments and crystal decorations.
You see a small elf, a small tree stump for garbage, a mound of broken glass, a garden gnome stuffed into a miniature tutu, a strand of paper snowflakes, and a roll of reflective wrapping paper patterned with gingerbread men here.
You can go northeast, east, southeast, and west.

03:50 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Narth Polus; Icy Clearing.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

04:03 You peer out and see...

04:03 [Narth Polus; Icy Clearing]
This massive sparkling white clearing is as smooth as any ice rink. There are several machines which discretely and quietly smooth the ice when starships launch and land. The fresh air has the hint of pine, gingerbread, and mint, and off in the distance, a trail of smoke rises up past the snow-covered treetops. Jaunty Christmas music is drifting out of a brick building to the south, and a tiny lighted shop stands off to the east with fat snowmen standing in its front windows. Bordering the clearing to the north is a row of festively decorated buildings with busy people rushing in and out of them. You see two smatterings of red and green glitter hanging on the wall.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a magnificent Christmas tree, a massive couch constructed from sheets of thick ice, a hollowed-out cocoa bean, a small gingerbread house, a trash can with pieces of litter frozen to it, an icy mailbox, Ohohohoh the droid, an enormous vat of chocolate fudge, and a large steaming pot of hot chocolate here.

06:51 A hologram of a beach sunset projected in the middle of the room

06:51 The brown sand of an empty beach ends at the lapping edge of a calm, flat ocean, Above, the sky is on fire with the oranges and reds of sunset. At the horizon, a golden sun has mostly sunk out of sight, leaving a wedge of fading light to fall across the rolling waves. The water ebbs and flows from the beach, the gentle waves ending in white foam which sprays up and dissipates in the air. Reflecting the fiery colors of the sunset, the vast expanse of water gently ripples in the distance.
The switch appears to be in the on position.

18:54 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:54 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:54 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:54 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:54 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:54 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 13, 9, 3."

18:54 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:54 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:54 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:54 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:54 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

18:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:54 You must stand up first.

18:54 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

18:54 You stand up.

18:55 A dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it

18:55 This ring is dragon-shaped. Its eyes are green sapphires, and its teeth are made of blood red jade stones. Its body is made of gold studded with little sparkling gems. When it is worn, its whole body and tail are curled around the finger, and its head lies on top. 'Miriam' is engraved inside it.

You see nowhere obvious to go.

18:55 The doors to the pod close and the pod slowly begins ascending. A hatch closes behind the pod as it lifts off into the atmosphere, heading towards the next concourse.

18:55 The pod starts picking up speed, very quickly reaching top trajectory.

18:55 The pod is buffeted in all directions in the planet's atmosphere.

18:55 The pod continues its trek at breakneck speed.

18:55 You are thrown back against your seat as the craft hits an air pocket in the atmosphere and then breaks free.

18:55 The pod's suicidal pace slows as it reaches the next concourse, gently touching down. The doors open and you disembark.

This large domed suborbital pod station is carpeted in a thin yellow rug. The arched ceiling and curved walls are made of an incredibly thick glass-like material. Beyond them swirl the lethal yellow and orange clouds of the planet which appear to be streaming past at an incredibly fast speed. Wooden benches with padded cushions are scattered throughout the room, and at its center stands a menu terminal where transport pods to the other concourses may be ordered for a set fee. A glassed in tube extends through the ceiling with some sort of hatch sealing it off from the skies outside. A stream of airtight pods arrives and departs from it in short bursts of activity, with passengers exiting the airlock tube via a small latched door.

A thick glass wall curves around the outer edge of this large room. Just beyond it, a dense mass of deadly yellowish orange clouds presses close against the floating concourse. The bright white lights set into the ceiling block out most of their light, making them appear darker and more sinister. The red tiled floor and bland artificial white stone walls make the room seem smaller than it is. Spacesuited mannequins stand around the store showcasing the various models and colors of spacesuits available for purchase. Each one is accompanied by an electronic menu kiosk where a customer can place an order. Small drones rush in and out of a pair of doors flanking the archway leading out of the store to the northeast, each one carrying spacesuit components across the crowded store.

This large curved room is made entirely of a transparent material which provides an unobstructed view of the churning yellow and orange clouds streaming by just outside the thick walls. The ceiling has been programmed to display an up to date real-time image of the skies above the concourse. The lack of any real decoration is designed to be disorienting. Even the plush couches and armchairs scattered about are a pale orange color, and the small end tables are all made of glass. A low constant hum fills the quiet space from the climate control unit which keeps the area at a comfortable cool temperature. Three archways, all appearing dark in comparison to this light-filled room, lead out across the concourse.

A large bulky machine made entirely of gleaming steel sits directly in the center of this sparse room. Tiled in a standard utilitarian silvery gray, the floors gleam under the harsh lights set into the ceiling. The bare white walls, in an attempt to make the space more cheerful, are hung with portraits of all the planets in the solar system. A low hum fills the room, and the floor underfoot vibrates softly with the intensity of it. Bright yellow caution tape cordons off a large circle around the generator.

19:16 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

19:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:17 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:17 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

19:17 The computer announces, "Two planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

19:17 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Narth Polus.

19:17 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

19:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:17 You must stand up first.

19:17 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Narth Polus; Icy Clearing.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large centra
