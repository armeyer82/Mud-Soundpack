00:05 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

00:26 Jenaia the droid

00:26 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying an old oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen in her left hand.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings.

01:00 You peer out and see...

01:00 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

01:00 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:00 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

01:00 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the eight-person gunship "Blue Star", the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", the one-person expediter "Stop Watch", the three-person antagonizer "Vae Victis", and the one-person cargo hauler "Uncooth" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Le

Hello Mirianians,

Have you ever wanted to have your private structure cleaned and stripped bare prior to a move or sale? Well fear not! We have made your dreams a reality. Just head over to your local private property transferral office, and for a modest fee, some old hag wearing a French maid outfit will break into your structure, unbolt everything and violently cram--uh I mean gently place it into a box, which they will then mail to you.

There are a couple of catches. First, you must own the property in question. So this means that if you intend on selling off a structure and want to empty it out, do this first. Otherwise, some lucky individual will take possession of all your items. Similarly, you must be the primary owner of the structure. Sorry folks, secondaries won't cut the mustard. Remember I mentioned a modest fee? Yeah. It truly is modest. But we don't do things for free 'round these parts. So be prepared to pay out. Lastly, certain objects won't be sent through the mail. These include other players, pets, mounts, and of course, babies. So make sure to get those out of your place.

As always, some unforeseen bug is liable to pop up. So please report any odditie
01:26 s. Especially if you're getting away without your money actually being taken.

01:50 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:50 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
Kitty Mars stands up.

01:50 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:50 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

01:50 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:50 You stand up.

01:50 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:50 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:50 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:50 Kitty Mars says, "weird I can't tell how much ink is left"

01:50 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

11:03 Last ten announcements:
[10/31/17 - 12:20 a.m.] Announcement: AAAAAND... welcome to Halloween! In classic Miriani style, we'll be forcing you to assume random costumes throughout the day. If you find this an absolutely terrifying prospect (as you should), drop by Styx in the MUD on Pax until you feel like braving the festivities once again. Out of comms? Type HALLOWEEN to temporarily teleport yourself back in communications range for the fun and horror. Once you're sick of it, typing the command again will move you back. Finally, until the day is over, out of character communication is permitted on communicators. Happy Halloween!
[11/23/17 - 7:24 a.m.] Announcement: Happy Thanksgiving (if you're into that sort of thing and not in Canada)! We're thankful for all of you. Oh, and obviously mashed potatoes. Have a great day!
[11/25/17 - 3:18 p.m.] Announcement: Christmas time is upon us once again. Santa is flying, the elves are sober and ready to make presents for all the good girls and boys. Have a look at message board post 88727 for all the details.
[11/26/17 - 10:00 a.m.] Announcement: A couple more rules regarding Christmas gift requests have been posted. Please see message board post 88748 for details. TLDR? Spell and grammar check your stuff man or it gets rejected.
[11/30/17 - 1:17 a.m.] Announcement: Due to recent events, I would like to take this opportunity to remind people about the mutual respect help file. Please read it when you have a moment and keep it in mind. Thank you.
[12/03/17 - 7:58 p.m.] Announcement: The elves would like to remind everybody to get their gift requests in as soon as possible to minimize the stress on us. You've got until the 18th at 11:59 PM GST for your request to be sent in. We would also like to remind everyone to use the tradesman labs on Empanda Station where possible. You may wish to read message board posts 88727 and 88748. Thanks again and happy holidays!
[12/08/17 - 8:24 p.m.] Announcement: Time for a reminder. Please, for the love of toast, when aboard a starship, please type PA-CHECK before taking it upon yourself to go out of character on the PA. Be considerate of other players. If they wish to remain in character, please respect their right to do so. OOC warnings will be handed out for violations. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
[12/15/17 - 12:16 p.m.] Announcement: This is a reminder that you have about two and a half days (check local listings) to submit a gift request to Santa if you haven't done already. If your gift request is rejected after the 18th, you will have until the 23rd for a second chance. Message board posts 88727 and 88748 for all the dirty details. Happy holidays!
[12/19/17 - 2:03 a.m.] Announcement: Combat Day is upon us once again! Go forth and eviscerate your friends for the enjoyment of everyone involved. You can type COMBATDAY to see your individual score, and, confusingly e
11:03 nough, @COMBATDAY to see everyone's current score. Typing COMBATDAY while out of comms will drag you kicking and screaming back in communications range for the violence. Happy birthday, Miriani!
[12/19/17 - 2:05 a.m.] Announcement: Oh, and for every hour you don't fire a weapon, you'll lose a Combat Day point. Exciting, I know.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub] (indoors)
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Public Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces
13:49 , a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets, a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread, a long black satin shawl with a red teardrop shaped clasp, a conservative black cashmere long sleeve blouse with a lace-trimmed collar and three ruby red pearl buttons down the front, a pair of white cotton tapered boxers, a black g-string with tiny metallic studs, a red cotton polo with thin white stripes, and a black silk front clasp bra with a black diamond rose-shaped clasp here.
You see Miriam Valleris (staring into space) (lying on a dark blue suede sofa) here.
You can go south and out.

14:25 Last ten announcements:
[10/31/17 - 12:20 a.m.] Announcement: AAAAAND... welcome to Halloween! In classic Miriani style, we'll be forcing you to assume random costumes throughout the day. If you find this an absolutely terrifying prospect (as you should), drop by Styx in the MUD on Pax until you feel like braving the festivities once again. Out of comms? Type HALLOWEEN to temporarily teleport yourself back in communications range for the fun and horror. Once you're sick of it, typing the command again will move you back. Finally, until the day is over, out of character communication is permitted on communicators. Happy Halloween!
[11/23/17 - 7:24 a.m.] Announcement: Happy Thanksgiving (if you're into that sort of thing and not in Canada)! We're thankful for all of you. Oh, and obviously mashed potatoes. Have a great day!
[11/25/17 - 3:18 p.m.] Announcement: Christmas time is upon us once again. Santa is flying, the elves are sober and ready to make presents for all the good girls and boys. Have a look at message board post 88727 for all the details.
[11/26/17 - 10:00 a.m.] Announcement: A couple more rules regarding Christmas gift requests have been posted. Please see message board post 88748 for details. TLDR? Spell and grammar check your stuff man or it gets rejected.
[11/30/17 - 1:17 a.m.] Announcement: Due to recent events, I would like to take this opportunity to remind people about the mutual respect help file. Please read it when you hav
14:25 e a moment and keep it in mind. Thank you.
[12/03/17 - 7:58 p.m.] Announcement: The elves would like to remind everybody to get their gift requests in as soon as possible to minimize the stress on us. You've got until the 18th at 11:59 PM GST for your request to be sent in. We would also like to remind everyone to use the tradesman labs on Empanda Station where possible. You may wish to read message board posts 88727 and 88748. Thanks again and happy holidays!
[12/08/17 - 8:24 p.m.] Announcement: Time for a reminder. Please, for the love of toast, when aboard a starship, please type PA-CHECK before taking it upon yourself to go out of character on the PA. Be considerate of other players. If they wish to remain in character, please respect their right to do so. OOC warnings will be handed out for violations. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
[12/15/17 - 12:16 p.m.] Announcement: This is a reminder that you have about two and a half days (check local listings) to submit a gift request to Santa if you haven't done already. If your gift request is rejected after the 18th, you will have until the 23rd for a second chance. Message board posts 88727 and 88748 for all the dirty details. Happy holidays!
[12/19/17 - 2:03 a.m.] Announcement: Combat Day is upon us once again! Go forth and eviscerate your friends for the enjoyment of everyone involved. You can type COMBATDAY to see your individual score, and, confusingly e
14:25 nough, @COMBATDAY to see everyone's current score. Typing COMBATDAY while out of comms will drag you kicking and screaming back in communications range for the violence. Happy birthday, Miriani!
[12/19/17 - 2:05 a.m.] Announcement: Oh, and for every hour you don't fire a weapon, you'll lose a Combat Day point. Exciting, I know.
End of announcements.

14:57 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:57 The ship is already moving.

14:57 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, and a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on the floor) here.

14:58 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:58 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:58 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:58 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:58 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:58 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:58 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

14:58 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

14:58 You stand up.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site.

16:17 Miriam Valleris asks, "why not?"

16:17 The sound of strained components echos throughout the pod. It sounds as if it's going to break apart altogether.

16:17 [ You shatter immersion and say, "says I prefer them to join me." ]

16:17 With one final burst of acceleration, the pod emerges from the wormhole and begins accelerating through space under the power of the relativity drive.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub] (indoors)
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

18:11 ["Sour Apples" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Miriam Valleris here.
You can go down and out.

This 25 year old woman stands 5 feet and 10 inches tall and is lithe with a large bust size. She has a dark complexion. Her waist-length, midnight black hair is pulled back in an elegant French twist and tied back with white silk ribbons and dotted with shimmering blue sapphires and diamonds. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth. Her abdomen is somewhat heavily rounded and swollen. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.

For a top, she is wearing a long black satin shawl with a red teardrop shaped clasp over a conservative black cashmere long sleeve blouse with a lace-trimmed collar and three ruby red pearl buttons down the front and a black silk front clasp bra with a black diamond rose-shaped clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets over a black g-string with tiny metallic studs. She is wearing a pair of sexy black leather combat boots over a pair of ribbed black anklet socks on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an archaeological artifact stor

22:08 ["Sour Apples" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
