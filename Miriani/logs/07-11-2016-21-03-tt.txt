Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a red plastic food storage
container, a blue plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, an
insulated green cooler, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a clear plastic food
storage container, an AEU Combat Universalist, and a League Paladin here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow.
You can go up and out.
(You are sitting on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and
pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short lavender cotton tee with a glittery shooting star
printed on the front, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and a pair of
strappy white leather sandals. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly
labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, abdomen, both
forearms, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

not crazy, is sticking around, working hard, talking to counsellors. And I'm
sorry, but self doubt is the last thing you need. I trust you will get there one

[Notification from Starseekers] A load of salvage has been received at League
Unmanned Pickup Debris-Burning Temporary Station from the two-person medium
transport "Big Yellow Eagle". The organization has earned 361,293.30 credits.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I do, I do. Like that other
rift sensor increase plant that someone found that doesn't take from charge."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, that they claim they
found. I still haven't heard anything about it since the initial rumor."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I dunno why anyone would sit on
that. They can pretty much name their price for the unneutered cuttings."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I haven't heard about it at
all."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Who found it?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I have heard that it was either
Starseekers, or galaxy sleepers."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, have we done this time?
Sorry, I missed part of that conversation."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I know Gray found the silver
spiral formations trait that Reets used."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Was it you guys who supposedly
found a rift sensor increase plant that doesn't take away from ship charge,
Kim?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we have that spiral
formations plant indeed."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I already know about that one.
That one is the one that does take away from charge."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If it's the one I gave to
akemi, then she probably knows better than I do."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or shule knows too, he's been
working on our lab."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Shule have you finished the work
on that rift sensor hybrid?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Not sure he did that part yet,
but he did say he figured out what all our plants do and what they take away
from."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh neat."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "His mind is probably on
something else as he is robbing graves today."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You guys should make sure that
they're all mutagened, too. Someone got jipped with a rift sensor hybroh, I
think that was a galaxy sleepers one."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, make sure that they're
all fully mutagened anyway."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That was the problem, I was not
around often enough to do that when I made the first hybrid sensor plant."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't know if you can mutagen
them when they're fully grown, to be honest. Never really needed to worry about
tha tkinda thing."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly up.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And no, it was not galaxy
buddies, Starseekers sold plants which were supposedly sensor hybrids, according
to ex trustee Jonathan gray. Akemi put me straight on that mistake. And well,
you can give fully grown plants x-7, it just doesn't do anything, so it's a pure
waste."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alas."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think that Reets had the only
really really viable rift sensor increase hybrid."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "According to what Akemi told
me, starseekers might be able to reproduce that result. I just need to be in
easy range of my office for a day or 2 and remember to feed the plant every 6
hours or so, I think."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Ask Shule and Angel to help,
spread the work out."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Shule put one in his sightseer.
It had 132 for Ecploration but I didn't get a chance to check the charge. I gave
funds to Shule to buy a cutting as I wanted to testit in my platform but he said
you all hadn't named a price for one."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is indeed every six hours,
yes! In addition, you also have to make sure that the rift sensor plants that
you're going to put into the hybrid were also fully mutagened in their time. If
they weren't, well, you might need to branch out and buy some fully viable ones.
Yes though, ask your trustees to help! You don't have to be the one to apply
X-7. Use comm notices, too. They work."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh yeah communications for the
stars!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do you remember what the
cutting was composed of?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It's on the to do list."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh well this was at least a month
ago so..."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uhm. I wrote everything I did
down when I did it. Unfortunately, with a bad badge of inc."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, the lab won't let you
apply Mutagen X-7 before the due time."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And when you see that the plant
has had all that it needs, you can send a comm notice to your org saying "you
can stop applying mutagen X-7 now you fucks.""
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Who would have ever thought!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think I did send one out to
mine like that, once."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "When Annie and I were working the
plants and such we colaborated and always got the applications in."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Lily, the current hybrid we
have is not the best product we hope to expect. But if you really want a cutting
of it, I am sure we could come to an agreement."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok well I gave him funds and if
it exceeds that amount, then i'll pass and shop elsewhere."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, feel free to keep
sending in your maximum drive velocity increase hybrid requests along with a
credit chip worth 150 million EAOS credits! Don't forget, Space Invaders has
many other plants suitable for many other needs of a ship operator! Including a
max drive velocity and rift sensor increase hybrid, combat grid capacity
increase and combat grid charge decrease hybrid, a hull increase hybrid, a
storage increase hybrid, and some other non-hybrids as well!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I even have a max velocity and
storage increase hybrid for the courier in all of us."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Admittedly, I made that plant
mostly for myself. I was surprised to see that others were interested."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Darn what an idea."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ooo nice. Ifever I can get to the
heavy transport, will talk to you of course!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was just going to say, it
adds over 3000 units to the heavy transport's hold."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And that really does add up
with them cargo deliveries."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nice."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I didn't know you could put
those on courier ships. Definitely something to think about for 5 years from now
when they get around to handing out promotions again."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I bet it will."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Again? I've gotten a few
promotions so what do you mean Morris?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well I mean, just ten cargo
deliveries means that you virtually get a bonus amount of credits in the 30000
unit's worth."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can put pretty much any
kind of boltable upgrade onto a courier ship, as well as plants."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And the speed surely makes a
difference too with courier work."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah you would and would pay for
the plant."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It does!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "In case anyone wants the exact
number, this is for the heavy transport, it will vary from ship to ship,
obviously. But for the heavy transport, it adds an additional 3472 units to the
storage hold."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What is the capacity of the
heavy?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "80000."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nice."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Sweet!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Imagine later ships that have a
hundred thousand or more units on them! Give them a 4% cargo boost and marvel."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have a pretty lot of
couriering to do before I get there though."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I like the 60k in the medium
transport pretty well just that slow engine but that's how it is."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I think I will hit the
sack. Fly safe!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Based on my reasonably accurate
calculations, you'll get an additional 2400 on the medium transport, Lily. If
you use my max velocity increase and storage increase hybrid."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Night Kim!"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup which is tempting but I've
done a lot of deliveries so far with the Medium Transport. I've received no
reviews but this number exceeds the number of deliveries for the other ships so
no idea when I'll get to the Heacy Transport."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Um heavy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's basically the situation
I'm in Lily."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Though a much lower ship than
the medium. Could be other things though."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh you have the Heavy Transport
Morris? That's great!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I said I don't even have the
medium."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I wasn't into Deliveries for like
forever but since i'm just looking for something to do and not concerned about
lots of points, it's kind of ok to do a couple of times per week."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh I see what you mean.
Well...I'm working on the points. But the promotions came much easier before.
It's been awhile in this thing."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah my initial industry was
through other types of work."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I do mostly priority right
now, but that's what I've always done. The other promotions came quickly. I've
had 2 reviews, 2 days apart...no raise, no promotion in sight."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And no, 2 days is not how long
since the last promotion."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I typically had 4 reviews or
maybe 5 prior to a promotion."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't remember for sure, but
I think one of them I didn't even get a review, I just got a letter. The other I
think I had just one."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't do Priority deliveries
anymore since I'm just working for cash."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wish I had that luxury."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Cash is nice, but at the
moment, points mean more."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well do higher points-yielding
work for now and a little courier as it's going to take you a lot of time to get
through enough deliveries to yield as many points as you can in less time
performing other work."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know. I do courier when I'm
bored of the other stuff."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My roids out at 465 do me
pretty darn well for points. Probably as well as salvaging out at Orion."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ah ok then you do get it and of
course when you can earn cash, Courier work is pretty decent. I did perhaps 15
points worth of cargo at 60k per trip and earned 194 million from my last
payout. I've earned more as well but that's not bad."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No, it's not."
Lily Kaise tickles you!
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "5 trips gets me about 1
points...which isn't too bad. One round trip averages maybe 3 minutes at the
most. So yes it's slower, but it does give me an additional option."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My best option, seems like, if
I want points and credits both are the roids out at 465, especially that one 16
sectors out paid me almost 21 mill."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That number is kind of not
realistically it though, as it was diagonal, not in one direction."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well Salvaging will yield more
points overall and then scooping and once you can get reasonable tesla
equipment, Tesla does pay well. Asteroid Hauling isn't much for points as you
will spend a lot of time in the process for just a couple of points but it does
pay well in terms of income."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno...seems like they come
pretty close to the grade 20 and 30 chunks in a light transport for the time
spent...unless you count the time in the rift."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nope it will take you about an
hour and a half to haul 4 or 5 and you'll only earn about 10 or less points when
you can break up shipwrecks and get a couple of loads in an hour and earn 3
times that in points."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I never find shipwrecks
though. I heard those are out at 134...which I need to check out, by the way.
I've only ever found one shipwreck, and it was huge."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "16 meters, grade 30 I think."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes 134 is a good field for
shipwrecks and you can also begin to artifact a little if you have 300 industry
or more."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I do."
Lily Kaise presses a button on a League Paladin, which splits open down the
front. She carefully climbs inside.

Lily Kaise grins.
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oops."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
take work
You remove Shule Elemmire's workbench from a leather briefcase.
drop work
You put down Shule Elemmire's workbench.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is
detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The
transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a red plastic food storage
container, a blue plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, an
insulated green cooler, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a clear plastic food
storage container, a League Paladin, and an AEU Combat Universalist here.
