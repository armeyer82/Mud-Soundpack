["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Hello!

After much deliberation, we're instituting something many of you probably doubted would ever grace the world of Miriani. As a further push into the modern era, GROUP-OPTIONS have been added, which allow you to control who can hold you or begin following you, as well as your automated response to group requests. To access them, type GROUP-OPTIONS (or, for the lazy, JOIN-O works too). The choices are quite self-explanatory, but some things should be noted:

* Idle means inactive for 3 minutes or more. If you're staring into space, you're vulnerable.
* If you're stunned you can be held or joined without consent. (This also applies for roundtime.)
* You can give specific people the ability to bypass your group settings by adding them to the lists accessible in menu options 1 and 2.
* We'll be cracking down rather strongly on people who use scripts designed to keep you from idling to circumvent mechanics. Keep it fair!

Spaceports have also received a facelift. By facelift, I mean that any public spaceport on a well-populated planet now has a jamming field. This jamming field, which is omnipresent and always there much like those neighbors that feel the need to const
01:01 antly hang out on your lawn, will stop any civilian weapon fire. Thanks to special chips installed in military personnel's sidearms, jamming easily discriminates between the two. If you're in any inside room (in a spaceport, mind you), droids, drones and handheld weapons will not be able to fire stun shots. Pulse emitter usage is still permitted.

Inside room, you ask? Yes, inside room. Every room in the game's world has been designated by hard-working builders as indoors or outdoors. You can see whether a room is outdoors by reading the description or, for the lazy, there is now a new option to show outside status in the room title. This is also being used for upcoming systems that are right around the corner, like weather. Keep a close eye on the Development Ramblings board to find out what's going on behind the scenes.

I think that's everything! If you have any questions, feel free to ASSIST or drop us a line at hosts@toastsoft.net.

P.s. We're now back on Twitter! We'll be using this to post changes, announcements, and system status updates. Be sure to follow @toastsoft for your daily helping of Miriani on social media.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede h

You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a pair of brown leather tennis shoes, and a pair of multi colored clogs here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.
