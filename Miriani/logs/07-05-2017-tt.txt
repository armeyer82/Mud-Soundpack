Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
(6_L'YD#^#gM8i0Z?+M?o#h*N#'\5cRU5Qd]L!nY
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

"Current riftflow conditions are 2129 light-minutes per second from Galactic

Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

l ryo
Ryo Stel
He appears to be 30 years old. He is about six feet and zero inches tall and has
fair skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has
broad shoulders and a muscular chest. His face is round and boyish, with a small
nose and sharp chin. His lips are full and pale and occasionally part to reveal
a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, his eyes are
pale blue and almond-shaped. His chin-length, wispy hair is white and neatly
combed. He has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 He is wearing a pearl gray canvas jacket, a gray heather cotton tee, a sleek
silver watch with diamond accents, a skinny mahogany leather belt, a pair of
slim light blue jeans, and a pair of washed white canvas sneakers. He is also
wearing a smoky blue canvas satchel and a pearl gray flip einrophone in a gray
leather phone holster. His head, face, both eyes, neck, left wrist, and both
hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the
vostok-class capsule "Capsicum".

[Starship "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

our government liaison and a notice to the liaison office. I did this on monday
evening shortly after I determined the results of our vote for a non binding

keeping with my duties as your voice. It would seem that our urgent message has

hoping it will reach him in time. While I am still in this office, I will do my

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
[Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ok, people, Chetumal please."
power
You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

[Starship "Rainstorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has caramel skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and
strong calves. She has rounded shoulders and rather large breasts. Her face is
oval and lovely, with a delicate nose and round chin. Her lips are full and
brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
expressive eyebrows, her eyes are brown and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length,
very curly hair is dark chocolate brown with gold streaks and hanging in tiny,
delicate ringlets. She has oval clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a sleeveless amber cotton dress with a row of tiny matching
ribbon rosettes at the neckline and hem and a pair of white flats. She is also
wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a
violet backpack, a flight control scanner, a primrose yellow touch einrophone in
a brown leather phone holster, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a
personal filing computer, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a purple vinyl duffel
bag, a compact metallic sapphire blue camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed
on the front with a glittery blue camera strap, a large expandable telescoping
xenology container, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are
left uncovered.
She is carrying a cool glass of water in her left hand.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

This square box measures about twenty centimeters in all dimensions. It is made
of silver metal covered with a mosaic depicting a large stylized white star on
the top with a pale blue center and a deep midnight blue background spotted with
smaller red, blue, orange, and yellow stars. The white star's tendrils stream
outward in smooth arcs down the sides of the box, curving around additional
smaller stars. The mosaic's tiny pieces of broken plastic and the thin lines of
silver-colored cement holding them in place are covered with a thin high-gloss
glaze that is smooth to the touch.
It is open.

A large set of rings floats in space here, glowing material interspersed with
empty space, like the grooves of a record. The empty spaces indicate where the
material has accreted into young, volatile planets. In the middle of it all is
the fuzzy glow of a new star, still pulling loose material into it.

Shasta the sleeping big onyx soldier felo
It appears to be at Starship "Intrepid"; Head.
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, spotted onyx fur,
possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked white claws,
visible only when not retracted. A orange, vertical nose sits below a pair of
clear indigo eyes with cassiopeian pupils. It appears to be sleeping.
Lily Kaise says, "So yeah and our menus are a bit out of order at the moment as
we have to reduce ours. It's sad because we ahd a great one but we'll deal with

a passing dwarf star which has pulled the red giant's exterior along with it.

her cheeks. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and
almond-shaped, and enhanced with dark cat's eye eyeliner and shimmering orchid
eyeshadow. She has subtle black mascara. Her mid-back length, straight hair is
pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back.

her shoulders, a beaded orchid dress with a bateau neckline and a scalloped hem,
an exquisite wrist cuff of oval tanzanites nested in small round diamonds, and a
pair of orchid silk open-toed evening pumps decorated with crystal bows. She is
also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, an elegant pearl and tanzanite floral necklace with diamond leaves,
a small gold silk evening clutch with a gold clasp, and a compact metallic
purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery

[Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Head]
This room is rather claustrophobic despite serving such a vital function,
clearly an afterthought merely tucked away in the storage room for the sake of
there being no other place to fit it. A stainless steel toilet which vents
directly to space is available for use. Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on green status. Looking through the windows, you cannot see anything because
they are frosted for your privacy.
You see a small stainless steel toilet with Jewel the sleeping large violet
glowing felo on it, a first aid kit, a glossy royal blue ceramic felo chow bowl,
a fuzzy tabby print bath mat, a portable deluxe purple shower unit, and Samantha
the large violet felo in the photo.

a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad [inside a mosaic star box]
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport. A light dusting of mold
spores is scattered across the landing area.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can,
the one-person fighter "Wraith", and a sanitation drone in the photo.
Lily Kaise and Shule Elemmire are in the photo.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,

Hi Love, The Salvage processing station is built and ready to deploy in 'Herding
Cats'. If you and Constantine depart around 1500, the station should already be
utilizing its Emergency Power reserve. Therefore, if it requires an hour to
travel to Artifact Alpha 777, it may expire before you arrive. Still, there
won't be much downtime prior to deployment of the new station and everything
will go well. Thank you for showing Constantine this process. It's great that he
is interested as he will certainly be a tremendous asset and help to us
especially to relieve some of the burden of deploying stations when it's
difficult for one of us to accomodate the task due to our respective
availability. Love you, - Lily
