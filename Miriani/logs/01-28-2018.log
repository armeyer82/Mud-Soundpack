06:59 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: How come, if I'm attaching anchors to an asteroid, and moving around the ship in angles, instead of going east, then west twice and so on, the ship says the lines are wrong?

07:00 #$#soundpack_pong

07:00 #$#soundpack_lag 104

07:00 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: You must be doing something to where you don't end up at the right cords. They have to be placed directly north, south, east and west of where your ship is landed.

07:00 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: Anchors should be going north, south, east, and west. A line connects north/south, another connects east/west.

07:00 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: So go north, use anchor, use line. Go south twice, same thing. Do the same for east and west.

07:01 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: I've walked around the ship North, south, east and west, and all the anchors are in place.

07:01 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: I'm not sure why you are saying ship. You have to place the anchors on the roid outside of the ship...

07:02 #$#soundpack_pong

07:02 #$#soundpack_lag 120

07:02 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: You don't walk around the ship. You walk north of the ship, place an anchor. Go back to the ship. Walk south of the ship, place an anchor there. The same for east and west.

07:02 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: And like rothque said, make sure one line is going north south, and the other one is east west. They have to go that way or it won't work.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a

17:18 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She has a green stamp of an oakleaf insignia on her left hand. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a gauzy fuchsia three-quarter-sleeved linen peasant top which has a scalloped neckline and has cute purple flowers along the bottom. For a bottom, she is wearing a ruffled white denim skirt over a pair of midnight black lace thong underwear. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring 
17:18 made of amethyst and multi-colored stones, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink armor storage bag, a pink stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity pink Lore computer, a deep purple leather briefcase, a violet rolled toolkit, a purple diving gear bag, a small handheld radio receiver, a sleek hot pink repair kit, an asteroid hauling kit, a multi-strand of iridescent strawberry pearls, a seashell pink friendship bracelet with kitten-shaped beads, a silver ring with an amethyst gemstone, an amethyst crystal butterfly, a diamond Commoveo membership ring, a violet spacesuit jet, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a bright pink snuggly holding an orange and white cat, and a small handheld mineral scanner.
She is carrying nothing.

She has a green stamp of an oakleaf insignia on her left hand. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a gauzy fuchsia three-quarter-sleeved linen peasant top which has a scalloped neckline and has cute purple flowers along the bottom.

She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
