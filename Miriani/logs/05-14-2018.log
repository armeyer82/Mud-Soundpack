01:01 [Desolo Island; Sandy Clearing]
The sandy surface of the metallic landing area gleams dully in the light. The warm air is humid and heavy, and scented with the salty tang of an ocean whose waters are just visible far in the distance to the north. A wide set of stairs leads down off the landing platform to the golden sand of the beach, while smaller stairs lead off towards tree-lined residential streets. A set of stairs off to the side has been painted bright blue, and these appear to lead up to the ITPN station and down to an underground garage.
You see the one-person expediter "Emarld Phoenix" powered down here.
You see the three-person supercarrier "Rise To Fame" landed here.
You see OK the droid, Medc the droid, Squeal the droid, Billy the droid, and Gash the droid here.
You can go north, east, southeast, up, and down.

01:42 [Desolo Island; Sandy Clearing]
The sandy surface of the metallic landing area gleams dully in the light. The warm air is humid and heavy, and scented with the salty tang of an ocean whose waters are just visible far in the distance to the north. A wide set of stairs leads down off the landing platform to the golden sand of the beach, while smaller stairs lead off towards tree-lined residential streets. A set of stairs off to the side has been painted bright blue, and these appear to lead up to the ITPN station and down to an underground garage.
You see the one-person expediter "Emarld Phoenix" powered down here.
You see the three-person supercarrier "Rise To Fame" and the five-person transverser "Infinite Sunshine" landed here.
You see OK the droid, Medc the droid, Squeal the droid, Billy the droid, and Gash the droid here.
You can go north, east, southeast, up, and down.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Desolo Island; Sandy Clearing. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end t

You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, Jenaia the droid, a smiling nanny, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

12:45 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:45 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

14:51 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a blue trash can, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.
You see Pippa Lancaster here.

15:28 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a blue trash can, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.
You see Pippa Lancaster (staring into space) here.
You can go south.

15:38 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a blue trash can, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

This is one of dozens, actually one of approximately 6.4 dozen, remote outpost stations scattered throughout Miriani Space. This particular station is located on the very fringe of the Local Space bubble around Sector 6, and pilots can literally haul asteroids from beyond Local Space to this collection location. The bulkheads of the landing bay are painstakingly painted in a smooth dark grey paint that seems to have an internal luminescence. The landing deck shows recent scuffs and scrapes from remote asteroid handlers as testament to the installation of an automated asteroid collection bay. In a corner off to the side, someone painted the face of an ancient dial clock with the hour and minute hands pointed straight up.

You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a red communicator, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a masculine gold classic wedding band, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a softly padded black snuggly, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a soft white cloth diaper bag patterned with dolphins, a black stun armor storage bag, a level six archaeological dig site scanner, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.

16:41 [Remote Outpost 12; Docking Bay] (indoors)
This is one of dozens, actually one of approximately 6.4 dozen, remote outpost stations scattered throughout Miriani Space. This particular station is located on the very fringe of the Local Space bubble around Sector 6, and pilots can literally haul asteroids from beyond Local Space to this collection location. The bulkheads of the landing bay are painstakingly painted in a smooth dark grey paint that seems to have an internal luminescence. The landing deck shows recent scuffs and scrapes from remote asteroid handlers as testament to the installation of an automated asteroid collection bay. In a corner off to the side, someone painted the face of an ancient dial clock with the hour and minute hands pointed straight up.

This is one of dozens, actually one of approximately 6.4 dozen, remote outpost stations scattered throughout Miriani Space. This particular station is located on the very fringe of the Local Space bubble around Sector 6, and pilots can literally haul asteroids from beyond Local Space to this collection location. The bulkheads of the landing bay are painstakingly painted in a smooth dark grey paint that seems to have an internal luminescence. The landing deck shows recent scuffs and scrapes from remote asteroid handlers as testament to the installation of an automated asteroid collection bay. In a corner off to the side, someone painted the face of an ancient dial clock with the hour and minute hands pointed straight up.

18:40 ["Pebbles" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

18:41 Pippa Lancaster
She is a member of the Hale alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This lithe woman appears to be in her early twenties and stands 5 feet and 4 inches tall with a medium bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a slightly tanned complexion. Her long, champagne blonde hair is pulled into braided pigtails. She has expressive sky blue eyes with an upturned nose above white, straight teeth.  She is drenched in cold, clear water. She appears to have adopted a normal stance.
She has a blue-violet tattoo of a supernova on her right wrist.
She is wearing glossy red lip gloss on her lips.
For a top, she is wearing a violet spacesuit top over a black cotton shirt with the words "Not Just Hale but HALE" scrawled on the back. For a bottom, she is wearing a violet spacesuit bottom over a pair of form fitting red leather short shorts and a sheer turquoise G-string with a bow on the front under that. She has a violet spacesuit helmet on her head. She is wearing a pair of violet spacesuit gloves on her hands and a pair of violet spacesuit boots on her feet. She is wearing a black leather hip belt around her waist. She is also wearing a small keyring, a compact violet Lore computer, a black spacesuit storage bag, a fuzzy black backpack with black thin straps and a black heart-shaped front pocket, a metallic gray metafrequency communication pin, a black archaeological artifact storage container, a red rolled toolkit, a delicate watch with
18:41  a gold band and a heart-shaped face, a gold ID bracelet with an open heart charm dangling from it, and an asteroid hauling kit.
She is carrying nothing.

18:54 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:54 There is nothing to see.

18:54 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:54 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:54 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

18:54 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

18:54 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:54 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:54 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

18:54 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:54 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

18:54 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:54 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

18:54 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

18:54 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:54 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Leaf Station to Autumn flight control, we're reading shots fired by a Hale starship at a Commonwealth starship!"

18:54 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

18:54 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

18:54 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:54 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:54 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:55 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:55 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

18:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

18:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:55 The six-person dart "Fascination" is located at Zander; Lukco Robotics Landing Platform.

18:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:55 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:55 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

19:54 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a blue trash can, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.

20:18 A translucent security drone

20:18 The exterior of this drone is spherical and mostly smooth. The contiguous outer shell is marred only by a number of small fins and grills, apparently intended to help the drone stay afloat or to cool the inner workings. Four smaller holes are placed at even intervals around the drone's body, presumably used for firing stun or counterstun shots. There is no evident sensory system, though a panel at the top of the drone seems to be used for the loading or unloading of ammunition.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Zander; Lukco Robotics Landing Platform.

21:20 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

21:20 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the four-person roborant "Enchanted Chaos", the eight-person gunship "Praelor Demolish Enterprize", the one-person expediter "Dragon Heart", and the three-person voyager "Road To Nowhere" landed here.
You see a sparking airlock, Yawn the droid, Mer the droid, Alphy the droid, Lose the droid, and Miracle the droid here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny sil

22:47 You peer out and see...

22:47 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the four-person roborant "Enchanted Chaos", the eight-person gunship "Praelor Demolish Enterprize", and the one-person expediter "Dragon Heart" landed here.
