Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I got in a little above 1140k."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Um 140k."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I wonder if using the
compressors is why the salvager contributions are looking all weird."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Probably."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You shouldn't use a compressor."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I totally did."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Possibly."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not during a salvage op."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I loved it."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We tested it to see what
would happen."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Now we know."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, I could've told you what
would happen, you get paid a lot less credits!"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes but it shouldn't affect
somebody getting to bring in less debris."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That is caused by somebody
bringing in more?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Lily, when Joel got his
debris in, there was like 41k left. How much did you put in the first time?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Just under 105 but I didn't see
41k available and I had about 48k and had 10k left over."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I expelled three large pieces
of iron, so I might have ended up with more pieces. But I had just under 151K
total."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hmm, I dunno. We'll watch
more carefully next time."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "So you were 7k short of 150k,
Lily?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Apparently so and I did not
compress."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo stares curiously up at you.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If she didn't use a compressor,
her debris should've been more valuable, too."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It is gonna happen, people
will miss by a thousand or two by times. But Lily got the lowest percentage
contributed. That's what we are trying to figure out."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Does that go by grade,
pieces, or what?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think the debris just
straight up degrades when it's compressed."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We used compressors on one
salvage op that I led in my time and we pretty much all decided never again."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Right so, how would
somebody with uncompressed debris get less percentagewise."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Probably dependent on the grade
of the pieces brought in with that particular case."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay."
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it
can't break the toy.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It seemed to improve the
average grade, but lower the total pay."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Probably."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not a salvage op
expert, so I tested stuff."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't forget that Lily has over
15000 points. Whatever debris she brings in, her grapple gives it a 20% grade
bonus."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Bring on the beers."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup over 18k."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, if she upgraded to the
highest mighty grapple, which I'm assuming she did."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yrp I have the 6."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That's available at 15000
industry?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a 6?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And yes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I did not know that. Our book
only goes up to the 5."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Neat."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep at 15k."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Reets only wrote what he knew
about."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "I am holding out for mighty grappler 14."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, that's definitely an
X-factor, too."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The 5 is at 8k."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I knew the 5 started at 8K. I
just didn't know there was a mighty 6."

one...or even the X. But it'll be about 20 years..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "There most definitely

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Because, it will just lure you
into an endless cycle of mindless unaccomplishment."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I said at the beginning of the op that I
was going east so what does morris do? He jumped the gun and went where I was so
I had to regroup so that slowed me down."
'Wow!
You exclaim, "Wow!"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "But I like scooping."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's ok, at least I got to participate."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, then you should be safe. As
long as you don't actually -use- your salvage grapple."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, unless you're using it
for the fusion blast chamber."

You nod to Lily Kaise. "I wish I'd gotten to, but oh well."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Sometimes I do salvage missions
for the Accord."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well defense was full even though I had
initially asked for it."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I do those often...usually...s
ometimes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even before the war, the main
reasons I tended to salvage mainly revolved around filling up my plasma cannon's
chamber with materials so that it can shoot things, and for the construction
facility."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I do it to advance my career
and to help out my alliance, mostly...not necessarily in that order. There are
things not related to industrial activities that require industry license
points."

You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "By the way, did someone
transfer out there?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Cool. Thanks."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I went to transfer and the module
was already gone."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You will go farther with
scooping! Everyone wants super valuable tritium."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Saaaaaalvage."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling, are we going out to
build a long-range chart or just something short."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Scooping is more time
intensive for equivalent license points than salvage. Plus, we need the iron,
lead, gold, and all that good stuff, too. Not just tritium."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Define long range."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Looking at 150 lightyears
maybe."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "The chart itself will be station-sized."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK, so long-range."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "We will do two leg set up.
Cartography unit and one array in home sector and two other arrays off that."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Someone else going to set up
the second array while we set up the first?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I think we could maybe get
away with using Bolt to aim between directions we want to go. Like northeast and
then have one ship go north and another east to speed up trips."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Yes I think this is plan."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I've got the HAARP charging."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I still will not be ready
for a bit yet."

You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You may not, but it takes two
hours for the HAARP to warm up."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "That is perfect timing."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Curious, don't wouldn't you
want one ship to go northeast, and the other to go like, northwest?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, and I am not responsible
for what teleportation storms might do to your vessels or how far out they might
fling you!"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Good disclaimer."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "That is fine too. Doesn't
matter much to me. Ask Akemi. So long as chart will cover local space I am
happy."
Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.
Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't see why it shouldn't."

[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No worry. I will be using
Cesar's ship probably."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So you just want me to make you
a storm and that's pretty much it?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Unless you want to come with
me on my leg."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise chuckles.

'It did.
You say, "It did."

You laugh.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I just don't want the storm to
get too far ahead of you. Which sector are you going to set up and leave from?"
squeeze lily
You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.
caress lily on back
You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I was preferring centralized
location of known space, but really map will by far cover all of that. So I am
not picky. I forget if Akemi mentioned preference."
Lily Kaise gently caresses your neck and hsoulders.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I mean, for instance,
most of our charts have old earth as the central location. So do you want to do
that for yours?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "She is making map too."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If we do what we did on the last
chart, one leg will start from a location in deep space that's near the 134th,
and the other leg will start from the Bubble."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm fairly sure that a bolt
storm can't cover both locations."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If you want it near beacons
to make things easier though, I'd suggest earth, Orion or something like that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The leg leaving from near the
134th will be the "long trip", so the Radio Bubble start location will have a
shorter trip anyway."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Earth it is."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The legs are equal distance,
just they leave from different places because we already figured out how to line
them up."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Good, good."
kiss lily on lips
You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you want to put the
mainframes near somewhere in particular, we'll want to figure out the headings
between that place and the Radio Bubble now."
Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was just working on that as
you spoke."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Old earth is west and very
slightly down of the radio bubble."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Distance?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Excellent. I would but my
chart is sadly useless."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "About 41 lightyears."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That's pretty good."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Melinda shouldn't be making charts right
now as her skill level is not that good."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "You got the figure in LTC?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "5.31 light-trade cycles, if you
really want an exact distance."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I do, thank you."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "Am I needed to do a thing?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Pierre is welcome to come as
always."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Are both vessels going to leave
on their accelerated beacon run from the Belt of Orion?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "No, one will be leaving from the
mainframe location."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK, then I suppose I can set up
two storms."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And going to the bubble right
now, you're going to need it. Flow's pretty much in your face."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The ship leaving from the Radio
Bubble has a trip that's 111 light-years long, while the other team has to cover
the full 150 light-years."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Let's see the forecast here..."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, ""Slow.""
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'll speed up slightly.
Hopefully you'll leave the region soon enough."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling, which one are you
going to take, old earth or bubble?"

Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Is there some sort of
hypercaster up at the Radio Bubble now?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I will take Old Earth."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "There is."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I think it's the high end
broadcaster."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Goodness. Why the high-end one
for the bubble?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Why not?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Use to be improved served it
well enough and gave real clear comms."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Maybe the improved. If it's
the high end, it's probably because we had a few on the ship."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Either the improved or ultra is
enough for me to get a heading to Old Earth with."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I didn't put the bubble up
so I am not really sure. I use improved as does Joel."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'll need someone hanging out by
Old Earth so I can get reports on the signal."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I will."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Right, I'll be at 287 in a
subcycle."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You want me to just go a
sector out?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Doesn't matter, we won't get the
beam that tight."

Aisling?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Never mind, I see you
jumping out."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't remember, but I think
even the broadcaster before the improved one use to give clear comm signals. It
has been too much tiiiime."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "If you are setting up home
station you will need proper mainframes. We are building two."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I can try the one before. I
don't know if that works good or not."

to do that soon."
'Awww, nice!
You exclaim, "Awww, nice!"
