12:04 [Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood king pillowtop bed)
You see nothing special.
You see a wicker dresser, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, an amethyst purple blown glass flower-shaped jasmine and white lilies scented air freshener, a rosewood king pillowtop bed, an antique teak nightstand with a neon purple lily scented candle sitting on top of it, a pair of gray sneakers with red laces, and a hologram of a tropical island projected in the middle of the room here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood king pillowtop bed) here.
You can go east and south.

12:05 You are not wearing a top. You are not wearing a bottom. You are wearing a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

12:05 You are carrying nothing.

The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.

15:14 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet medical drone, a compact black security drone, a sleek

17:33 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

17:33 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

17:33 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

17:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

17:37 ["Steelwing" Weapons Room 4] (indoors) (buckled into a brown leather crewman chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an oak wood trash bin, an internal stun turret, and a brown leather crewman chair here.
You can go northwest.

17:37 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "ok"

17:38 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:38 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:38 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:38 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:38 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:38 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:39 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:39 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:39 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:39 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:39 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:39 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:03 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.
