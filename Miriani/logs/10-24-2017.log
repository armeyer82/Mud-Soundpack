The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

20:17 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go south and out.

20:17 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom the droid, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Chops the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the dr

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

21:16 Amore Carver laughs over the intercom.

21:17 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:17 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Flames of Rage" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

21:17 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:17 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:17 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:17 Amore Carver's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "i had 52 0, you stole my kills"

21:17 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:17 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:17 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:17 Tiberius Black's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "stole is such a strong word"

21:17 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:17 Amore Carver's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "borrowed?"

21:30 [Short-range Communication] Drew Berry transmits, "Lord Drew is at your service!"

21:30 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

21:30 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Take care."

21:30 [Short-range Communication] Amore Carver transmits, "Good afternoon lord Berry."

21:30 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "thanks, you as well"

21:30 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

21:31 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Flames of Rage" has launched from Rolukssica.

21:31 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:31 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:31 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:31 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:31 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:31 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Flames of Rage" has initiated an intrasector slip.

21:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person cargo hauler "Blue Star" has entered Jumpgate to Central Jumpgate Hub.

21:32 ["Flames of Rage" Weapons Room 3] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a comfy royal blue leather combat chair here.
You can go northeast.

21:32 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:32 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Flames of Rage" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

21:32 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:32 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:32 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:32 Cria Stroup's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "300 mods"

21:32 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:32 You access a silver portable point unit and note you have 5405.32 license points and 4328.74 combat points.

21:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:32 You need 94.68 points to reach 5500.0 points. The following is a breakdown of the most basic activities:

22:35 Easter Egg Painting
--------------------------------------------------
Easter eggs are fun and exciting for the whole family!

To get started, you will need two things: An egg to paint and canisters of paint. Once you obtain them, decorate them with the following commands:

PAINT EGG WITH <canister>

You will be prompted with two (as of writing) options: Mix and paint. If you choose the option to paint, it will put a small layer of that paint on the egg. If you want the intensity of the color to be stronger, paint it again. After you paint your egg with several colors, you can begin mixing them into different patterns. When you choose the mix option, it will ask you for a style and then ask you to select available colors for mixing. After you've chosen your colors, hit 0 to indicate that you're done. That's it!

23:56 ["Pop Goes The Prailer" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white tiled floor. You see a polished circular mirror in a smooth ebony frame carved with vines and a wooden frame containing a picture of Ralph the Monkey triumphantly holding up a banana hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
