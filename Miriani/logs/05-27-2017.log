00:46 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: Ok. So I have a question. I've been to the blueprint simulation machine on Pax. And I've viewed the place. But I'm unable to see where, exactly, this place might be located. Does anybody have a suggestion as to how that information might be obtained? I mean, am I missing something here?

00:46 #$#hjelp

00:47 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: Like, in case where it's located would affect whether or not I wanted to buy it.

00:47 [Newbie] Stanton Sefdon: Type menu in the room with the sim.

00:47 [Newbie] Jason Harkness: Use the menu in the room, it should say in the information if it's there. Otherwise there should be a lookup feature.

00:50 #$#hjelp

00:51 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: Before I make a report, if you type menu in this room and instead of getting it narrowed down, you receive what appears to be the entire list of all the properties, or at least, a large majority of them, have I done something wrong, or is it actually supposed to narrow it down to a short list off things that might match? I mean I typed the name just as it appeared when I was in the sim, so spelling is not an issue. Plus I did it twice. Suggestions would be great!

00:52 [Newbie] Alycen Hunter: It did that to me too. I think it's a bug to be reported.
