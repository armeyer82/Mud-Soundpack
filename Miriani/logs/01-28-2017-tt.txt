Orion, and Accord."

different mixes of modules. Or both."

making a concerted effort in their tiny mechanical minds to take something in an
area because they might have a vested interest in it. Who can know."

on Storyteller."

pirate! Could've been someone else on other business. In future, you can always
buy an FTL drive tracer for your ships or craft them (if you're able to). That
way, you can track down a vessel and find out what it might actually be long as
it stays within our beacon network."
[Tactical Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "Cool."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Thanks for the advice."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "And if you can't trace them, you

Sometimes it could be an unregistered, and not all of them are hostile."

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Subject: New Allied Pirate tactics
Author: Ather Jammoa
Posted: 16:34 28 January 2317 GST

Note: this post was shared by Akemi Bando, the League Space Defense captain as
of the writing of this message. This post has to do with the Allied Pirates and
their attack on the Belt of Orion on the morning of January 28, 2317 using bolt
throwers. Please read carefully.
The Allied Pirates tried a new trick earlier today. They're going in for a mixed
arms doctrine, supporting their fighting ships with RDT-E2M5 Bolt Thrower
corvettes, the ones made by Revo Developmental Technologies. They're putting
those ships in the hands of some of their best pilots. As a quick reminder, the
RDT-E2M5 is a two person ship armed with light weapons and a bolt cannon only.
They're under-armed compared to most other corvette designs, with two light
turrets run by the control room, and three light turrets run by the weapons
room. The control room gets the bolt cannon as well, and the pirates were armed
with both disabling bolts and disarming bolts.
Bolts can hit with good accuracy from great distance, so they do not need to be
right next to you to score a hit. Disarming bolts will wreck your weapons and
have a good chance of temporarily disabling them, just like a lucky shot with
other weapons can. Disabling bolts will smash up your FTL drive and will have a
good chance of making your reactionless engine sieze up for a few seconds. A
siezed up drive will be able to move you around at half speed at least, but your
chances of evading locks from other ships go way down as a result.
The way the Allied Pirates used the bolt throwers is exactly the way I would
want them used if I had one supporting my ship: they held back, used their range
advantage to be annoying, and would run whenever we approached them. It is
possible to catch up to them and stay on them with a very fast ship, and you can
even land hits if you have a crack gunner, but for the most part it's a wild
goose chase.
We did manage to use light corvettes, which have the Mars reactionless overdrive
system (a.k.a. the afterburner), to catch up to them and damage some of the bolt
throwers enough to make them rout. However, the pirates seem to have a good
supply of them since they were cycling in fresh bolt throwers as needed. The
strategy that ultimately works when the pirates do this is to have small, fast,
ships chase the bolt throwers away. They may not engage them properly or damage
them much, but just keeping the pressure up on the enemy is enough to allow a
bigger combat ship to engage the Allied Pirate warships without constantly
getting pelted by bolts. Once the bigger ships are gone, the bolt throwers will
bug out.
The small ships you use can be anything: light corvettes, fighters, wasps from a
Morningstar, whatever is fast enough to keep up with the bolt throwers and agile
enough to avoid getting pasted by everything else in the fight.

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Attention pilots: it has been brought to
my attention that there was a major attack conducted by Mr. Kelsey's allied
pirates over the Belt of Orion early this morning. The attackers used several
larger vessels, as well as Bolt Throwers to drive off the civilian pilots that
attempted to fight it off. What is truly concerning is the lack of willingness
from members of our own corps who were active at the time, but did not crew. Let
me emphasize that no matter what you're up to, if any sectors get invaded by
obvious threats, you should drop what you're doing and volunteer for a crew
spot. The AEU once was one of the most active alliances for fighting off
invasions. To not even volunteer to crew, even if you're for some reason
incapable of combat piloting, is completely stupid. In future, I expect to see a
good AEU showing when fighting off an invasion, or as good as we can get it
under the current circumstances. I don't want to hear about pilots turning off
their comms again seconds after an invasion was announced and a request for
crewing went out just because they might not wish to crew. This is our space
too! Let's defend it. A copy of this comm notice will go on our alliance boards
with additional information, but I wanted to make sure you all read it here
first. [16:21 28 January 2317 GST]
