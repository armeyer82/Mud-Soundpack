["Final Sight" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a small flat disc containing the image of "Resounding Honor" Cafeteria, a small flat disc containing the image of a case of Krenelia art, a small flat disc containing the image of Pax; Conference Room, a small flat disc containing the image of "Resounding Honor" Control Room, a small flat disc containing the image of "Resounding Honor" Armory, a small flat disc containing the image of "Resounding Honor" Auxiliary Flight Bay, a small flat disc containing the image of Orelor Znalkgana Outpost; Human-Praelor Docking Bay, a large wooden frame containing a canvas titled "Crossfire", and a small flat disc containing the image of Buck Ley hanging on the wall.

12:08 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

12:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:11 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:11 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:15 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

12:15 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:15 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

12:15 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:16 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

12:16 You're already sitting down.

12:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:16 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:16 You're already sitting down.

12:16 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:16 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:16 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:16 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

12:16 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:16 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:16 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:16 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:16 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:16 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

12:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:17 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

12:51 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

12:51 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

12:51 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:51 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:51 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

12:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.
For a top, you are wearing a gold vest with 'Force' embroidered on the left breast over a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet.

You are carrying a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in your right hand.

12:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:52 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:52 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

14:53 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:53 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:53 You stand up.

14:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:53 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

14:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:53 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:53 You stand up.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a; Docking Bay.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table.

17:06 Tom Tucker's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "But nah. My old robo got blown up by a muzano otona combo, after they finished with my previous dart's incarnation. Needless to say, I was sad for days"

17:06 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush brown carpet. You see a shiny gold ship plaque and a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the green tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

17:42 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:42 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:42 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:42 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:42 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

17:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

17:43 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:43 Ray Ridgeway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Thanks for having me Tom, I hope you will find my gunning to be...acceptible. Cally will tell you, sadly, I can not gun, but, for today, I'll pretend otherwise."

17:43 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:43 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:43 Tom Tucker chuckles over the intercom.

17:43 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:43 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

17:44 ["Furmoria" Weapons Room 2] (indoors) (sitting on a tall aqua gunner's chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush brown carpet. You see a shiny gold ship plaque and a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the green tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a tall aqua gunner's chair and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, southwest, and west.

Standard equipment includes: Class 7 solar charging array, enhanced sensor array, planetary survey scanners, class 10 hull plating with battlecruiser hardening, an enhanced relativity drive, an alliance specialty subwarp drive, a Galactic Map Unit, a navigational automatic vector interface, and an intrasystem slip drive. To accomodate the power system necessarily to drive the technology available, the Dart does suffer from slightly slower drive recharge times and a moderately weakened laser power system. To compensate, the Griffin Research Laboratory released an upgrade called a laser overdrive capacitor, a piece of technology that will feed energy wasted during NAVI transit and store it in a buffer. Once the buffer is 10% or fuller, the starship's laser array will be able to draw energy from the buffer to amplify their diminished firepower, bringing it on par with standard defensive equipment."

18:25 ["Tibo" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

Starship Weapons
--------------------------------------------------
  Laser Turrets
Laser turrets are small turrets mounted on the hull that focus energy into an amplified beam of light in order to cause damage to a target. 

Pros:
Can fire without confirming a target.
Usually abundant on most ships.

Cons:
Begin to lose effectiveness the more they are damaged.
Require a fair amount of starship charge to fire.
Can be reflected back at you if the target has laser reflectors.


  Bardenium Cannons
Bardenium Cannons are small launchers along the starship's hull that, when activated, fire a chunk of charged bardenium at a target. The damage done by bardenium cannons is dependant on the type of bardenium being fired as well as the physical mechanism required to launch the bardenium.

Pros:
50% chance of doing hull damage.
Require less power to fire.
Aren't reduced in capacity by damage.

Cons:
Require reloading with ammunition.

Pro/Con:
Require confirming a target before they fire.

  Computer Disruption Pulse
The CDP fires a carefully modulated energy pulse at an enemy starship which will temporarily disrupt certain computers aboard the target starship. The primarily affected function is autopilot. While all ship classes are different, the majority of the time the CDP will cause sluggish response in starship autopilot and can even disable it entirely. The effects are only temporary and the initial 
19:22 pulse does require quite a bit of power, but it's nonetheless an effective weapon against ISC designed ships. The CDP is effective at ranges up to four units and requires six minutes to recharge, drawing power from the ship's main battery. Note that the weapon is not always effective. Under certain circumstances, it will fail to have an effect. This is always the case when using it against biological technology.

Range: 4 units
Recharge Time: 6 minutes
Effect: Slow down autopilot functions.
Usage: DISRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.

  Disarmament Pulse
The DP is a pulse weapon that will fire a burst of energy at an enemy starship that specifically targets (conventional) weapons.

Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 60 seconds
Effect: Causes small amounts of damage to one or more weapon systems on the target starship.
Usage: DISARM. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.

  Sensor Interruption Pulse
The sensor interruption pulse fires a directed burst of energy that's specifically modulated to cause damage to only a starship's sensor array.

Starship Weapons
--------------------------------------------------
  Laser Turrets
Laser turrets are small turrets mounted on the hull that focus energy into an amplified beam of light in order to cause damage to a target. 

Pros:
Can fire without confirming a target.
Usually abundant on most ships.

Cons:
Begin to lose effectiveness the more they are damaged.
Require a fair amount of starship charge to fire.
Can be reflected back at you if the target has laser reflectors.


  Bardenium Cannons
Bardenium Cannons are small launchers along the starship's hull that, when activated, fire a chunk of charged bardenium at a target. The damage done by bardenium cannons is dependant on the type of bardenium being fired as well as the physical mechanism required to launch the bardenium.

Pros:
50% chance of doing hull damage.
Require less power to fire.
Aren't reduced in capacity by damage.

Cons:
Require reloading with ammunition.

Pro/Con:
Require confirming a target before they fire.

  Computer Disruption Pulse
The CDP fires a carefully modulated energy pulse at an enemy starship which will temporarily disrupt certain computers aboard the target starship. The primarily affected function is autopilot. While all ship classes are different, the majority of the time the CDP will cause sluggish response in starship autopilot and can even disable it entirely. The effects are only temporary and the initial pulse does require quite a bit of power, but it's nonetheless an effective weapon against ISC designed ships. The CDP is effective at ranges up to four units and requires six minutes to recharge, drawing power from the ship's main battery. Note that the weapon is not always effective. Under certain circumstances, it will fail to have an effect. This is always the case when using it against biological technology.

Range: 4 units
Recharge Time: 6 minutes
Effect: Slow down autopilot functions.
Usage: DISRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.

  Disarmament Pulse
The DP is a pulse weapon that will fire a burst of energy at an enemy starship that specifically targets (conventional) weapons.

Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 60 seconds
Effect: Causes small amounts of damage to one or more weapon systems on the target starship.
Usage: DISARM. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.

  Sensor Interruption Pulse
The sensor interruption pulse fires a directed burst of energy that's specifically modulated to cause damage to only a starship's sensor array.

Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 1 minute
Effect: Causes a small amount of damage to the target starship's sensor array.
Usage: INTERRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.

  Immobilization Pulse
The IP is a pulse weapon that, similar to the DP, will target only a ship's wormhole drive with the intent of immob
19:29 ilizing a target without the use of interdictors.

Range: 1 unit

  Autolocking Long-range Laser
Usage: LRL
