Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Approximately 2.66 LTC from when we repaired the Rift Drive, we discovered
Nebular Signature 5696-1195 West and very slightly down.
The energetic riftstorm was still in sight and we had to travel within 1.65 lTC
of the riftstorm to access Nebular Signature 5696-1195.
Earthgate NDB signal was faint at 30 percent and the XL NDB signal from The
Torus was fairly loud at 79 percent
Luminosity was slightly dim
Debris grade was 80
A Planetary Survey was executed yielding no planets.
Space Imaging photograph was obtained and placed in the holding box.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small white trash can, a clear
plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers,
and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

In deed, not a bad idea, but as was said already implemented, sort of. Might be

'Doc' Anatolius Stavros of the Mutuality is one who can do surgery. However,
just be warned, what you may ask for isn't exactly what you will get. If you're
looking for a boob job, you'll probably end up with space gorilla breasts or
something. That is if you're lucky!

So I was thinking, with the amount of people that breed felo, and the fact that
you can really only carry 2 things at once, it would be awesome if you could buy
a felo carrier from somewhere. That way, you could move many more of them at
once if it's what you need to do.

The taxidermy shop sells a very stylish pet carrier. I don't think you can put
felo in it though. At least, not living ones.

Thinking realistically of a cat-sized animal and even larger with the soldiers,
you're not going to fit more than one in a pet carrier. So you're just going to
be stuck carrying two pet carriers.

Maybe a home felo cryopreservation device would be good. Stick a felo in there,
turn them into felo-pops, defrost them later when you are ready.

Not sure if serious!
If you are, perhaps the SPCF needs to get involved again. People keep forgetting
in that these are animals, not equipment to be used when convenient. The whole
idea is that it is slighty inconvenient to keep them if you're not just keeping
them as pets.
If you don't want to keep a bunch of felo, don't keep a bunch of felo. There are
plenty of people out there who have extras should you ever need to get one or
two in an emergency. Otherwise, you need to put up with what they entail.

Well, I am curious as to what would happen to one's felo if you entered a
cryotube with it...
Although, were our actions not limited by code, a felo carrier would be
relatively easy to jury-rig. Just stick a bunch of boxes on a hoverpallet and
put the felo in the boxes.

Personally, I think a felo carrier might be handy. there are times you have to
move a lot of felo from one ship to another. I've seen buggies for dogs, similar
in size to the ones for babies. I suppose leaving your felo too long inside one
would be bad, similar to the fact that your felo can't eat while wearing their
spacesuits.

He appears to be 26 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has
olive skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has
average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is average-shaped and
handsome, with a broad nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and tan and
occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His ear-length, straight hair is
blonde and neatly trimmed over the ears and parted on the side. He has large
brownish fingernails.
 He is wearing a white shipsuit with gold trim around the collar and cuffs and a
pair of light brown leather boots decorated with silver stars. He is also
wearing a keychain, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic silver metachannel FTL
communicator, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a black guitar
case. His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

A Tardick lizard named Raissa settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes
close slowly and it appears to sleep.
Kim Saunders flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control
board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Blake Madison closes a black engineering tool case.
Kim Saunders sits down on a black leather sectional sofa.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
Morris Corlew rubs a Tardick lizard named Raissa for some reason.
Simon Collins says in an English accent, "Sorry about missing external repsm I
was doazing then and by the time I realized you were doing reps the airlock was
cycled already."
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

I see no "lily" here.
Kim Saunders says to Simon, "It's ok, you still came to help inside."
Melinda Michaels says to Kim Saunders, "So, what's this with escape pods being
launched under 10% charge?"
Morris Corlew chuckles. "Hope we make a good dinner and don't give the rift
entities indigestion."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Oh holy hell that wouldn't be
good."
Kim Saunders says to Melinda Michaels, "According to akemi, once the ship has
less than 10 percent charge, it becomes possible to launch it's escape pod,
similar to when you'd vent the atmosphere."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yes, possible but it doesn't do it
automatically."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Please don't tell it to do it."
Morris says to Kim Saunders, "So they don't launch at 10%, they just prepare."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Not that we have any crazy crew
members on board during this trip who would just do such a thing for... fun
though."
Melinda says to Akemi in a Bedford accent, "I will get right on that."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo wanders in from the southeast.
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo wanders out.
Melinda loks at the big button and then grins at Akemi.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I never said automatically, if it
sounded like that, I'm sorry."
Morris Corlew chuckles at Melinda Michaels.
Melinda says to Kim, "Yeah, that's what I was going, what for."
Zandria Marschaund strokes the soft fur of Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed
felo.
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo purrs softly.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "160 light-years to Earthgate. We've got
over 4 cycles of charge, and whatever's left on the furnace. I think we'll be
fine."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Should be."
Kim Saunders nods. "Yeah, unless the flow turns truly in our face, we should
make it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And then I'm sure we can come up
with a few energy conserving methods."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Felo in Kim's ship."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "We'd move the pets to your gemini and
shut down the luxuries like air and artificial gravity."
Kim Saunders nods. "Exactly."

Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "Well, that could be a problem for
the sleepers."
Kim says to Michael, "They get shoved in a bubble."
'Yeah, fun place to wake up in.
You say, "Yeah, fun place to wake up in."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "They'd end up in a safety bubble. The
biggest concern would be if they put on their pajamas or not."
Michael Winters laughs.
Zandria Marschaund nods.
Kim Saunders giggles.

You chuckle.
Kim Saunders removes a cool pint of Marzore Dark from a reflective oval coffee
table with a transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs.
Kim says to Akemi in a New Bristol accent, "We decided not to visit that site of
hostile engagement on the scanners."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Alright."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Darn, look how close we've come to
it even when not going there."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "What sort of artifacts are found in
a place like that?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Probably bubble stuff."
Akemi Bando nods to Melinda Michaels.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Maybe even locals."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ah, right."

such as the final dust and the final memories?"
Morris Corlew waves to Lily Kaise.
Kim Saunders waves to Lily Kaise.

You grin at Kim Saunders.
Kim says to you in a New Bristol accent, "Also good waking cycle to you, by the
way."
Akemi says to Lily, "Hello, how do you do today?"
Melinda says to Morris, "There are places further out that you will find things
that aren't found in closer fields."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Remote artifacts would be a bit farther
out yeah. So far I haven't found any."
Akemi says to Morris, "Once I found a weird crystal thing."
Morris Corlew nods. "Ah ok."
smile kim 'Thanks, you too.
You smile at Kim Saunders. "Thanks, you too."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "There is a place beyond Andy's that
has remotes. I will go there sometime."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I still don't know what it does. They've
only got one or two other examples like it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I'd love to do an artifacting trip,
I really need to give my exploration a boost."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Munson's last stand has a mix of local
and alien and their alien artifacts are different from any I've seen."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "That's what I need to do."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ok, this trip will probably give it
a boost as well."

Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Sometimes you can find ceremonial knives
too."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ooh."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Suits of armor."
Morris says to Akemi, "Really?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Bits of alien power armor, deactivated
projectile weapons, all sorts of stuff."

Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Down.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "What now?"
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "As if on cue."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Just a storm."
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "Rift storm."

You say, "Rift storm."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Oh.."
Morris Corlew groans.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Astable?"
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "Astable too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "A hostile engagement site as well."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Let's see."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "The "gusty" type that seems to come and
go."
Kim Saunders nods to Lily Kaise. "We have decided not to go there."
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "Yeah, we decided to pass that up."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Oh right."
Kim says to Akemi, "Ah, right."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I'm sure it's local and probably
either already discovered and not worth much."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "So how far from comms are we?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Let's see, astable, comes and goes.
Energetic blasts you with energy and is not good, chaotic is one that rapidly
changes flow like it can't make up its mind."
Lily Kaise nods to Akemi Bando.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "When anfisa last charted, 19 ltc."
Zandria Marschaund asks in an Old Earth accent, "So is there a way to travel
around the storm?"
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Any idea of how far we went prior to the
breakdown?"
Akemi says to Zandria, "Yes."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Uhm, 1.54 I think."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Nice."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ah ok."
Akemi says to Zandria, "We can see it on the rift locations display. We're
moving away from it."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Slowly."
Blake Madison removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly
into a white flightbag.
Zandria Marschaund nods.
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo wanders in from the airlock.

You stroke the soft feathers of Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo.
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo purrs softly.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If we are lucky, we will miss this
storm."
Kim says to Akemi, "I asked everyone else before, how they have liked this trip
and whether there are things I need to learn for organizing more trips in the
future. Any thoughts on that?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We're over 2 LTC away from it and it's
West Northwest so I feel certain we'll avoid this one."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Akemi says to Kim, "Nothing you're not already aware of, I think."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I personally feel I need too much
time to make up my mind on things."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "But that might be my lack of
experience."
Melinda says to Kim, "That will lessen with experience."
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo rubs up against Maggie the hefty
indigo feathered felo, and both animals purr softly.
Kim says to Akemi, "And I once again want to appologize for taking your ship in
to that pre-stellar when you really didn't want to. I don't regret it, I think
it ultimately gave us back the confidence in the ship we needed, but I don't
take going against the wishes of the ship's captain lightly."
Akemi Bando shrugs. "It was either go along with it or throw you out."
Melinda Michaels laughs. "You don't want to know what I would have done."
Melinda Michaels grins at Kim Saunders.
chuckle melinda
You chuckle at Melinda Michaels.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "You could have just put the ship
back on course for home."
Kim Saunders giggles.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Not really."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Why not?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Because the tention would have been
strained the rest of the way home."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "She either had to go with it or pod
you home."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Or I am just being a smart ass. Take
your pick."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "There was a lot of tention already.
But if akemi had put us back on course, I really would not have fought her."

You grin at Melinda Michaels.
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo wanders southeast.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Well."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "You should know me by now that I'm
not the type of person who goes against what someone wants no matter what."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "It would have hindered the crew.
Like."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "This is Kim's trip but Akemi just
overrode her and changed course from Kim's initial override of decision. So, who
do we listen to?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "So, Akemi either had to go along
with the decision or take a firm stand. Like pod with you."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Akemi. I certainly would have."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "See what I mean though?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I see."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "That may not have been the case but,
if you are on that line of logic, it is valid."

Nathaniel Owens suddenly awakens.
wave nathaniel
You wave to Nathaniel Owens.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "What I saw at the time was this.
Akemi was worried about her ship to the point that it made her so quiet like
I've never seen her, and it was not having a good effect on the crew. It's the
only time I went against anything akemi really wanted."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I know."
Kim Saunders smiles at Nathaniel Owens. "Welcome back with us."
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Nobody made wrong decisions. Like
Nissi said, you can't argue against being safe. However she worded that."
Nathaniel Owens waves.
Michael Winters glances down at his watch momentarily.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "You can't argue against caution."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Sure you can. There's such a thing as
being too cautious, and not trusting your equipment or crew enough."
Melinda says to Akemi, "Nope."
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "Earthgate is 50."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Gotta disagree."
Michael Winters grins.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I seem to remember people complaining
Reets would stay up for entire expeditions on his ship."
Melinda says to Akemi, "Yes."
Melinda says to Akemi, "But here's the example I gave the other day."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And I really can imagine what the
fear of your ship falling apart or blowing up around you is like, or watching
your crew unable to move and twitching."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "That'd be a symptom of him not trusting
the crew to manage the ship to his liking without him."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh lord yeah Reets rarely slept. I
honestly don't know how he did it except for when the QI clan came after us when
I was the only one awake and finally Berry woke up but I couldn't get Reets to
budge when needed his assistance the most."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Melinda says to Akemi, "Let's suppose that you weren't careful and kept going.
It could have been fine or, something like this. Somebody gets very ill from the
shocks or something major goes wrong with the ship. Then somebody would have
complained and said she should have gone home. So, you can't please everybody
and there is nothing wrong with being careful. We just don't know what will or
won't happen."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders nods.
Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.
nod 'But that's part of life. We never know what will or won't happen.
"But that's part of life." You nod. "We never know what will or won't happen."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I would have turned around if I had
been awake. No doubt."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And during the first 24 hours I
would have done my best to reach home fastest speed possible."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think mostly everyone agreed with
that."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Not sure if anyone openly objected
turning back?"
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "There's always some risk in coming
out here in the first place. But when something like that happens, it adds to
it. The ongoing risk isn't what you turn around for, but when it looks like
something could have blown to pieces and you don't know what...well I can't
argue with caution there."
"I dunno for sure what I would have done." Melinda Michaels nods. "Nobody does
really till we are put in that position. I just know that I told Akemi I'd give
her support and so I did."
Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels. "Exactly."
Kim Saunders nods. "And we all need support during difficult times."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I think a few people were grumpy
about it, but if anyone had really objected that much, I'd hope they would
actually come out and say it."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Maybe once we saw that everybody was
fine, we could then try stopping at objects. But, yeah nobody was wrong in this
case. At least, that's my opinion."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "What made me change my viewpoint was
the fact that 48 hours had gone by without any incident. We did recharge and
salvage and all that and everything worked. And than nissi came in and said that
she once went on with systems not functioning all together. Add to it that most
people felt pretty demoralized by the lack of speed and the entire situation."
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo wanders southwest.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Actually Anfisa said that but yeah and
maybe Nissi too."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The thing is."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Their ship was damaged."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Nod."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "But was anybody doing the twitchie
dance?"
Kim says to Akemi, "You can trust me that doing the opposite from what you
decided to do was the hardest decision I have ever made."
Kim says to Melinda, "I don't know."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "When possible harm to our persons is
added into the mix, I am not gonna fault anybody for whatever choice they make."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "That's all."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I know that story. No one had been
zapped, though they had plenty of other difficulties."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.
Melinda Michaels nods to Akemi Bando.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I wonder how the people of that ship
felt when they found the plant at the aquarium. I once read that thing grew in
their ship, they couldn't remove it, and they didn't know what it was or whether
it could harm them."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We freaked out."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "They pointed fingers at each other."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It's been a while since I read the
book on that expedition."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I think the fingerpoi."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "As for reets staying up for an
entire expedition? That is seriously unhealthy."
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo wanders in from the southwest.

You stroke the soft feathers of Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo.
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo purrs softly.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The finger pointing was at whomever
left it in the airlock. Thank goodness that it turned out to be a good thing."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "There's a reason why I find my bunk
at night. So that when I am awake, I can think clearly enough about decision
that need to be made."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well he didn't for the entire but he
would always be dozing if he wasn't awake and roaming the decks hunting people
down who violated his rules."
nod kim
You nod to Kim Saunders.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Morris Corlew gasps at Lily Kaise. "Wow."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I just remember Tristan and I going
to go have a look around while everybody was sleeping. We saw that plant in
there and couldn't move it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I remember a short trip where he was
lying in his sleeping bag and trying to sleep but every time something was said
he woke up."
Melinda Michaels nods to Kim Saunders.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am having a hard time imagining
how some people manage to sleep in here as much as they do."
Kim says to Melinda, "Yeah, that's worth freaking out."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "There is another pilot who probably
will try to stay awake more than he or she needs to but I won't say the name."
"I've said before, I'm not a fan of sleeping in public." Morris Corlew nods to
Kim Saunders. "Generally, if I can help it, I find my bunk or something."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Everyone has their own way of doing
things."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Doesn't make it good or right."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "When we went to put up the station
for the nebula mission ship."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "After a couple of days, I ordered
Annie to a bunk for rest."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "She said later, I said, no right
now. Out."
"I know I've typically stayed in teh control room and dozed with one eye open
pretty much." Lily Kaise winks at you. "I don't as much lately though."
Lily Kaise grins.
grin lily
You grin at Lily Kaise.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "There is a reason you have a crew on
a ship."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think the conclusion is, you can
only know whether a decision was wrong or right when you get home, or when
something really bad happens. Otherwise, you just do your best to make the best
possible decisions with the information available to you at the time."

You nod to Kim Saunders.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Hindsight's easy."
Kim Saunders nods.
Melinda Michaels nods to Akemi Bando.
Morris Corlew nods.

You nod to Akemi Bando.
Melinda says to Akemi, "You did what you felt you needed to do at the time.
Nobody can fault you for that."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I certainly don't fault akemi for
that."
Lillian Hudson takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.
Melinda says to Lillian in a Bedford accent, "Hi there."
Lillian Hudson kisses Melinda Michaels on the nose.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Anyway I'll get this ship checked out,
however long that takes, take care of whatever's piled up without us, and get
ready for another trip out."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Hi."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The lesson that I have learned from
this though is to try and be more careful. Ask people what they think and give
it some time to see if anybody is hurt."
Nathaniel Owens slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and goes to
sleep.
Melinda Michaels kisses Lillian Hudson on the nose.
Melinda Michaels pats Nathaniel Owens on the back.
Akemi says to Melinda, "Still want to do that Aquarium chart?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It was you and Nissi talking the most
about it, I think."
Melinda Michaels points at Lillian Hudson.
Melinda says to Akemi, "And her."
Lillian says to Akemi, "Yes. I'd like someone to do that aquarium chart, but I
think we're holding off on it for a couple months. Too many trips in too short a
time."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, choosing your crew with some
care, with a good balance of experienced pilots and new pilots. And then, once
you have chosen your crew, trust their instincts and include that in your
decision making. A very good lesson."
Lillian Hudson nods to Kim Saunders and smiles.
Lillian Hudson takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.
Melinda says to Akemi, "Lillian's going on vacation in July, I think."
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo rubs up against a reflective oval coffee

purring softly.

You wave to Lillian Hudson.
Simon Collins asks in an English accent, "Why does it matter how many trips and
how fare between they are?"
Lillian says to Melinda, "I'm not sure if I ever asked you. Did you wind up
attempting to make a chart?"
Lillian Hudson waves to you.
Simon Collins says in an English accent, "Far between that is."
Melinda says to Lillian in a Bedford accent, "Yes, I made two. Where have you
been?"
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Akemi says to Simon, "Mostly it matters for how your crew do."
The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.
Lillian says to Simon, "The governments don't like us staying away too long.
We're supposed to continue to bring back resources and help defend space.
Essentially, exploration is good if we find things, but it takes a hell of a lot
of time away from us being productive."
Kim says to Simon, "Well, I love exploring, but after each trip I really want to
spend a bit of time at home."
Melinda says to Akemi, "But yeah, we still want to do the chart."
Lillian says to Melinda, "That's what I thought, but I never heard what the
results were."
Michael Winters asks in a Candelaria accent, "So when will the next trip
actually be?"
Akemi says to Simon, "I wouldn't have taken a crew with new people out for any
longer than this one. 13 days is plenty to see if any problems crop up with new
crew members. Often 3 days is enough to see if someone's going to be able to
handle it, actually."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And then there are plenty of people
who all want to organize stuff, we can't do it all at once."
Lillian says to Michael, "Keegan's got one scheduled for July eighth, or
somewhere around there. I think I'm going to try and run mine in September."
Morris Corlew nods. "I have enjoyed this, but am itching to actually get some

Simon Collins asks, OOCly, "So is there actually an ooc mechanic that limmits
them or what?"
Michael Winters nods.
Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "No."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I've been trying to organize a trip
since before the end of last year and not looking as though I'll get it going as
I keep getting pre-empted. It's good that people want to explore though."
Melinda says to Lillian in a Bedford accent, "My first one was a few weeks. So,
if we want one that l last longer, we need to get Nissi or Anfisa."
Kim says to Lily, "Do what I did. You now know keegan has one in july, Lillian
is aiming for october. So aim for january and let people know."
Lillian Hudson says, OOCly, "Not really, but as a rule, sitting around and not
blowing things up tends to make people really bored. I know I'd like to be able
to get the rest of my points up every now and then, as fun as expeditions are.
And if it became too much of a problem, there may be an event that forces us to
come home and stay home for a bit."
Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo stares curiously up at Simon Collins.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And we have had times where 2 trips
were out at the same time."
Michael says to Lillian, "I'll most likely join yours."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "We had that happen here."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Actually it was more like four ships out
at once."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "I was about to say."
Lillian Hudson nods to Michael Winters.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Ours, Cilah's, Nicolette's, Damien's."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Not all of them had a full crew
though."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Full as in, 14 to 16 people."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "No, Nicolette and Damien were both
running solo I think."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Mine will be atwo trip expedition.
We'll take a small crew out to set up the charting stations, then come back
about a month later and do the actual trip."
Simon Collins says in an English accent, "Too bad that I'll likely need to take
myself off kegan's crew for that trip in july..."
Akemi says to Lillian, "You'll need to plan based on how long you want your
chart to last."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Hopefully we're not taking things
from the aquarium too quickly. I know we've talked about that before, but I
still worry since we haven't done an actual scientific study on it."
Akemi says to Simon, "Why's that?"
Lillian Hudson nods to Akemi Bando.
Kim says to Simon, "Basicly, balance is the key with everything. If you spend
your entire life doing nothing but mining, it will become boring as hell after a
while. All day long space combat all the time will wear you out too."
Lillian says to Kim, "Unless you're Cesar."
Lillian Hudson grins.
chuckle lillian
You chuckle at Lillian Hudson.
Simon says to Akemi, "A lot of things came up that need to be done in exactly
that time frame and I might not be able to resckedule them."
Melinda says to Lillian, "I think Akemi had an easier set up for the chart
stations but I can't remember her suggestion now."
Melinda Michaels chuckles.
Simon Collins asks in an English accent, "What does a chart station do?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It allows us to make temporary
starcharts."
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "You have three observatory stations.
Then a mainframe or two. The observatories observe and send calculations to the
mainframe. Then, after some time, you use the calculations at the mainframe to
create a temporary chart."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "A chart array is a set of stations that
observe celestial movements and project based on that information and a bunch of
astronomy tricks with a big specialized mainframe."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The size and quality of the chart also
depends on the skill of the charter as well."
Nathaniel Owens suddenly awakens.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It'd be a total waste to give me data
from a quantum mainframe, for instance. I'd just turn out something that isn't
all that it could have been."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yeah, mine was 25 LTC's but the
longevity of the chart wasn't so good."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Give the same data to Anfisa, and she
could make a really great chart."
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
updraft.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I could probably get one to last a
month if I stretched it out as far as the station lifespan would allow."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah the chart I had was good for about
8 months and it covered over 48 LTC."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That's a pretty decent chart I would
think."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Uh yeah since the one that Melinda has
is 40."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But mine isn't temp."
Kim says to Melinda in a New Bristol accent, "So can you chart in this area?"
Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.
Melinda says to Kim in a Bedford accent, "Yes."
Akemi says to Lily, "That same data produced charts that were 39 and 42 LTC in
size by Pierre and Cheri, respectively."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Something like that, anyway."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I don't know what Gray did with his."
Lillian Hudson asks in an Old Earth accent, "I wonder what kind of chart Aisling
could produce?"
Lillian Hudson takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "One that none of us can read."
Melinda Michaels giggles.
Lillian Hudson laughs. "True."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Anfisa could. Maybe Cesar will be able
to someday."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I wonder if she created a chart for
him."
Lillian Hudson finishes off a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.
Lillian Hudson forcefully hurls a cup at a shiny yellow trash bin.
It falls inside.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Oh, yeah, I heard aisling can read
those charts like the one that helped us find aria VII, what was that called
again."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup, she can."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Is that the only one she can read?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Pre-diaspora notation is what it's
called, I think. Or maybe just diaspora notation."
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo rubs up against a rare black EAOSian
contoured couch, purring softly.
Nathaniel Owens slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and goes to
sleep.
Melinda says to Kim, "She can read spinward but is a bit slow with it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think on the holovid they said the
aria vii colony was founded during a diaspora era, or something like that."
Nathaniel Owens suddenly awakens.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "You know, I really want to see Aria
vii with my own eyes, I still haven't."
Melinda says to Kim, "I will takey ou there when we go home."
Nathaniel Owens slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and goes to
sleep.
Kim Saunders exclaims in a New Bristol accent, "Cool!"
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Maybe a few more people want to see

A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

the ship because of the flares."

You nod to Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "Just thought about something. Do you
need a jet on your suit?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "As long as you stay suited up, it's no

Simon Collins asks in an English accent, "What sort of station is this and where
is it?"

You chuckle and grin at Akemi Bando.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's not a station. It is a planet where
the first colonists landed and unfortunately, they all died out due to the solar
flares on the planet."
Kim says to Simon in a New Bristol accent, "Aria vii is a planet. The original
New Earth."
Simon says to Akemi, "But but but... sunbathing is awesome..."
Simon Collins laughs.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "When we went out there with Aisling,
she was removing her helmet and dancing around."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Oh hell no? Really?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."

because of the flares.
You say to Simon, "We had a couple of pilots come back needing serious medical

Nathaniel Owens asks in a Candelarian accent, "What is the point of going

where the first pilots traveled to. It's not for everyone obviously."
Simon says to Nathaniel, "Same."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Like I said, that planet was the
original New Earth. But then the colony died out and for a very long time no one
knew what happened with it, so Omega VIII became the New Earth we know today."
Nathaniel says to Lily, "I want to see."

Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "No beacon network."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "So they did everything the harder way."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Then the crews spent lots of time

"I've done about 5 in one day I think." Morris Corlew nods. "I actually hit 9
for a period once. Oops?"
Sakura Arakida snorts at Morris Corlew.

You nod.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes
close slowly and it appears to sleep.
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "That's way more than I have now, so
I'm happy."
-morris And asteroid mining isn't bad for credits either.
You say to Morris, "And asteroid mining isn't bad for credits either."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "So, then the pictures, we have a
total of 16. Assuming they are all of new areas, they will pay pretty decent to
amazing as well, what did akemi say again? 1 bilion for the pulsar even before
we found the planet?"
'Something like that.
You say, "Something like that."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Roid mining is my main way of credit
making. Though I need to spend a few days at 134 to get a good chunk of shipreck
parts and points."
Morris Corlew nods to you. "I was going to go out with Caleb at one point, but
at the time I was still a cadet and didn't have enough industry for the kit."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "That is after expelling the larger
shipreck parts, control boards, twisted steel and sensor components."
-morris No, that's asteroid hauling. I was talking about asteroid mining.
You say to Morris, "No, that's asteroid hauling. I was talking about asteroid
mining."
Kim says to Sakura, "Do your daily missions from SVP or if you are past that,
accord."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "When you achieve 1000 Exploration, you
will earn 250 mil per planet discovery."
-morris You don't need a kit for asteroid mining.
You say to Morris, "You don't need a kit for asteroid mining."
Morris says to you in an Old Earth accent, "'oh yeah you did. Sorry..."

I don't see that here.
Sakura Arakida nods to Kim Saunders.

Sakura says to Kim, "She did say a bill yeah."
You grin at Morris Corlew. "No worries."
Morris Corlew grins at you. "Guess I need to clean my ears out."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "So, this trip easily earned me 2.5
bilion since I was awake for a lot of this stuff."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Most I've ever earned for a period
of 13 days while sitting still."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not sure if what you earn from the space

Still, you will earn some good credits and some exploration points from this
trip."

"Even more than the credits."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I really want an exploration ship of
my own some day."
Nathaniel Owens suddenly awakens.
'Me too
You say, "Me too."
'I want a tac platform with long range sightseers.
You say, "I want a tac platform with long range sightseers."
Lily says to Kim, "Build up a platform and of course our Exploration Scout is
very good."
Kim says to Akemi, "Not that I don't appreciate you offering your lovely ship
for this trip, but doesn't every explorer want their own ship?"
Kim says to Lily, "I have an exploration scout."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And I don't yet qualify for the
sightseers."
Lily says to Kim, "Also apply for an Arrow."
Kim Saunders grins. "I certainly do not qualify for that."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Not, yet, anyway."
'I'm getting close to qualifying for the long range sightseers.
You say, "I'm getting close to qualifying for the long range sightseers."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Someday too perhaps some of us aEU will
make other discoveries to qualify for the AEU Exploration Corps."

Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "And I guess I'll be using my
Gemini."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah."

The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "For exploration, the long range
scout seriously outdoes the Gemini."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "But not sure whether the League also
has something like that."
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "I don't think we do."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Right, but some of us can't get that.
My gem is multi purpose so I'm content with it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Wow, I'm surprised you guys don't
have some sort of a scout geared towards exploration."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "We do. But it's not all that well
armed."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "That's probably the only thing
that's a disadvantage."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "How not well armed are we talking
about?"
Akemi says to Kim, "We don't have anything quite like the long range scout. Our
scouts are geared toward being able to fight and endure a lot of abuse."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "2 turrets. That's all."
'same as the sightseers.
You say, "Same as the sightseers."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I see, pity."
Sakura says to Zandria, "Up for a small GMG trip with me later this week?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah you really don't need to be that
well-armed for exploration and a Gem is not an exploration shp contrary to what
some think."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "We tend to do our exploration with
larger crews."
Zandria says to Sakura, "What for? We just went. And we both don't get the full
benefit."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "The void piercer is surely a good
exploration ship but there are 2 things I don't like about it. The price, and
the total lack of any weapons."
Zandria Marschaund nods.

You say, "Yeah, the gem doesn't have exploration grade sensor."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "So I'm really fucked until I
get enough points which will be a long long time."
Sakura Arakida looks at Zandria Marschaund and shrugs. "Valid point."
'er, sensors
You say, "Er, sensors."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "This ship here, the point requirements
aren't too tough. 1500 exploration, 3500 industry, and an approved application."
Lily says to Sakura, "A goal to set."
Lily Kaise grins.
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "Yeah, atleast your two alliances
have exploration ships."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Hmmm yeah but that's going to
take quite a while."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Anyone got a copy of the 2316 version
of league ships? I'd like to take a look at something and left mine home."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "I need something to use in the
interim if the Gem doesn't have exploration grade sensors."

Zandria Marschaund removes a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316 Edition"
from a black suede handbag covered with abstractly patterned silver studs.
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I would not let less points and
credits and no special items and artifacts stop me from visiting GMG from time
to time. You still get items that the centries drop."
Sakura says to Zandria, "For things near home, for artifacting, the gem works
well enough."
Zandria Marschaund gives a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316 Edition" to
Sakura Arakida.
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Oh hell yeah."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah and keep working on your industry."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "As for GMG, I really need to go
there again."
Akemi says to Zandria, "It's got standard-grade sensors. It's still decent for
going around and looking at things with."
Sakura says to Zandria, "Exploration sensors aren't all that needed unless you
want to go out for days, and that's left to bigger crewed ships anyway."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Well that's true."
Zandria Marschaund looks down at herself thoughtfully.
Akemi says to Zandria, "With the Fienstein battery it's got just enough range it
could do a one-way trip to Andy's."
Zandria Marschaund gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Sakura says to Akemi, "That's what my gem is running."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah you can still artifact and go to
gMG just fine in the Gem as well as take short trips to places such as Rogers."

Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "You know, a couple nights ago I

would give us a list of destinations, one of them being Feng Wo for example. The

Morris Corlew laughs at Zandria Marschaund. "I like the way you dreaem."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "You'd have a bit of a problem.

Sakura Arakida shrugs.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am really curious about that
special AEU exploration core only ship, and wonder who will be the first to get
one."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But a good long term project."
Sakura Arakida gives a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316 Edition" to
Zandria Marschaund.
Zandria Marschaund shrugs helplessly.
Lily says to Kim, "Heh probably Ather."
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "I have too many projects to work

Sakura says to Zandria, "Thanks for letting me borrow that."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "No problem."
Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels. "Yeah, me too."
Kim says to Lily, "I seriously hope not."
Zandria Marschaund puts a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316 Edition" in a

Blake Madison asks in a Candelarian accent, "What kinda rift storm is that?"
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "And ather's got everything. It sounds

Lily Kaise smiles.
Sakura Arakida removes a small black box from a dark gold canvas League gear
bag.
Sakura Arakida growls at a small black box.
Kim says to Sakura, "Gray's bolt is by far the most known, probably because he

moves and hits you. I try to move once he locks and lock and fire. 75 percent of
the time I got him. Pitty the missile skiff can't get cannons."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "To fight the beast, I first need to
get a whole lot better at being a fighter pilot. And since that is very unlikely
to happen, defeating the beast is equally unlikely for me."
Akemi says to Kim, "Practice?"

You nod to Sakura Arakida.
-sakura I'd be happy to practice with you.
You say to Sakura, "I'd be happy to practice with you."
-kim And you as wel
You say to Kim, "And you as wel."
Kim says to Akemi in a New Bristol accent, "I can fly 1 solo low fine, but as
soon as I try a second or a third, or a standard, it just wears me out and I
start making mistakes."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "The simulator is pretty good for
practicing."
Melinda Michaels says, OOCly, "Careful about the tips we give on fighting the
beast. It is a quest."

everything. I can live with that."
Sakura says to Melinda in a Japanese accent, "Does cats have the advanced sim
rented? At least, I thought there were 2 types of sims?"
Sakura says to Kim, "Very true. Very very true."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah combat flying will ever likely be
my strong suit."
Melinda says to Sakura, "We have one. I believe."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "We do. It just opens up access to some
more advanced simulated parts."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I know about the one at Accord, but
that's the only one I've ever been to."
Sakura Arakida nods to Akemi Bando.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "As long as I learn to be good at
what really matters to me, I will not complain."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I never used sims. I practiced with
beacons."
Lily Kaise nods.
Sakura Arakida looks at Zandria Marschaund thoughtfully.
Blake Madison says in a Candelarian accent, "I used a sim once with clari and
ryan, and took cara into one once to get her flying down."
Sakura says to Zandria, "You're flying my corvet in a low beacon."
Sakura says to Zandria, "And don't argue with me."
Kim says to Morris, "Next to the main one at accord is a room with a simulator
for orgs."
Blake says to Zandria, "You will be flying my wing and cruiser."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "So instead of being stuck with a fighter
that's similar to how the rental fighters are set up, you can set up a fighter
with an engine that's even better than what we have, heavy lasers, mid-range
hull plating..."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I made the mistake of creating the
wrong kind of ship in the accord sim...couldn't figure out why I couldn't fire
my weapons."
Zandria says to Sakura, "Oh yeah? I don't want to screw up your vet."

Melinda says to Blake, "No, she will fly my cruiser. She is league."
You nod.
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Blake Madison nods to Melinda Michaels.
Blake says to Melinda, "Good."
Sakura says to Zandria, "On a low you won't. And I said the same thing when mel
said I was flying her gunship in a high."
Kim says to Morris, "What type of ship did you make?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I miss the toilet art that prankster set
up in the simulator room."
chuckle akemi
You chuckle at Akemi Bando.
Kim Saunders giggles.
Zandria says to Sakura, "I know but honestly even with a low I freeze and I need
to stop that. I've been making some progress but still...my performance sucked."
"Toilet, art?" Sakura Arakida blinks.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Someone bolted a set of stainless steel
toilets around the simulators."
Sakura Arakida laughs.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Morris says to Kim, "'it was one of the two-person ships. It's been awhile. I

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Some idea of art, indeed."
Kim Saunders laughs.
Morris Corlew nods to you. "True."
Sakura Arakida looks at Zandria Marschaund thoughtfully.
Sakura says to Zandria, "I suck at explaining. I just say move when they lock,
and keep in range."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Yeah I know."
Zandria Marschaund sighs to herself.
Sakura says to Zandria, "And you won't fuck up my vett. It's able to take a
bunch of hits. Or maybe I'll let you fly a low in my gunship. With many gunners.
Stuff will die fast."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I think I might try coordinate
gunning in the sim...before I try it out with a real ship. From reading, it
sounds like it might be a little easier for me, personally."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Well that's true."
Sakura says to Zandria, "And peaches will eng."

You nod to Sakura Arakida.

flying, gunning and engineering and how to coordinate with all that in a sim."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "Been doing vector."

Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "My instinct says hit it while I can,

wait a few seconds between all shots."
-morris I've been yelled at by Lily to watch my grid too.
You say to Morris, "I've been yelled at by Lily to watch my grid too."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And then still often the grid can't
keep up, which is no surprise."

so just pace yourself."

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, definitely another 12 ltc's
before the beacon."
Kim says to Akemi, "What do you think? Is it wise to chart now or wait a bit?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Unless somebody put up a big Capital."
Lily Kaise grins.
-lily yeah, and popped the outsiders that came with it.
You say to Lily, "Yeah, and popped the outsiders that came with it."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "With the sensors on this ship, if we
approach the Radio Bubble, the temporary beacon will be visible to the
navigation computer at 3 LTC, but the stations won't show up on the passive
sensors until we're about 18 LGC from it."
Lily Kaise grins at you.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Except serving as a navigation aid,
I really don't see the advantage to a capital beacon."

Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "A little under that. 2700 is about 1 LTC
an hour."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah about as flow is not liking us at
the moment."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Could be worse though."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "So still going to take at least 12

charted."

going more upward."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Flow probably pushed us down a bit more
thn we'd have thought."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Considering Nissi once told me that
the closer you get to your destination, the more accurate the chart becomes, it
might be an idea to chart every 5 ltc or so?"
Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo wanders in from the airlock.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It's reasonable at this point. People
often do it by halves though."

Lily Kaise laughs.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yep, we are sure getting pretty
close to it."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yeah people do it differently. I

Maggie the hefty indigo feathered felo stares curiously up at Sakura Arakida.

Several snowglobes stacked vertically hover past at high speed.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "If you've been doing a decent job

Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "We've avoided storms and are aimed
okay."

around half the distance I initially set and then in about 10 and about every

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Command Ring; Starboard]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a shiny yellow trash bin, a large stainless steel refrigerator, a
folding metal-framed chair, a stainless steel microwave oven, a stainless steel
kitchen table, a sleek stainless steel beverage machine with purple accents,

board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily says to Simon, "Yes Nissi is checking our position with respect to our
final destination in comms."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

everything in my ship around that time, 1 advantage of bringing it along after
all."

Or you can hand the key over early. They're cheap to make."
Akemi Bando presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

built-in phasers or something."

With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
Blake says to Zandria, "Save me."
Lily Kaise laughs.

glowing lenses slowly rise from Nissi Valdaire's face onto her forehead.

fractal patterns.

entirely sure how I'd describe it accept, uh. Purple."

Melinda Michaels grins.
Sakura Arakida asks in a Japanese accent, "Is it a stun cannon?"
Nissi Valdaire nods.
Sakura Arakida exclaims in a Japanese accent, "Nice!"
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I certainly don't want first-hand
knowledge."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh yeah why did I forget! I think it was
because I had Magellan doing his thing."

that way?"

decided to get mad and go home."
Morris Corlew nods.
Kim Saunders nods. "With which she did us all a favour."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She accused us of being traitors, me as
a murderer and then of course she fabricated other falsehoods and had this
horrible plan which had she carried it out, nne of us and our families back home
would be in existance."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "I still can't get it, plans to wipe
us all out and still gets her license back. What was her favourite motto? I can
think of it but that doesn't mean I will do it?"
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent, "She called you a murderer?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah she did."
Morris Corlew exclaims in an Old Earth accent, "Yikes!"

the side of the tank.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm probably the least violent person
you'll ever meet. I'd rather avoid someone then become physically involved."
Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "She was half a manipulator and half
seriously nuts. Some of it was her lying and some of it was her not actually
being sure what was true. I tried getting her to talk rationally and it honestly
creeped me out."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Oh for real!"
Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "How did she manage to get her
license back? Especially if she had some plan to...end everyone?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "That conversation I had with her about
the enemies of the AEU just got really weird by the time I had to sleep."
Lily says to Morris, "It was our Government who reinstated her. I have no words
to describe why."
A short eel-like creature with blue bioluminescence glides sinuously up against
the side of the tank.
Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "Forgive me, but...it doesn't sound
like it was...the smartest thing to do. Did they know everything?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep they did."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "She wasn't discriminating at all between
different pirate groups, to the point where it was kind of apparent she was
thinking of it as "The AEU and everyone else.""
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "No, nothing can possibly describe
what the AEU government was thinking when they reinstated her, the most
dangerous and crazy pilot we've had."

Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "So she's out there...somewhere?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I'm always reluctant to say someone's
the worst ever. There's loads of room for people to be terrible."
Lily says to Morris, "No she isn't a pilot anymore."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Who knows what civs do when a pilot
forcibly retires like that, for all we know she got herself locked up
somewhere."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And then they decided only
exceptional people can join the core now. Yeah, she sure was exceptional,
exceptionally insane or so."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well."
A short eel-like creature with blue bioluminescence glides sinuously up against
the side of the tank.

row."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Takana, Nils and Tatiana."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "The AEU's had civilian pilots since the
2260s right? That's basically three generations of pilots now."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But how do they decide who's
eceptional though."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Nissi
Valdaire's shoulder.
Lily says to Sakura, "Based upon their applicaiton I'm sure."
Sakura Arakida nods.
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Application and other qualifications."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Other qualifications besides their
applicaiton but they haven't disclosed anything to us nor when I was Voice of
the Corps did the Liaison mention anything."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Takana and Nils are no where near
the level of tatiana. And I think Nils used Takana for whatever she was
plotting."
A long eel-like creature with dim bioluminescence flicks its tail and darts
across the tank, its glow stuttering.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She did but Takana was just as evil."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Takana was out for Takana at whatever
cost."
Sakura Arakida nods.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Oh, did takana consider to launch a
beacon in mutuality space that could have made us all extinct?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She almost turned Pierre against me and
we had been friends for since I became a pilot."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "If that happened to me and a pirate
offered me help. Uh sorry but I'll destroy the ship before accepting help from
kelsey."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She was very very manipulative."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I don't consider that she was a
victim nor totally ignorant."
Sakura Arakida nods.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "No she wasn't not when she agreed to
hear them out in the first place."
Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "I would hear them out. Then go
straight to the Accord with all of it."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Lily Kaise nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I'd ask for an autograph, I think."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Might be neat for a scrap book."
Lily says to Nissi, "I so wanted the accord to do something."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

Sakura Arakida nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Akemi Bando presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.

the ship being in their docing bay and travel."

world.
Lily Kaise laughs.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
A long eel-like creature with dim bioluminescence swims around a small plastic
statue of Benjamin Masterson.
Sakura Arakida begins to whine and go through her long list of complaints about
the world.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway while I was Voice of the Corps
and when Tatiana was still active, the only confrontation I ever had with her
was when she attacked us. Otherwise, I did nothing to encourage her to leave the
Corps."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It wasn't my job."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I didn't cry though when the report
arrived in the office though."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I still wish you'd put censure of her up
for a vote or something, but it wasn't my place to do more than say "you totally
could do that.""
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I couldn't."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Sure you could. Censure just means you
as a group don't approve of something."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "You could of. Then sent it off to the
government."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It's as politically potent as a fart."
Morris Corlew chuckles at Akemi Bando. "Yeah, that'll show 'em."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well that was more during when Shule was
in the office though and we did vote on the validity of her report and the
majority discredited it."
Zandria Marschaund begins to whine and go through her long list of complaints
about the world.
Zandria Marschaund begins to whine and complain.  You are suddenly overcome by
the urge to hit her outside the head with a cardboard paper towel roll..
Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Would've been good. The AEU's
chronic problem is that when their pilots act up, everybody else sits back and
throws up their hands."
Sakura Arakida begins to whine and complain.  You are suddenly overcome by the
urge to hit her outside the head with a cardboard paper towel roll..
Zandria Marschaund laughs.
Sakura Arakida glances at Zandria Marschaund then immediately begins to whine,
listing all of her bad points. Someone seems to have had a rough day...
Zandria Marschaund glances at Sakura Arakida then immediately begins to whine,
listing all of her bad points. Someone seems to have had a rough day...
Zandria Marschaund exclaims in an Old Earth accent, "Oh jeez!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Otherwise -nissi no no we definitely did
not throw our hands up then and you know that."
Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Starting with Ather deciding to
dissolve all the AEU's alliances. Then there was the slaver thing."
Sakura Arakida winces.
Zandria says to Sakura, "Bad points, I don't remember any bad points. What a
Prozac moment."
A long eel-like creature with ultraviolet bioluminescence glides sinuously up
against the side of the tank.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Guess he wants the AEU to live up to
it's name being all isolated and the like."
Zandria Marschaund smirks.
Zandria Marschaund hugs Sakura Arakida.
Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "He started the trend."
Sakura says to Zandria, "Likewise."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Hmmm...too bad tht is."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "That is."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But he's only one person, and he's
not god. No offense."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well the Slaver thing was before my time
and I had very little in the files to go by to get the background except a
couple of letters but yeah had I been Voice of the Corps and we had that Slaver
thing, I'd have pushed our Corps into action as best I could."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I did actually try to talk to
tatiana and try to get her to tell the truth, and when I felt certain she was
not honest but she did not admit it, I wrote to shule, proposing he'd put up a
vote to have her removed from office as whip."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I'm telling Ather you said he's not god,
Sakura."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Nissi Valdaire's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Yeah exactly. It just takes
somebody standing up to him."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily says to Kim, "So did I and Shule has my letters."
Akemi Bando presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

Akemi Bando waves her fist menacingly.
Sakura says to Akemi, "Go on. I'm not afraid."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It never came to that vote though,
because tatiana didn't like us criticizing her so stepped down of her own free
will."
Akemi Bando flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A long eel-like creature with ultraviolet bioluminescence glides sinuously up
against the side of the tank.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked Buran-class rift galleon and
wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
Lily Kaise nods.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That is true."
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have no idea why Ather wants the
AEU to be so isolationist while he rarely does anything with us and spends all
his time with Cesar, keegan and them."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "That's called. Being a hypocrit."
Lily Kaise nods to Sakura Arakida.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The rest of us are not like that."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Maybe someone in the AEU should ask
him."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Or those of us who are currently active
pilots."
Sakura Arakida nods to Lily Kaise.
Sakura says to Lily, "I didn't mean to say you were I'm just saying he seems to
want it to be one way then does the other."
Lily Kaise nods to Sakura Arakida. "I understand what you meant."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Oh good."
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
Sakura Arakida cheers.
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Uh. Or not."
Zandria Marschaund thrusts both fists into the air and cheers.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Those of us who don't represent Ather
and his personal Clique want to work with others and be congenial."
Zandria Marschaund exclaims in an Old Earth accent, "Hell yeah!"
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "Nope it's not the beacon."
Kim Saunders nods. "Totally."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh that's the one I found."
Zandria says to Sakura, "Ah well. But I don't mind. We don't want to be
isolationist after all."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We're close."
Zandria Marschaund grins.
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I've never met Ather personally,
just a couple times on comms. But every AEU pilot I've met has been quite kind
and generous...as have most all pilots I've met."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's just slightly out of comms range."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "That's the one that's just barely out of
comms."
Lily Kaise nods.
Sakura Arakida nods.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Yeah. I remember I'd cruise over there
once in awhile just to check that no one stranded themselves."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Which means we're very close to home.
Or well sort of."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I used to maintain a beacon there but
it's not that convenient and there are better options."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Well that is nice."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It was active though and you could find
a lot of artifacts in quick order."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "I've got scads of upgrades to
put on my gem before I even think about artifacting anyway. Plus my nifty new
artie detector."
Lily Kaise grins.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But probably the same stuff you'd
find at 134 though."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well artifacting will provide you with
great income though."
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "Little note when you start
artifacting. Turn them in at the xeno station that's usually in belt of orion."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "And holy shit considering how
good my belt management station has been doing it's going to be super-dee-duper
awesome this time."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I'll be happy when I can go
artifacting. I've got to get my industry up though. Being out here for two weeks
has been great, but hasn't helped that, I'm sure."
Zandria says to Sakura, "Oh sure thing."
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "You'll get more credits than if
you were to turn them directly to the xeno center on old earth."
Lily Kaise nods to Morris Corlew.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "The orgs that contribute to the station
get money too."
Lily says to Morris, "You need to get your industry up so you can get your jet
and navaid."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "My 13 employees will be happy to get
paid."
Akemi Bando activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections
and recent ping returns.
Lily says to Morris, "Then after 300 Industry, you can bebin to turn in
artifacts."
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "Yes, absolutely."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "And there's that. So you'll be
helping out orgs by that too. Ok, I clearly can't talk straight right now so I'm
going to shut up."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "And I'll be so curious to see
how much exploration I will have when I get back. I'll have what I have now plus
that. If I work real hard I can get a rift drive too."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "I think I'll look into belt
management...then I can get the points up while getting them up doing other
things too."
Sakura says to Zandria, "We get back, go to the cartogrify branch and try to
submit findings for assisted planet finds. That's what I'll be doing."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Zandria says to Morris, "Thanks to Sakura, I got belt management up after I
stopped being a cadet."
Sakura Arakida grins at Zandria Marschaund.
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "And now it's doing swimmingly."
Sakura says to Zandria, "I didn't do anything just told you to set one up."
Lily says to Morris, "Belt management at your level will go very slowly. You
need to be more actively engaged in things like doing all of the missions from
SVP, salvaging especially and tesla."
Zandria says to Sakura, "Well it was advice, and I follow good advice, most of
the time."
Morris says to Zandria, "I hadn't considered it before. I've got a lot to do."
Lily says to Morris, "Later on, you can benefit from belt management moreso but
it costs a bit of credits to purchase the equipment needed there."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Nissi Valdaire's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Zandria says to Morris, "Oh yeah, but tesla like a crazy first so you can but
all the parts."
Morris Corlew nods. "I didn't know about missions at SVP other than bringing in
RATS cores until recently."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "And I wonder how all my felo
are..."
Lily says to Morris, "Well do all you can because later you will max out on
points qualificaitons for SVP and you won't be able to."
galnce
I don't understand that.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "And when, uh kim, or akemi, not sure
who's sending off the pictures gets them sent off, it'll take maybe a day before
we all get paid for stuff."

Lily Kaise nods.

Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "That's okay but we'll get
enough from the finds right now to do some positive damage."

Zandria Marschaund cackles!

Lily Kaise grins at Zandria Marschaund.

Sakura says to Morris, "I like mine too."

Sakura says to Lily, "Same here. I'm not even at 300 gcp yet."

You say, "It's mine too."
Akemi Bando presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Akemi Bando presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Eaos is a glass cannon, hits hard,
but. Doesn't have much in the way of support."
Akemi Bando presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 025."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "That'll work."
Sakura Arakida cheers.
Morris Corlew cheers.
Kim Saunders exclaims in a New Bristol accent, "Ooh, there!"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Still can't see the Bubble for some
reason, but hey, 025 is fine."
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

Akemi Bando is in the photo. She is sitting on a dark yellow leather captain's
chair with Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo and Sassie the sleeping
large fuchsia felo on it.
She appears to be at Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room.
She appears to be 32 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has pale skin. Her body is petite with bony hips and thin calves. She has thin
shoulders and small breasts. Her face is oval and girlish, with a straight nose
and sharp chin. Her lips are pouty and reddish pink and occasionally part to
reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are dark
brown and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is jet black and in a
bun. She has neatly trimmed light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing an indigo synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed
on the collar, a black utility belt, and a pair of soft black boots. She is also
wearing a keychain adorned with a tag-shaped amulet covered in tyrian purple
fabric brocaded with a floral pattern, a smooth black velvet handbag, a black
wrist-mounted chronometer, a personal filing computer, a metallic gray touch
einrophone in a dark gray leather phone holster, and an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and
both hands are left uncovered.
Sassie the sleeping large fuchsia felo
It appears to be at a dark yellow leather captain's chair with Xavier the
sleeping big silver soldier felo and Sassie the sleeping large fuchsia felo on
it.
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in average-length, striped
fuchsia fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth.
The felo's average-length, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick,
hooked white claws visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear
green eyes with horizontal pupils. It is wearing a sparkling ruby collar. It
also has a pair of dark pink satin tail ribbons tied in bows. It appears to be
sleeping.

almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in average-length, striped
fuchsia fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth.
The felo's average-length, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick,
hooked white claws visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear
green eyes with horizontal pupils. It is wearing a sparkling ruby collar. It
also has a pair of dark pink satin tail ribbons tied in bows. It appears to be
sleeping.

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Recently, you applied to the Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special
Licenses seeking permission to purchase and operate an AW-2 AEU Flare-class
Twin-Assault Vessel. Your application was analyzed by our finest psychologists,
and we also reviewed all records of your service as a pilot.
Unfortunately, at the conclusion of this process, we reached the decision that
we could not accept your application at this time.
You are welcome to re-apply at the beginning of the next six week civilian
liaison term. If you choose to do so, we will take your new application
responses into account along with any new additions to your pilot record that
have occurred in the intervening time.
Until then, please accept our condolences and find enclosed one coupon for a
free small Rickety Rick's Spacey Cheesey Fries.
Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

My dearest,
I miss you so much. I only woke up long enough to explain to you that I have had
a very busy past few days keeping me away from my piloting duties. I am hoping
that life outside of piloting clears up for me really soon, like in the next day
or so. I miss you and I keep dreaming about you. I hope you have not forgotten
me yet. I promise that I will be back very soon and resume my goal of catching
up to you. I expect my schedule to open up in another day or less. Just always
remember I love you, I will always love you, and I will always want and need
you.
Love forever,

Starseekers expedition Information
 
Hello,
I write this letter to you to confirm that you are on the crew list of the
expedition I am organizing. this letter also contains some information about the
trip.
 
- we wil be traveling aboard Akemi's science vessel, which she kindly has made
available for this occasion. akemi will hand out keys just before departure. we
will bring a few other ships along, keys for these will be handed out if and as
needed.
- We will start gathering for departure on the first of June at 23:00 GST. we
wil meet on Old Earth in the coffee shop. this coffee shop is located in the
spaceport, between the landing pad and the south point exit. We are aiming for a
departure time of 23:59 GST.
- You should be prepared for a trip that will take roughly 2 weeks. Melinda has
made various food and drink dispensers available, but it might be nice if you
brought a small amount of food for greater variety.
- to keep it fair for everyone, and to make sure we can bring a full crew,
everyone is allowed to bring only 1 pet felo. If you choose to bring one, you
are also required to bring a felo spacesuit for it.
- we will have a few crew members who have never been on an expedition like
this. If you do not have any rift drive repair tools yet, do not worry. akemi
has spare tools available and we will still have time to craft more of such
tools.
- As of the time of this writing, the crew for this expedition is as follows:
Akemi, anfisa, Melinda, Lillian, shule, Lily, Nissi, Liam, Michael, Blake,
simon, Nathaniel, Morris, Sakura, Zandria and myself. 
 
should you have any questions that I have not answered in this letter, feel free
to contact me and ask. also if you are not sure you are still awake during the
gathering and departure time, talk to me or Akemi and we will make arrangements
with you.
I am sure we are all looking forward to a fun expedition, and see you tomorrow!
take care,
Kim (Starseekers founder)

I needed would be a piece. Many, many thanks!"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Even a RATS miner would be a debris
chunk? Could it be in an adjascent sector?"

navigate through sectors in the direction given. In your case, go down from
D-04."

you would go."

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a small seashell pink
trash can, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and a glass-covered
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy sapphire blue
ceramic felo chow bowl, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

This is an orbital marketplace, connected to others like it through a series of

allowed to operate on planets or large space stations. A computer interface
provides access to buying and selling on the marketplace, and a large chute
underneath it allows items to emerge as they are delivered via wormhole.

[Starseekers] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I do, before I vote."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Think you'd need a medium
active to reach back to Orion if you weren't using a passive. Want to say they
got 20 lightyears of range."
tra org As well as with Michael.
[Starseekers] Shule Elemmire transmits, "As well as with Michael."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Correct."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Makes sense."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Those minimals have like 3
lightyears or so. Perfect for return beacons at Battle of Mir or Drift Funnel or
something, not as useful for the Bubble."
'Heh, I'm probably going to be the stick in the mud when it comes to new member
applications for the org.
You say, "Heh, I'm probably going to be the stick in the mud when it comes to

artifacting anyways though."

powered stations in belt of orion."
'I want to talk to all applicants before I vote. I'm not just going to throw

Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "So who all has applied?"
'Michael and Simon.
You say, "Michael and Simon."
Lily Kaise nods.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "You don't lose all that much
time in travel when a high powered accelerator is involved."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "True."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "So who joined?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have not investigated this
myself, but the people who have say that this makes the stations cheaper with
still a reasonable life span."
'Got the impression Michael was ingorming me.
You say, "Got the impression Michael was ingorming me."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Indeed."
'er, ignoring.
You say, "Er, ignoring."
Lily Kaise nods.
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Don't you all also combine the
accelerator into one station for 465 and bubble?"
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Ahh, well, I'm not too unhappy
for my first time putting up a rift station."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Splitting the passive beacon
alone on its own large precharged lets it stay up for over a month too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well he does have a bit of a chippy
attitude. He can be pretty nice but he is different."
nod
You nod.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "The accelerator station at
Orion has two accelerators and an inserter. One points at 465, the other at the
Bubble."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Thought so."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Fortunately only one needs to
be the high powered. You can use a low end for the other directions."

You say to Lily, "Well, we weren't really established yet and didn't have much

[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Not too shabby for your first
time then Johann."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Have you tried calling for Michael?"
tra org Not yet. I will in a bit
[Starseekers] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not yet. I will in a bit."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Got it pointed in the right
direction, that's the biggest part."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro chuckles.
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Filling up this transport
with shipwreck pieces is going to take a while. But I'm getting rid of control
boards, sensor comps and twisted hunks of steel. Though the points will be nice
when this is over."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It's a real puzzle, these
inserter accelerator things. I have a sheet of paper in my portfolio detailing a
3 way accelerator hub, should we ever need such a construct again. Because, I
could not remember how to for the life of me."

You hug Lily Kaise.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh wow, you will be salvaging
for hours sakura."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "I still have the letter that
Mel gave me like a year ago for that one Kim."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Should posterize it or
something."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro chortles.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm just kidding you. I wouldn't join an
org simply for what they have to offer. There is more that I have something to
offer them. I paid my dues to Starseekers in points and credits and tried to
help them along. So it all depends upon the organization, it's membership and a
lot of aspects for me to consider them. You'd be surprised to know too, that I'd
have considered a smaller organization."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Akemi helped us a lot back then
with figuring this out."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Reminds me, need to jot down
the heading for 134."

You grin at Lily Kaise.
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I've never been there."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Fine place."
[Notification from Starseekers] Kim Saunders has revoked Angel Martin's founder
status.
[Notification from Starseekers] Angel Martin is no longer the acting founder.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Shipwrecks are great for
getting lots of pieces for salvage, so more points."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Plus a good amount of local
artifacts."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "What's the grade on the
salvage?"
'It was pretty cool though. We all worked to gether a lot. I wish Starseekers
was more like it.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "20 to 30."
You say, "It was pretty cool though. We all worked to gether a lot. I wish
Starseekers was more like it."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Not like you're gonna be making
huge bank on salvaging anyways."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "True, but it does help."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "More for salvage ops than
anything."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I do like those."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "We've got a grade 50 oort we
use for that out near Campeche, should the desire to run ops pops up again."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But yes I wouldn't join an org as small
as starseekers unless I was offered a trustee position. Kim has not mentioned
that in an offer so it's a no go. Cats is a more established and larger
organization so being a member would be ok for me as they wouldn't need to
depend on me since they have a better balance of strong pilots. Invaders would
be the same for me and I wouldn't need to be a trustee there because even though
Invaders is small owadays, they h would offer more of what i'd prefer. So since
neither org is going to bid for me, unless I form my own org which I likely
won't do unless I ever get a cruiser and need t place to put it, I'll remain
solo."
'But I did something that Kim has yet to do and I don't know how much of a
difference it made, but I specifically put people in charge of certa
responsibilities.
You say, "But I did something that Kim has yet to do and I don't know how much

[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "If anyone wants to write it
down, heading to 134 is 157.5, 7."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Grade 50 is a bit rare there,
unfortunately, but it's still a nice cloud."

right?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Correct."
'I think I just surpassed her before we left.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I don't think so, it's one of
those shipwreck places."
You say, "I think I just surpassed her before we left."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I use a large pre-charged for
the accelerator out there usually, since that'll power an inserter/accelerator
for about 16 days."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Do we want to separate out the
beacons on their own stations? Was thinking I could take that on for our spots."
'But the last time we were on a nest together, she had me lead.
You say, "But the last time we were on a nest together, she had me lead."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Our points will take a plunge but we can
earn those back as long as we have members who are willing to put time and
effort into the org."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She's also been a pilot longer than you
and I doubt she knows half as much as you do."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Save Seekers some megacredits
on large precharged batteries too, I can front the cash for that myself."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Heh she tried to talk me into using
shainguns on a rental for bari one time for cleansing and I just refusted to
participate."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Refused."
'heh, why?
You ask, "Heh, why?"
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Why did I refuse?"
'She likes chainguns though.
You say, "She likes chainguns though."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Isn't it obvious?"
'No, I'm wondering why she wanted to use chainguns on bari.
You say, "No, I'm wondering why she wanted to use chainguns on bari."
Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She said they would be more effective."
'Horse feathers!
You exclaim, "Horse feathers!"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You are welcome to use our
batteries, Cesar. It's what they are there for and members of our org can also
see how long stations are still up for that way."
Lily Kaise chuckles.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Just be more of them used if we
split the beacons out."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Then she got on me for refusing to
participate I just didn't respond."

You say, "Chains don't interrupt nearly as much as lasers do, take ammunition,
and do about as much damage as lasers do on a rental... so..."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The nice thing about the beacons
being split out is that if they're all that's on a large pre-charged it'll last
over a month."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Speaking of wild akemi's."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Assuming it's a passive beacon
at least."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Aye."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Could really go hard and put
them on those slow burner fusion reactors."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro chuckles.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well also consider they are different in
terms of how their impact is on bari is versus metalic targets. Same for
gravitics or projectiles."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
'That was going to be my next point.
You say, "That was going to be my next point."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "An extra 200 million for an
extra two weeks isn't that great a deal."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uhm, not sure what the
difference is in how long they last. The price difference between large
precharged batteries and those things is substantial though."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Depends how much you value your
time!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If I had to choose a weapon besides
plasma or nanites, I'd choose lasers for bari."
'Me too. Any day.
You say, "Me too. Any day."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "Come on rift speed, go
faster."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The salvage station itself falls
in multiples of 12 days, so they about synch up on a one to three cycle."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah, it should slow down,
just for you."
Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Although I know we've been
thinking of experimenting with a blast chamber again out there."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Aisling alone could keep that
thing going when she gets on her salvaging kicks."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not many are going to give up their
debris that they can earn points and credits for to fuel a lousy blast furnace."
Lily Kaise laughs.

[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I will give you a chance to vote on
those 2 actions then before I put my vote in."
tra org Ok, sounds good. As soon as I talk to both of them, I'll vote.
[Starseekers] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, sounds good. As soon as I talk to

[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ok."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "If I voted, that sort of would make your

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Haha."
Cesar Ysidro presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a RATS
Nanite Integrator from storage and sets it in front of him.
An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the

The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering
position near the space station's docking bay.
You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.
launch
You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)

Wait 13 seconds.
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You can go north.
A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a
burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.

Sakura Arakida
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. She has
narrow shoulders and somewhat small breasts. Her face is heart-shaped and
girlish, with a delicate nose and sharp chin. Her lips are lovely and rosebud
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
expressive eyebrows, her eyes are pale blue and round. Her shoulder-length, wavy
hair is blue-black with midnight blue highlights and evenly cut in the back but
layered in the front to softly frame her face. She has oval rosy fingernails.
A star-shaped blood jasper stud pierces her right earlobe and a star-shaped
blood jasper stud pierces her left earlobe.
 She is wearing a black leather jacket decorated with jeweled lavender swirls, a
very tight lavender tank top with 'BEE STINGS' printed in silver across the
chest, a pair of skinny black jeans with amethyst and azure blue jeweled
starbursts on the front pockets, and a pair of shiny black kinky boots with
stiletto heels. She is also wearing a dark metallic pink touch einrophone in a
dark gray leather phone holster, a shimmering pink and gold cherry blossom
keychain, a compact metallic saffron camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on
the front with a glittery cobalt blue camera strap, a rose pink silk backpack
embroidered with gold cherry blossoms, a fine gold link necklace with a glowing
red crystal star pendant, and a long red leather whip. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a tall glass of peach tea in her right hand.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Bari Smasher!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "Bari Smasher!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the

 She is wearing a short-sleeved white cotton top trimmed with tiny embroidered
flowers, a pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of strappy white leather
sandals. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a clear camera with a saucy strap, and a sturdy navy blue canvas AEU
backpack. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both

[Starship "Bari Smasher!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, Here are some personell reports and
the state of the core for you. I appologize in the delay for getting these to
you. In the past few weeks, the following pilots have retired: John Houbersmith,
Farn Julius, Micaelius Ik and Carter Maclaine. Then here is the state of the
core report for June 10th 2316. At this time, the AEU had completed 21 out of 76
decoy beacon drops (27.63%), was responsible for 1 out of 8 destroyed RATS nests
(12.50%), and was responsible for 0 out of a total of 1 salvage ops (0%). that
concludes the information from the reports on my desk. I would like to report
that the expedition I lead found a total of 6 planets, and we took 16 space
imaging photographs, one of a pulsar. It's not a huge accomplishment, but a nice
start of getting us back into exploration. Have a nice day, and fly safe! [12:41

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless coral pink cotton top with a three-button front and
a v-neck, a pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue
and coral pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, and a pair of
leather thong sandals with a white flowered print. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a clear camera with a

Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings AEU, There has been an
abundance of bari pods as of late. Lily and I took down six yesterday and one
more today. Plus, others took down a couple yesterday as well. Some sectors had
two bari pods in them, something I'd never seen before. Anyways, keep an eye out
for them and please announce it over the Tactical channel. Also, keep an eye out
for bari spreaders as well and announce them over tactical. Take care and fly
safe. [16:25 15 June 2316 GST]
