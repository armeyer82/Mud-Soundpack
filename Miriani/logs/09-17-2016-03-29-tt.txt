Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, an insulated green
cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, a clear plastic food storage container,
Jewel the large violet glowing felo, and Sassie the large fuchsia felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "RockIt!, you have clearance to launch.
Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant
430" has jumped into the sector.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered
Merchant 430! Welcome to home space!"
Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial
Gate station is now largely irrelevant, but still stands guard here as a sort of
watchtower.
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant
043" has jumped into the sector.
The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar
possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life,
with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.

Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for landing clearance.

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anybody know if there's any harm to
going ahead and roping a roid you just supported about? Or should I leave it in
the sector and go elsewhere?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "If something is broken it is usually
better to leave it alone so it can be examined and whatever went wrong with it
can be determined."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Hard to say. If there was a traceback,
it could be an issue."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. Well, I already pulled in at least
two that might be broken, and I know someone else supported about the same issue
several days ago...so I'll leave it be."
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "If the roid's stuck in a place where it
shouldn't be, then best to leave it alone."

basicly cheating by getting them from there each time. They don't disappear."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I already supported it, and had hauled

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
JJI[jRMg~K0],ahZ#y+)0C<FsV}ne#eQ=y?(KP*:
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hey
pilots, don't forget to feed the furnace from time to time. Also, if you are
traveling via the accelerators, don't forget to have some EAOS credits on hand.
Last but not least, stay safe out there!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
[Notification from Starseekers] The organization has received 1,556,084.91 EAOS
credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in
The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Beta 287. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ugh."

Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
