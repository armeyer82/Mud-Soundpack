Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl, Mekensie the humanoid
service robot, and a big red felo here.
You can go south and out.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.
The following is a listing of current and former (player character) pilots

to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The
nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that
one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the

cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able
to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The
nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that
one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the

walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news

Tamra Swenson
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has freckled skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with attractively
curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has angular shoulders and slightly
smaller than average breasts. Her face is heart-shaped, lightly-freckled, and
subtly asymmetrical, with a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly
upturned and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath
a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-grey and narrow. Her shoulder-length
, wavy hair is coppery red and swept back from her face into a mass of tousled
curls. She has long clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a strapless fern green gown with a sequined bodice and a skirt
of flowing layers of filmy chiffon sparkling with tiny sequins, a tasteful
silver watch with diamond accents, and a pair of classic fern green silk pumps.
She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed
aggregator, a second-hand metachannel FTL communicator, a delicate silver
necklace with an opalescent moonstone pendant, a delicate silver bracelet with
tiny crescent moon charms, a silver ring set with a polished opalescent
moonstone, a sparkly silver purse shaped like a crescent moon, a flight control
scanner, a temporary space station reference device, and a tyrian purple swivel
einrophone in a golden brown reinforced plastic phone holster. Her head, face,
both eyes, neck, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, left
wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "The Wolves Have Claws"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass

on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,

[Starship "Unicorn"; Control Room]
This control room would look less out of place as an old atmospheric fighter
cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able
to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The
nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that
one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the
pilot's controls. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

Star Conquest Help: Glyphmakers Graves
--
Category: Activities
--
The Glyphmakers' Graves are the remnants of an alien civilization found in a
particular region of deep space. As far as anyone can tell, they mostly left
behind thousands of small outpost stations of an unknown purpose. Their written
language appears to be primarily based on shape and color, hence the name
Glyphmakers.
While their stations have valuable materials and technology that can be
salvaged, they are also still protected by robotic defenses, and Accord
guidelines recommend that each station be boarded by a pair of battlesuit-equipp
ed explorers. The Gemini Assault Class scout is perfectly suited to this mission
profile.
The Glyphmakers were particularly skilled at circuit miniaturization, a
technology that humankind has been slow to develop. Construction guidelines
found at their stations use the universal language of simple mechanical
engineering, and are relatively easily interpreted by any technologically-inclin
ed human in order to adapt Glyphmaker salvage into new useful applications. In
other words, Glyphmaker stations contain blueprints and insights for new items
and the materials with which to build them.
Theme note: Items made with Glyphmaker blueprints should not be thought of as
strictly alien technology -- rather, you are reinterpreting their instructive
documents for your own purposes. For example, Glyphmakers did not develop
service robots that look human and speak a human language, but materials they
left behind will help you to build these yourself. Similarly, Glyphmakers may or
may not have had rift drive technology, but alien guidelines and devices for
manipulating electromagnetic fields will help you develop rift sail extenders.
A rift drive is required to reach the Glyphmakers' Graves, meaning that
exploring their stations is decidedly NOT an activity for newer characters. You
will be served best by waiting until you qualify for a rift drive yourself, at
300 exploration points or 3000 industry points, before you begin exploring these
stations.
The location of the Glyphmakers' Graves is not a secret, but the information is
beyond the scope of this help file. Please discover it by interacting with other
characters. Since the activity requires a partner, someone will likely be quite
eager to teach you how it is done!

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[PA] Lily Kaise: "I should have grouped everyone first."
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
3)SU'pjy0jLMdvUFmNymueG24,KkM02MPG7#i;?P
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights

[Starship "test"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space. This is a crude virtual representation. An
END command constantly floats in the corner of your vision.

Guindalen Jones
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with slightly curved hips
and pleasantly curved calves. She has broad shoulders and somewhat large
breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and unblemished, with a delicate
nose and round chin. Her lips are soft and pinkish red and occasionally part to
reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and round. Her mid-back length, soft with a slight wave hair is light
auburn and drawn back in pigtails. She has neatly trimmed pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a brown leather bomber jacket, a simple short-sleeved buttercup
yellow silk dress, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a
keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a small cloth
sack, a yellow canvas backpack, and a metachannel FTL communicator. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and
both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay

Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth.
Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her
close-cropped, bristly hair is glossy obsidian and shaven down to stubble except
for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has
several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown
leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin
charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces
her right upper ear, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick
gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
 She is wearing a heavy wraparound neck chain, a faded black leather jacket
trimmed with steel studs, a faded black silk short sleeve shoulderless top, a
black leather spiderweb belt with a silver spider buckle, a pair of tight black
jeans, and a pair of stompy black leather cross-strapped boots. She is also
wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic
glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm
resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted
chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of
small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately
carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning
bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named
Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Worker Ant", the one-person cargo
hauler "Fire Comet", the two-person Accord gemini "Driftwood", and the

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, and Vartija the arachnoid security robot
here.

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking
bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very
well built and maintained station.
The one-person cargo hauler "Dreamstar", the one-person fighter "Dragonfly", the
scout "White Eagle", and the vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" are landed
