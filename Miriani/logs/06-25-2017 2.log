00:33:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

00:33:52 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go south and out.

00:33:54 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

00:33:54 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:33:55 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:50:42 The computer finishes deleting the partial data from its optical spectography program.

02:51:09 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

02:51:13 Lily Kaise says, "So guess we may not be able to complete that one."

02:51:15 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:51:40 You say, "Too bad."

02:51:51 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I also can't specify an argument such as which remaining analysis is to be done."

03:13:45 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

03:13:46 You remove a gold spacesuit helmet from your head.

03:13:47 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

03:13:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:13:48 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

03:13:52 I don't understand that.

03:13:52 Try this instead:  put plat ein xeno in

03:13:56 You put a metallic hull plate of an unfamiliar design into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

03:13:59 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:15:55 The ship's current engine speed is 26087 km/s.

03:15:56 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 7.8 seconds.

03:15:58 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:18:22 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

03:18:25 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:18:26 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Artifact (nearest).

03:18:28 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:18:41 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:18:46 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:18:48 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:18:51 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:18:54 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:19:05 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to yellow.

03:19:11 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to red.

03:19:14 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:19:31 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the tritium."

03:20:04 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:20:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

03:20:10 A small light on the airlock door turns from red to yellow.

03:20:15 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to green.

03:20:19 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:20:23 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

03:20:26 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:20:29 Lily Kaise removes a plain white spacesuit helmet from her head.

03:20:34 Lily Kaise puts a sphere of cohesive slow-flowing liquid into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

03:20:41 [MTTS] usfolks: Wait, a roid hauler did a beacon? While I know it's armed well enough, somehow I find that comical.

03:20:58 [MTTS] atherj: Any ship is technically capable of launching a decoy beacon. Keep it IC!

03:21:09 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

03:21:34 Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

03:22:05 [MTTS] usfolks: No way to make that IC. It was mentioned on here!

03:22:19 [MTTS] atherj: Oh, it was? Weirdnesses.

03:22:26 [MTTS] usfolks: Yes, by Squid.

03:22:49 [MTTS] atherj: Heck, technically a void piercer is even capable of launching a decoy beacon. Whether or not it would finish it though...well.

03:23:15 [MTTS] usfolks: Heh. That's even more comical.

03:23:39 [MTTS] Ulias: Use salvage grapples.

03:23:46 [MTTS] atherj: A lot of the asteroid haulers are actually fairly well armed. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for them to do decoy beacon drops.

03:23:58 [MTTS] usfolks: Yes, I actually said that.

03:24:23 [MTTS] atherj: Actually I knew of a few people who have done that before. I think I even did it once.

03:24:34 [MTTS] atherj: Nothing really funny about it, just doable!

03:24:57 [MTTS] usfolks: I know they can. It's just humorous to me. Like salvaging in a gunship (and not during combat).

03:25:04 [MTTS] moose: Whatever works, really.

03:25:14 [MTTS] atherj: Pretty much, Moose!

03:25:24 [MTTS] Ulias: If they were hauling a roid, would it become a mobile weapons boulder?

03:27:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:27:12 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:29:09 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:29:17 [Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "B-60 clear."

03:29:28 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What happened?"

03:29:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They seem like they're getting a bit heated from time to time, but that's ok. The good thing is that folks are having a conversation."

03:29:33 [Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Missions."

03:29:40 [Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "But we got jumped by pirates first."

03:29:41 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Darnit. Ok."

03:29:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:29:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I gave up Eli it's rather fruitless. We're already on a rather sordid decline."

03:30:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's exactly the time to not give up. In fact, it's kind of hte opposite."

03:31:14 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:31:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:31:24 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go enter into the ship.

03:31:28 You place a gold spacesuit helmet atop your head.

03:31:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I couldn't obviously vote for the Green Party which was rather disappointing. Best seemed promising but he's proving to be quite the Separatist and I personaly abhor privitazaiton which is about as bad as it gets so we really had very poor candidates to begin with."

03:31:38 You are already wearing a gold spacesuit helmet.

03:31:39 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

03:31:41 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

03:31:44 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

03:31:48 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

03:31:50 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

03:31:58 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

03:31:58 [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:31:59 [Outside William Dove]

03:31:59 You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to William Dove.

You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

03:32:55 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

03:32:57 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

03:32:59 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

03:33:06 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

03:33:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:33:07 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

03:33:09 You remove a gold spacesuit helmet from your head.

03:33:12 You put an organic-looking piece of material not unlike wood which is in fact artificial into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

03:33:18 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:33:22 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:33:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

03:33:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, the elction is over. It's no longer about that. And I can understand some of the standpoints even if I don't agree with them. But the formation of the so-called Ministry of Facts should be a big wake-up call."

03:33:33 The ship's current engine speed is 26087 km/s.
At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 6.0 seconds.

03:33:35 The ship's current engine speed is 26087 km/s.

03:35:00 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

03:35:06 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:35:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Artifact (nearest).

03:35:07 The starship is already moving.

03:35:08 The starship is already moving.

03:35:10 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:35:13 You say to Lily, "Go for it."

03:35:36 Lily Kaise nods and nods and nods.

03:35:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We pilots are used to not getting all the information. We all signed up for it when we signed our contracts. But the regular citizens signed no such contracts, and yet they're about to start only getting the scraps that the adminstration wants them to have."

03:35:41 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:36:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eli I can tell you this. The administration puts out some extreme vetting when new pilots sign up. They want loyalists to Best."

03:37:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:37:41 The ship is not moving.

03:37:42 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:37:54 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to yellow.

03:37:59 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to red.

03:38:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fast forward a few years and Best might as well be Nina thomas and the AEU the new Fringe."

03:38:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:38:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

03:38:49 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Yeah, it could be a similar analagie but she is a different type of human."

03:38:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah, it could be a similar analagie but she is a different type of human."

03:39:08 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Analagy that is."

03:39:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Analagy that is."

03:39:09 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

03:39:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I take that back. As far as I know Nina Thomas has never tried to put restrictions on science."

03:39:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

03:39:59 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Yes which is why I couldn't draw similarities."

03:39:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes which is why I couldn't draw similarities."

03:40:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I could certainly be wrong about that though."

03:40:48 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "She seems to be primarily focused upon military pursuits."

03:40:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "She seems to be primarily focused upon military pursuits."

03:40:54 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:41:01 A small light on the airlock door turns from red to yellow.

03:41:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So is Best."

03:41:06 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to green.

03:41:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "But that fits, the Fringe is a military dictatorship from the best that I understand."

03:41:52 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Yes but his constraints upon scientific and exploration efforts are quite different."

03:41:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes but his constraints upon scientific and exploration efforts are quite different."

03:41:58 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:41:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The AEU is a parlimentary democracy at best."

03:42:05 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

03:42:10 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:42:13 Lily Kaise removes a plain white spacesuit helmet from her head.

03:42:16 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:42:18 Lily Kaise puts an oddly-designed wormhole drive construct into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

03:42:19 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:42:25 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:42:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The stance on exploration is to military funding. Which, an increase in military funding isn't really a bad thing in itself."

03:43:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met all our goals! Let's keep up the good work!"

03:43:27 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:43:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well Our Navy is already the finest hands down. I don't think you would despute that except that they should be given Flares."

03:43:56 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Could you be quiet, we are having a serious conversation on channel one."

03:44:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But combined with restricting information like that.. I'm just saying that if we're not careful, we'll end up a military dictatorship as well."

03:44:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you don't want to hear the pilot liaison who is just doing his job and announcing goal status, then tune out of channel 10."

03:44:29 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:44:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I totally agree."

03:46:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will say this and take heat for it I bet. We are in this situlation because those who were pilots before Best took office found that inaction was the best policy. That isolationism was the best policy and you see how that worked out."

03:48:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We obviously can not run things ourselves and by ourselves or we would not be in the state that we are currently in."

03:49:17 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:49:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Unfortunately, I don't see that we will be able to effect much influence. We have managed to survive extinction so in consideration of this, I just don't think we'll be heard. Also Vernos, Privatization wouldn't have worked any better. Privitazation generally means poor execution and eventual ruin especially upon the type of functions we perform. Privatazation may work for some aspects but not for a pilot corps which should be there for our Government and Privatization would not have afforded this."

03:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't necessarily agree with that, but then I was flying in a time before all this other bad stuff started happening."

03:50:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:50:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Privitazation generally goes to the lowest bidder and it is a generally not managed well."

03:50:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "When we were running it, and seemingly doing fine, unless my memory is just shot."

03:50:45 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:50:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Care to chime in on that particular aspect Ather? Did the Pilot CORPS ever run itself just fine?"

03:51:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What I am saying is I do not agree with the policy that we can do things ourselves and back before we dug the grave we are in. We should have been working with the other governments instead of backing out of alliances."

03:51:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I misunderstood you Vernos. That was my fault."

03:51:52 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:51:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I am convinced that the more conservative candidate had the same idea in mind as the Green Party candidate and that is to eliminate the Pilot Corps via low-performing management."

03:52:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I agree, working with the other alliances is the only reason we're all still alive."

03:52:32 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:52:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep true and we should strive to continue to do so."

03:52:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Now that we are in our grave no one wants to form an alliance to help us out of it or at least so it would seem."

03:53:20 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:53:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Of course not. Why would they want to as we were once a huge competitor."

03:53:57 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:53:59 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:53:59 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go enter into the ship.

03:54:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "They would rather keep us in an inferior position. However, all we can and should do is strive to prove ourselves different."

03:54:14 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

03:54:15 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

03:54:29 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

03:54:29 [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:54:31 [Outside William Dove]

03:54:31 You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to William Dove.
You are weightless here.
You carefully open the hatch and float outside.

03:54:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Honestly, when we broke off full alliance relations, we were doing more than fine for a while. The only issues occurred when the older pilots like Kaito went away, and pilots like me had less and less time to do things and to deticate ourselves to certain matters. Then you went away too Eli, and the newer pilots all didn't really want to do much. When it came to exploration, a lot of them said they would lead expeditions, and only one really led one, and he left not too long ago too. After that, other things started to decline. Pilots ran fewer beacon drops, fewer ground activities etc and that was around the time that the decline started. However, it definitely didn't start when alliance relations were lowered to levels of non-aggression pacts. Heck, Kaito and I, regardless of the lack of full alliance relations still practically helped lead the defense of most sectors for the longest times. I'm just letting people presume because it's kind of amusing to watch people who have only been pilots for meer months interject their ever so informed opinions."

03:54:35 You glance at the display screen of a spacesuit navaid and see...

03:55:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I hear you Ather but we need to pick up and go forward as best we can."

03:55:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ugh and not the name obviously."

03:55:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well and for the record, I don't even really mean full alliances. I just mean working with at all. It feels more and more like we're on a path of not working with them at all, or being ordered to or something."

03:55:52 [Deep Space]

03:55:52 You see a metallic hull plate of an unfamiliar design here.

03:56:19 Wait 2 seconds.

03:56:20 Wait 1 seconds.

03:56:21 Wait 1 seconds.

03:56:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:56:22 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

03:56:26 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

03:56:27 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

03:56:28 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

03:56:30 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

03:56:35 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

03:56:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

03:56:42  You are wearing a gold spacesuit helmet, a black spacesuit top with a red star on the right shoulder, a pair of black spacesuit gloves with a gold stripe around each cuff, a black spacesuit bottom with a red stripe down the outside of each leg, and a pair of black spacesuit boots with a gold stripe down each side. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of white cotton briefs, and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.

03:56:42 You are carrying a metallic hull plate of an unfamiliar design in your right hand.

03:56:49 You put a metallic hull plate of an unfamiliar design into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

03:56:53 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:56:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, we still work with other alliances. Don't most of us do beacon drops, go on exploration trips etc with members of other alliances? Don't we help defend their sectors in times of invasion, and vice versa?"

03:57:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Absolutely, we do for the moment."

03:57:38 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Shule Elemmire say, "Yeah, the last time I went to defend League space. They jumped down my back, not the other way around."

03:57:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, the last time I went to defend League space. They jumped down my back, not the other way around."

03:57:46 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:57:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep we do and I want it to continue that way but there are advantages at least with upholding our NAP at least where applicable?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I can tell you that after a conversation I had last night of a hypothethical nature. The League would not work with us if their government told them not to."

03:57:47 You remove a gold spacesuit helmet from your head.

03:58:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:58:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Vernoz that is not new news."

03:58:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They don't have much choice Vernos."

03:58:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not the fault of the older pilots who went away. Eventually, pilot life becomes too much for lots of people, and they might need to take breaks. However, those who were around were supposed to pick up the slack when some of the older pilots had lesser and lesser time to deticate to the work. That they didn't, and didn't inspire the pilots who came later, is their fault, and most of those pilots who were around at that time are not even around anymore either."

03:58:33 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:58:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "They state that but that would be in violation of the existing NAP."

03:58:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not to mention that their government owns all of their starships, just they like they own all of ours."

03:59:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lily I doubt if the government told them not to help that an NAP as you put it would exist."

03:59:29 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:59:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Um."

03:59:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If their government tells them to break the NAP, then they break the NAP. That's just how it will go. They don't have a choice, because as Eli said, the government owns a vast majority of their assets anyway."

03:59:45 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:59:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Vernos you listen to their rhetoric far too much."

04:00:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And you tune out a real possibilty so that you do not have to deal with it."

04:00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That kinda stuff is exactly why I think we need to make sure our voices are heard. If the current adminstration decides something like that for us, we don't have much choice."

04:00:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I. Agree with eli."

04:01:04 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:01:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Not really but I think for myself and not what others want me to think."

04:01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eli and Ather are correct and trust me, the talk is there of not helping the AEU if they break from the Accord already."

04:01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, that just goes back to the meeting that Kim wants to have. Perhaps as a part of that meeting, we can issue a joint statement from the AEU pilot corps, to the AEU government, requesting that we maintain ties with the other alliances, continue to encourage induction of our scientific people to the EAOS, if for no other reason then to monitor those fuckers, and mos timportantly of all, maintain our ties to the Accord."

04:02:04 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:02:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I agree Ather so it would bepretty serious business and they better be pretty certain that they want to break a NAP for no justifiable reason."

04:02:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bam. Debate ended. Now all of you go back to your boxes."

04:02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This isn't any other alliances problem, not yet anyways. It's up to us. Thse are our homeworlds."

04:02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, That's definintely something we need to do. We need to all stand together and let the government know why these things are important."

04:03:04 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:03:25 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:03:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ather yep I agree and we definitely need to make a statement."

04:03:30 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:03:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, like I said. At the enxt meeting, we could propose and write up a joint statement from the entire AEU pilot corps, saying everything I just said in nicer more flowery words. We cna have Lambeth attend the meeting so that he can get it first-hand, and communicate it directly to the government."

04:03:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Artifact (nearest).

04:03:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:04:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I agree Eli."

04:04:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "We bring in most of our homeworld's money the government can't survive without money. What would they do if we stopped working for them? Until our voices were heard and taken into account?"

04:04:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Are we all in agreement? Good! Now everyone stop sniping at each other. We're a fucking alliance. Start working with one another rather than blasting one another's opinions."

04:04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Amen Ather."

04:04:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey whistles.

04:04:50 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:04:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep I suppose they do forget that aspect especially that I probably have enough credits in my pocket which would easily exceed most planet's budgets."

04:05:01 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:05:09 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:05:10 Lily Kaise places a plain white spacesuit helmet atop her head.

04:05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I apologize if I did that to anyone. I certainly respect your opinions folks."

04:05:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The AEU treasury has I think about 6 trillion in it?"

04:05:23 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:05:23 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise exclaim, "Yes I will wager 121 billion on it so there!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes I will wager 121 billion on it so there!"

04:05:33 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:05:33 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Cuckle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Cuckle."

04:05:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "They want to shut us off from everyone, but why would we allow such a thing? We may not be all buddy buddy with everyone, but what if we went on some sort of strike?"

04:05:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, I don't suppose you are aware of the fact that the government has control of those assets and can take them anytime they want to from you. It's probably best not to go around saying these things in public."

04:05:43 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:05:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:05:45 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:05:52 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to yellow.

04:05:56 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to red.

04:06:01 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:06:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Uh ok. I'm going to shut up now before I find myself slapped in the face by a fish... or fine."

04:06:29 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "I'd probably have 150 billion in my pocket had I not given a lot to others and personally funded other projects."

04:06:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'd probably have 150 billion in my pocket had I not given a lot to others and personally funded other projects."

04:06:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah for the record, I'm against a strike even if it was a viable option. There's too many people that aren't a part of this that depend on those resources."

04:06:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ryo, it's too soon to even contemplate something like a strike. The best course of action right now, is the joint statement. Make that, see what the government makes of it, then proceed from there based on what they decide."

04:07:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Valid point and yeah. I jumpped in the deep end. Remind me to never speak when just waking up."

04:07:37 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "It's ok Ryo you have as much right as anyone to be heard."

04:07:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's ok Ryo you have as much right as anyone to be heard."

04:07:43 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:07:49 A small light on the airlock door turns from red to yellow.

04:07:54 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to green.

04:07:58 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:08:01 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

04:08:10 Lily Kaise puts a dense dodecahedron-shaped metallic mass into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

04:08:15 You put a gentle kiss on Lily Kaise's space suit helmet.

04:08:15 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:08:19 You put a gentle kiss on Lily Kaise's space suit helmet.

04:08:20 Lily Kaise removes a plain white spacesuit helmet from her head.

04:08:23 I don't understand that.

04:08:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "So when's this meeting kim wants to have."

04:08:24 You chuckle.

04:08:26 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:08:29 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:08:37 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:08:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, it had to be postponed due to the expedition, and she has not yet set another date."

04:08:43 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:08:50 Lily Kaise says, "Vernos is so brainwashed."

04:08:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose I can write her a letter about it if no one else wants to."

04:09:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I can, I was going to talk to her when she wakes up anyways."

04:09:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I'd say me, but flowers and me don't mix."

04:09:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm usually still awake when she gets up."

04:09:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes, but I can write letters better than you, glowboy."

04:09:51 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:09:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily chuckles at Ryo

04:10:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, my penmenship's not that bad."

04:10:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

04:10:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh go be a nightlight."

04:10:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And besides, you did offer to let someone else do it."

04:10:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll write the letter. You can expand upon it."

04:10:31 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:10:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep Eli if you can communicate on her level, go for it."

04:10:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am not trying to be rude but I wanted folks to understand that as is, the current administration is really seeking out loyalists for the corps and I thought you should know that."

04:10:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

04:10:56 Lily Kaise says, "Seriously Vernos shut the fuck up."

04:11:04 Lily Kaise says, "He is such a wanna bee."

04:11:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like I said, I was just going to talk to her in person when she got up anyways, so go ahead."

04:11:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Loyal is good, but there's a difference between loyal and blindly following."

04:11:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We know this, and there is nothing wrong with that, either. We want loyalists to the corps. I'm sick of the fucking sabotaging dicks we've had in the past like Tatiana, Takana, Nils, Kesi, Kaite, Elizabeth etc."

04:11:24 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:11:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "True and none of us are that type."

04:11:46 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:11:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Explorers are not sheep followers."

04:12:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I thought many would want AEU loyalists, not just loyalists to Best."

04:12:04 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:12:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or shepherd followers to be more specific."

04:12:50 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:13:09 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:13:26 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:13:28 You say, "I know."

04:15:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do they specifically say loyalists to Best when they say they're seeking out loyalists? Or are you just assuming?"

04:15:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "When I was interviewed it felt like they wanted loyalists to the ruling party."

04:15:58 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:16:00 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:17:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I said I would do what was in the best interests of the alliance so that we could move forward from our previous mistakes."

04:17:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:17:21 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

04:17:23 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

04:17:25 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

04:17:27 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

04:17:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then it seems that they are not just looking for loyalists to the current dominent party, or you wouldn't have become a pilot."

04:17:32 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

04:17:34 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

04:17:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

04:58:37 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:58:47 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:58:47 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:58:51 The starship has left a unique area of space.

04:58:57 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

04:59:06 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:59:07 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Passively Beaconed Autonavigating Recharging Battery-Powered Transmitter in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:00:07 Listen. You need to be careful.

06:01:54 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:02:49 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

06:02:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:02:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:02:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:02:55 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:02:56 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

06:02:56 You're already sitting.

06:02:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:02:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:03:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:03:00 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:03:03 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

06:03:03 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

06:03:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

06:03:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:03:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:03:26 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

06:03:29 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:03:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

06:03:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:03:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:03:43 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

06:03:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:03:45 Lily Kaise glides out.

06:03:47 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:03:47 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

06:03:49 You scramble to your feet.

06:03:49 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

06:03:50 You exit the ship.

06:03:50 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

06:04:06 Please do not enter so many commands at once.

06:04:07 [Pilot Organization Level; Organization Center]

06:04:07 This room appears to be filled with friendship and camaraderie. Pilots frequently come together in pairs and exchange firm handshakes. Others form whole groups and cheer each other on, slapping each other on the back. A line of terminals along one wall allow other pilots to join in on the action.
You can go east.

06:05:05 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:10:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:10:29 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

06:10:43 Lily Kaise says to you, "Did you go to the org center yet?"

06:10:49 You say, "Yep, I did."

06:10:58 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok then off to Orion we go!"

06:11:01 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

06:11:01 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:11:02 You grin.

06:11:04 Lily Kaise grins.

06:11:08 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:11:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

06:11:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:11:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:11:24 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:11:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:11:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:11:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

06:11:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:11:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:11:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:11:34 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: W>F?k(B%xMK-68>cFp^nz"$]i3/<[39L8;Mr=rUm
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:11:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:11:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:11:44 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:11:53 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2807 light-minutes per second from Galactic West and Very Slightly Up."

06:11:53 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise exclaims, "That letter was from Johann. They got to 10k Industry and 3k Command. That is awesome for LIBS!"

06:11:56 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

06:12:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Xenological Solar Temporary Station.

06:12:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:12:18 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 2,485,966.03 credits.

06:12:21 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Remind me not to drink that stuff anymore Morris. That was potent."

06:12:26 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald" has launched from League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station; Docking Bay.

06:12:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's sposed to be."

06:12:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I know."

06:12:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:12:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pretty good for forgettin your troubles."

06:12:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:12:42 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

06:12:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

06:12:47 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yeah."

06:12:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And everythin else while you're at it."

06:12:55 Lily Kaise glides out.

06:12:56 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:12:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:12:57 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

06:16:42 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

06:16:43 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

06:16:43 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go south and out.

06:16:50 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:16:52 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

06:16:55 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:17:00 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:17:01 You exclaim, "Such terrible applicants!"

06:17:03 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

06:17:04 I can't find "ouch."

06:17:06 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:17:08 A launch trajectory is located.

06:17:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:17:14 I don't understand that.

06:17:17 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

06:17:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:17:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:17:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:17:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

06:17:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:17:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:17:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:17:28 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:17:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

06:17:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:17:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:17:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:17:33 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:17:36 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

06:17:44 Lily Kaise says, "Ok will leave the ship on the landing pad to see if can do anything."

06:17:49 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

06:17:50 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

06:17:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:18:04 Lily Kaise says, "There is some data stored."

06:18:19 You say, "Ah, ok."

06:18:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:18:25 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

06:18:28 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:18:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

06:18:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:18:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:18:41 Lily Kaise glides out.

06:18:43 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:18:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

06:18:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise has automatically contributed 3,159,687.50 AEU credits.

06:19:57 You say, "I got 4.5 for those artifacts."

06:20:03 You say, "Points."

06:20:52 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I got about 9 points so let's see... it means I probably still get nearly a point per artifact out there."

06:21:06 You nod.

06:21:33 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

06:21:38 You say, "Yeah, I got about a point per artifact."

06:21:45 Lily Kaise says, "Well the org got 13 points so let's see."

06:22:29 Lily Kaise says, "Heh no idea but at least the org got a few so we just need 52 now."

06:22:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:22:34 You nod.

06:22:35 You grin.

06:22:44 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

06:22:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:22:59 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway Love I must go try to sleep now."

06:23:03 You say, "Me too."

06:23:07 Lily Kaise smiles.

06:23:08 You say, "Let's go to bed."

06:25:02 Lily Kaise says, "Well was odd as I went to submit the information from the databanks but it was a bit vague as to their response. Annoying since the data takes up some portion of thedatabank on this ship."

06:25:16 You nod. "That's strange and too bad."

06:25:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Anyway, as they say... was a learning experience!"

15:14:23 There are two board posts.

15:14:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

15:14:25 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock.

15:17:01  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.

Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

15:17:02 You are carrying nothing.

15:19:16 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

15:21:16 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

15:28:16 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the south.

15:32:54 I don't see that here.

15:32:57 You stroke the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

15:32:57 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

16:14:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
16:14:00 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go south and out.

16:14:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:14:05 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:14:14 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:14:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:14:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:14:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:14:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:14:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:14:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

16:14:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:14:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:14:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:14:43 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

16:14:46 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to Mir."

16:14:49 "7 7 7" does not match any known sector.

16:15:01 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 5,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

16:15:01 [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:15:03 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

16:15:03 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 997,088.78 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

16:15:05 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

16:15:05 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

16:15:15 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:47:36 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

16:47:36 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:47:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Recharging Battery-Powered Transmitter.

16:47:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:48:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:48:53 You begin the docking sequence.

16:48:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

16:49:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:49:18 You peer out...

16:49:19 
[League Recharging Battery-Powered Transmitter; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The four-person space constructor "Herding Cats" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are parked here.
You can go north, up, and down.

16:49:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:49:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:49:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:49:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:49:33 There appear to be 11 pilots recently active.

16:49:36 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:49:37 You exit the ship.

16:49:58 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

16:50:00 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

16:50:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Transmitter; Docking Bay.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, an early warning space defense device, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

17:07:13 You're already sitting.

17:07:19  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case.

You can go south and out.

22:19:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:19:07 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

22:19:15 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

22:19:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:19:31 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

22:19:36 A launch trajectory is located.

22:19:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:19:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:20:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Nice!"

22:20:17 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.

22:20:27 Lily Kaise says, "Wow wait."

22:20:40 Lily Kaise says, "It already says the probe studys have been completed."

22:20:43 You say, "Oh."

22:20:47 You say, "Darn."

22:20:48 Lily Kaise says, "Weird."

22:21:35 Lily Kaise says, "Huh I don't get it but let's try the spectrascope for grins."

22:21:47 Lily Kaise pulls down the aftermarket control board for the spectography and analysis equipment, flips a few switches, then presses a prominent button.

22:21:47 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

22:22:47 The computer finishes deleting the partial data from its optical spectography program.

22:23:17 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

22:23:47 Lily Kaise glides south.

22:24:03 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

22:24:17 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

22:24:26 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo.

22:24:26 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

22:24:34 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:26:36 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "EAOS."

22:26:49 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

22:27:03 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "As expected."

22:27:07 Lily Kaise returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:27:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo. Go Fienstein!"

22:27:14 Lily Kaise says, "Sad how very sad."

22:27:17 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "What is it? I'm in battlesuit."

22:27:26 Lily Kaise says, "I sure do not Blame him."

22:27:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Fienstein renounced his AEU citizenship."

22:27:43 Lily Kaise says, "If I were imortant enough, I'd... well I'd."

22:27:47 Lily Kaise says, "Important."

22:27:53 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

22:28:14 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Wow."

22:28:37 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I think this isn't going to do much."

22:28:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like Ali said, not unexpected."

22:28:42 Lily Kaise says, "So hmm."

22:29:34 Lily Kaise says, "I think I'll take us spinward for a bit."

22:29:48 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

22:29:48 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 90.0, 2.0.

22:30:04 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

22:30:04 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:30:14 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:30:14 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:30:15 The starship has left a unique area of space.

22:30:15 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

22:30:24 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

22:31:09 Lily Kaise says, "Flow isn't exactly in our favor."

22:31:20 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

22:32:56 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Please leave a message. In a suit."

22:33:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Holy crap like 7 heavy fighters in the deep wastes. Oh never mind, someone is here. Fighting them."

22:35:36 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Oops."

22:35:48 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Damn buttons."

22:40:57 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

22:41:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "An<body%need Starseekers?}arts w`i;e}I'm at Accord?"

22:44:20 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches out.

22:46:55 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

22:47:20 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
