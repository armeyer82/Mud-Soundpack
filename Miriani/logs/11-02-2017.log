12:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:21 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:21 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:21 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

12:21 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:21 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:21 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:21 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:21 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:21 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:21 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:21 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and four space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:21 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:22 The ten-person battlecruiser "Creature" has left the sector.

12:22 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

12:22 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:22 The starship is already moving.

12:22 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:22 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:22 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

12:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:22 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist.

12:22 You are carrying nothing.

12:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:23 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:23 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

19:04 [Pinnacle; Master Suite Living Room] (indoors) (sitting on a wicker sectional sofa)
You see nothing special.
You see two peach glass end tables, a wicker sectional sofa, a glass coffee table with an emerald green spring rain scented candle sitting on top of it, a peach suede love seat, a wicker rocking chair, a transparent architectural design simulator, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, Maggie the bot, a medium sandstone fireplace with a tile harth and a cedar mantel, and a shiny blue starship simulator here.
You can go northwest, northeast, and south.

19:04 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a red archaeological artifact storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

You can go south and out.

19:06 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:06 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

19:06 You can't launch from here.

19:06 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

19:06 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

19:06 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

19:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

19:06 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

19:06 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

19:06 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

19:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:06 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:06 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:06 The starship must be in space.

19:06 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

19:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

19:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:06 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

19:06 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

19:07 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:07 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:07 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

19:07 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

19:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

19:07 You must stand up first.

19:07 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

20:49 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:49 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:49 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:49 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:49 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

20:50 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:50 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

20:50 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

20:50 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

20:50 #$#hjelp

20:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

20:50 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:50 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

20:50 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:50 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:49 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

21:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta] (indoors)
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the seven-person expeditioner "Ventures", the ten-person battlecruiser "Palace of Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion", the eight-person gunship "Kingdom Harts", the six-person destroyer "Swic", the three-person antagonizer "Mean Machine", and the six-person destroyer "Pop Goes The Prailer" landed here.

22:40 You sit down on a black leather recliner with rubies in the arms.

22:40 You lean back comfortably in a black leather recliner with rubies in the arms.

22:40 Your chair doesn't have a seatbelt.

22:40 You peer northwest and see...

22:40 ["Pop Goes The Prailer" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white tiled floor. You see a polished circular mirror in a smooth ebony frame carved with vines and a wooden frame containing a picture of Ralph the Monkey triumphantly holding up a banana hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see a marble window box, a cream plush rug, a compact black refrigerator, an elegant cream engineer's chair, a gray bamboo waste basket, a large wooden table with a centerpiece of a holographic star system, and an internal stun turret here.

22:40 Therman Donaldson's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "howdy all"

22:40 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "hello"

22:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:41 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

22:42 Therman Donaldson's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Yeah he never slips but he has the drive installed. Maybe it for looks."

22:42 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

22:42 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

22:42 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

22:42 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

22:42 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

22:42 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

22:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:42 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

22:42 You say nothing. Good job.

22:42 I don't understand that.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

23:23 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

23:23 No communication link with that name could be found.

23:24 Jessica Marin's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "all room is full"

23:24 No communication link with that name could be found.

23:25 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:25 [Private | Katherine Black] Katherine Black transmits, "yes"

23:25 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:25 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:25 [Private | Katherine Black] You transmit, "Congrats."

23:25 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:25 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:25 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:25 [Private | Katherine Black] Katherine Black transmits, "thanks"

23:26 Amy Draksen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "for those of you new to this, there will be a fleet of ships to contend with, then the atmo and"

23:26 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:26 Hunter Trask's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I looked up the manual about atmospheric combat. Sounds complicated."

23:26 Allon Martellato's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "It's no worse than flying a solo, really"

23:26 Amy Draksen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "not as bad as it reads, if you get passed the intimidation"

23:26 Hunter Trask's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Well if you're willing to let me blow up one or two, I'll give it a shot."

23:26 Amy Draksen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "the only thing that's really different is the weaponry"

23:27 Amy Draksen snickers over the intercom.

23:27 The computer announces, "Activate."

23:27 You hear a sharp whine coming from the wormhole drive as a brilliant splash of magenta light pours in from the window. You detect the brief pull of acceleration as the starship is plunged through the quantum vacuum.

23:27 Swirls of magenta and cyan light flicker on the walls as the starship continues its transition through the very fabric of the universe.

23:27 Without warning, the overhead lights suddenly increase to maximum illumination as the windows darken to complete black. The computer announces, "Realspace transition in progress."

23:27 The artificial gravity, along with the contents of your stomach, momentarily fluctuates as the starship translates back into normal space, returning illumination and window opacity to standard levels.

23:27 The computer announces, "Quantum vacuum transition complete. All systems nominal."

23:27 Amy Draksen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "say aye if you have done atmo combat before"
