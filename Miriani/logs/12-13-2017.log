["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Atmospheric Salvaging
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Atmospheric salvaging is quite similar to regular salvaging, except that you are salvaging atmospheric components instead of debris. Atmospheric salvaging involves taking control of an atmospheric salvaging ship and bringing it into the atmosphere, where you will collect atmospheric components, which you will later be able to sell. There are three types of salvagers, regular atmospheric salvagers, gas giant salvagers, and aquatic salvagers. To operate a salvager, you should find an applicable planet, move within one unit of it, and launch your vehicle into the atmosphere. Be warned that if your ship is left unattended, it may be attacked at any time. Your salvager will notify you when the mothership is locked on, fired on, or switches to purple alert.

  The basics:
To start atmospheric salvaging, you'll need several things. The most important of which is a ship with a docking bay. To find out what ship classes come with docking bays, you can type INFO at a starship store to see information about each ship class. Look for one with "Yes" under the Dock column. Also be sure your ship has a cargo hold that is capable of holding cargo (for example, a Carrier cannot hold any cargo and would not be a good choice for this endeavour).

Next, you'll need to purchase a vehicle docking bay and an atmospheric or gas giant salvager. You can f
04:12 ind these at any atmospheric salvager store. Don't be shy if you can't find one, someone on the comms should be able to help you locate one. You can also use the MAP command to see a map of whatever planet you're on.

  Salvaging - the regular way:
Now that you have everything you need to get started, you can enter your ship and LAUNCH it. Fly to a planet, any planet with an atmosphere, and maintain an orbit within one unit of the planet. Head down to your docking bay and type GO HATCH. You will now be in your vehicle docking bay, where you can ENTER the SALVAGER. Please note that only one person will fit in an atmospheric salvager. You can now LAUNCH the salvager into the planet's atmosphere.
Now, before you start salvaging, there's a few things you should know. First, you can type SM to check your map, just like a ship. This will show you a map of the current level, what level you're on and how much charge your salvager has remaining. Salvagers have a limited power supply, so you need to keep a constant eye on the power levels, otherwise you may crash and lose your salvager and anything you have salvaged.
Do you see the ":" symbols on the starmap? Those are the components that you need to salvage. You can move to them using the standard manual starship movement commands and just pass over them to collect them. The command + will bring your salvager higher. You can also use - to go lower. If you are already on the high
04:12 est level, - will return you to your ship. As you move further down into the atmosphere, your chance of finding better materials increases. However, keep in mind that this will also use your power up faster, so keep a close eye on your power levels.
Once your salvager is full, return to your ship and you can TRANSFER the components like any other debris.

  Salvaging - gas giants:
Gas giants are planets which consist (almost) only of gasses and are therefore a valuable resource for salvagers. They can be found anywhere outside of the charted sectors. To salvage from a gas giant you need a different salvager than the one you would use for salvaging from a regular planet, however they can be bought from the same store.
Finding a gas giant can take a while. You can LAUNCH your starship and search yourself or ask on the comms to find out if someone already knows of a good planet. Once you found a planet, fly your starship next to it and go to your docking bay. From there you can GO through the HATCH of the vehicle bay, ENTER your SALVAGER and LAUNCH it. The principles described for atmospheric salvaging are the same for gas giant salvaging, except that the risks are higher, but so is the reward.
Generally, you will find that the vehicle's upgrades are more expensive and add less, and that you have to take more effort to get to a suitable planet. A gas giant is a dangerous place to work on, and so the vehicle required is much more complicated.

  Salvaging marine planets
Aquatic salvaging is just like gas giant salvaging in that you orbit the target planet and launch your salvager in the air. The commands are the same, and so is the risk factor. The only difference is that you need a special aquatic salvager to get the job done. There is also a requirement of 1000 pieces of atmospheric debris salvaged to purchase the salvagers. While salvaging in a marine planet, you will encounter life forms that enter your craft. These are called pufferfish, and a tops list has been added. You can check this by typing @PUFFERFISH or @TOP-PUFFERFISH. The number of pufferfish you've salvaged can also be found in INFO ACHIEVEMENTS (INFO ACH for short). Finally, your craft might encounter life forms in the water that take hostile action against a foreign being in their home. These forms will slam into your craft and go about their merry way, leaving the salvager slightly damaged. Please note that the aquatic landing upgrade is not required to do aquatic salvaging, as you don't actually land on the planet.

  Repairing gas giant and aquatic salvagers
As mentioned above gas giant and aquatic salvaging is much more dangerous than regular, atmospheric salvaging. It is therefore not unlikely that your salvager will get damaged while you are salvaging, especially if you move further away from your ship. The computer will inform you in the event of such a dangero
04:12 us situation. You can also type STATUS to check the current damage level.
If your salvager sustained damage you can use a tube of repair paste to fix the problem. These tubes can be bought from the same store that sells the salvagers. Once you bought a tube, USE it in the cockpit of your salvager to repair it. Finally, note that, like charge boosters and replacement hatch locks, you shouldn't buy massive amounts at once. If you will not have access to a salvager store for a longer period of time and fear that you will run out of repair paste, consider staying closer to your starship while salvaging. While this means you will not earn as much money it also reduces the chance that your salvager gets damaged.

  Sharing:
You can share an atmospheric salvager with a friend by authorizing them to use the vehicle. To do this, you must meet the following conditions and perform the following actions:
  1. You must be inside the vehicle's cockpit.
  2. Your friend must be standing outside of the vehicle in the vehicle bay.
  3. You then type: AUTHORIZE <person>

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Additional Information: The runabout class, a basic design shared by all alliances, has been boosted
using alien technology that researchers discovered. After researching several
alien hull plates and field emitters, AIE scientists were able to create a new
EM field "skin" that will rest along a specially modified hull. The goal began
as a way to shield the craft against excessive damage, but had the unexpected
side effect of repelling proximity weapons and displacing them into alternate
coordinates, potentially damaging any starships in the vicinity. Research on a
shield has yielded no results of yet, but the AIE runabout is a formidable
opponent against forces who rely on proximity weapons to damage vessels.

Upgrades: Subwarp Drive, Galactic Map Unit, and Wavewarp Drive
Additional Information: The Transverser boasts the next step in propulsion technology
the wavewarp drive. Using the wavewarp technology, the starship "rides" through space using
rapidly generated energy pulses which propel the ship forward. Unfortunately (or
fortunately, depending on your purposes), this energe pulse causes a shockwave
which will damage any nearby starships or small objects. This technology is
frowned upon for regular use, as it damages anything in its path indiscriminately, but it can be a valuable tool for the explorer in a pinch. A patch is
required for the wavewarp drive to function within the NAVI system.

this starship lacks is weaponry, as it was designed for exploration rather than
combat.

ship boasts an advanced sensory system which allows for the early detection and,
consequently, avoidance of large obstacles that might catch any other starship
by surprise in uncharted space. In addition, it comes standard with ten days of
charge, a subwarp drive, a slip drive, and ample storage space. The only area
this starship lacks is weaponry, as it was designed for exploration rather than
combat.

05:25 Jenaia the droid

05:25 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying a bright turquoise cooler in her right hand.

06:04 Jenaia the droid gives Kitty Mars a massive hug.

06:04 Jenaia the droid

06:04 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying an old oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen in her left hand.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

11:27 A letter

11:27 
Bonjour Tibo,
I just woke up and read your files. It broke my heart. But that is not your fault, i don't try to accuse you doing that. Though I thought about all that a lot before writing you this letter and I asked so many questions to myself. What did I do wrong? Didn't you tell me you love me and that it will be forever? Why did you get back together with Kitty, the one who hurt you and me, the one who insulted us all the time and who caused a lot of sorrow? Don't you think of our child, how shall he or she grow up without the love of her Papa? Why did everything fall apart, our dreams, our hopes, our wishes, or did they come only from my side? And why was your letter so cold, without any emotions or explanations?
I wish i could understand that and put my thoughts in order, I wish someone could soothe my pain. I wish I could have been able to wake up earlier. I guess I lost you to Kitty. But one thing makes me look up a bit, a part of you will always be with me, our child. I love and will always love you, and I wish you the best, too. I so hope you will at least come over to see your child when he or she is born. I will never forget you. I had the most wonderful time in my life with you.
Maybe it is stupid, but I won't give you up.
Forever yours,
Miriam

11:28 A letter

Hey Tibo,
This morning I felt our baby moving the first time. It made me so sad that I couldn't take your hand and put it on my stomach so you could feel it too, the life that we both created. I woke up and looked for you, but you weren't next to me. I don't sleep in a bed anymore because I don't support the emptiness. I don't know when you will come back and what will happen if you do. You will read my letters, but maybe it won't change anything. Maybe you loved Kitty all the time, maybe you knew it but didn't want to tell me, or maybe you didn't even know it yourself. You didn't even take time to get over me I guess... or maybe you didn't get over me and you just don't want to be alone. I wish I could feel what you think so things get easier.
I write you even though I know that you won't read the letters until you come back, but I hope it will prove you how much I think of you. I love you, and somehow I hate you for leaving me alone. Love wins most of the time though. I have the hate and the rage more for Kitty, I had it all the time but the situation enforces it. Now she didn't even deserve it, she didn't do anything actually, other than getting you back, because I was not there for you. I guess she doesn't even know about our child. Actually I understand her. She must love you very much, that made her do all that, now that I am in her situation that makes sense. Anyhow I wouldn't say the things about her she said abo
11:28 ut me.
Maybe I should give up and leave you with her, she might make you happier than I do. But I can't, I can't give you up, because of my strong feelings for you, and because of our child. Because of our dreams, and because of our promise. We wanted to marry, and marriage means through better and worse. I just can't give you up that easily.
Tu es l'homme de ma vie et de mon coeur, je t'aimerai pour toujours. Tu es mon seul espoir, je suis qui je suis puisque tu m'aimais et sans toi, je ne suis plus moi.
Yours,
Miriam

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone he

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet 
12:46 medical drone, a compact black security drone, Am the droid, Ma the droid, a sleek black hovercraft, a transparent blue security drone, a transparent pink medical drone, Kara the droid, Katherine the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here

Tradesman Certificates
--------------------------------------------------
Tradesman item certificates are a method for a donator to redeem a request to use at a later date. Such requests are placed into a secondary queue, and do not take priority over items requested on Empanda Station. They can also be gifted to other players if you're feeling generous enough! It doesn't matter if the recipient of the gift is a donator or not. It may also be worth noting that the exchange and use of tradesman certificates is out of character, thus you can use and obtain them anywhere in the game except for locations that reside out of communications range (but can't talk about them via IC communication).
Furthermore, tradesman certificates may only be submitted once every two weeks. If you submit a tradesman item certificate and it is completed a day later, you may not submit another one for up to two weeks after that time. Rejections do not incur a waiting period.
 
Commands:
  @CGIVE <person>
Give <person> a tradesman certificate. Once you have selected a player to gift, you will be prompted for the amount of tradesman certificates you wish to transfer. You can't give more than you have in your account. Typing the command without arguments will prompt you for a player's name. Once complete, you'll see something like:
        You give 1 tradesman certificate to Mitchell Morganivich Mihola.
The recipient will see:
        Mitchell
14:58  Morganivich Mihola has just given you 1 tradesman certificate.
 
  @CREQUEST
Request an item using one of your available certificates. You will be presented with a menu, similar to the one that appears in the Empanda Station tradesman concourse. You must have at least one tradesman certificate to utilize this command. For sake of immersion, this command cannot be utilized while out of communications range. Complete all tradesman requests prior to leaving local space.
 
  @REQUEST-CERT
Redeem a certificate. You will be prompted to confirm the request, and once complete, a tradesman item certificate will be added to your account.
 
  @CERT-MARKET
Enter the tradesman item certificate marketplace. You can sell or buy tradesman certificates here for credits. The command may be shortened down to @CM for brevity. Be warned that trades are not audited by the Toastsoft hosts. Confirm at your own risk!
You may also type @CM [on | off] to connect or disconnect from the tradesman market channel. Notifications of new and completed sales are announced here.
 
  REQUESTCHECK
See if you're eligible to request a donator item. Note: similarly to the commands above, this command is out of character.
 
Notes:
* Tradesman certificates are attached to your account, not your character. This means they stay with you through rerolls.
* If your request is rejected, you will receive a tradesman certificate redemption token in the mai

15:43 ["Barracuda" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The eight-person gunship "Barracuda" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

15:43 Miriam Valleris examines a display containing the starship's status report.

15:44 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:44 Miriam Valleris presses a small green button labeled 'About'.

It was manufactured on December 6th, 2362 at the ISC Starship Construction Depot Delta and commissioned by the Interstellar Shipbuilding Corporation. The vessel came under licensed control on November 1st, 2363 and is presently licensed to Tibo Beauchene."

15:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Barracuda, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:44 Miriam Valleris smiles.

15:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:44 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

15:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:44 Miriam Valleris says, "I want to give you money to upgrade that"

15:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:44 Those coordinates are currently occupied.

15:44 Miriam Valleris stands up.

15:44 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

15:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:44 Miriam Valleris says, "Since I killed yours"

15:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:44 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:44 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

15:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Barracuda. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet 
17:22 medical drone, a compact black security drone, Am the droid, Ma the droid, a sleek black hovercraft, a transparent blue security drone, a transparent pink medical drone, Kara the droid, Katherine the droid, Mekensie the droid, and Kitty the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

19:10 ["Fire And Ice" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

19:10 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

19:10 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

A trail of shiny gold tiles create a pathway through plush cream carpet from the rotating glass doors at the entrance to a large marble reception desk poised along the back wall of the lobby. In the center of the room is a white stone fountain, the polished tiles surrounding the fountain in a soft cloud of pale gold. Wall-mounted flower pots hold an array of lush flowers, their delicate petals spilling over the edge of the containers to trail lazily down the wine red wallpaper. An enormous painting of the apartment grounds hangs above the reception desk, and a bank of gold-trimmed elevators in the corner sends out a melodious chime each time the cart arrives on the lobby level.
