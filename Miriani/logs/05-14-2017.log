00:06 [Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay]
A truly brilliant sight is visible just outside of the large glass dome. An ocean of lava surrounds the entire spaceport. Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.
You see the one-person cargo transport "Seraphim Biotechnology 4335" powered down here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.
You see a sign with directions and Ix the droid here.
You can go north, east, west, and down.

00:13 ["Freedom Fighter" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a fuzzy yellow security drone, a fuzzy red security drone, a compact blue security drone, a rotating alien bone showcase with a device flashing numerous alien symbols mounted above the doors, and a realistic looking hovering kookaburra gadget bot here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay.

00:56 [Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay]
A truly brilliant sight is visible just outside of the large glass dome. An ocean of lava surrounds the entire spaceport. Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.

A truly brilliant sight is visible just outside of the large glass dome. An ocean of lava surrounds the entire spaceport. Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.
You see the one-person cargo transport "Seraphim Biotechnology 4335" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow" powered down here.
You see the six-person dart "Sola Scriptura", the ten-person battlecruiser "Assailance", the ten-person battlecruiser "Stupify", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.
You see a sign with directions and Ix the droid here.
You can go north, east, west, and down.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay.

Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.
You see the one-person cargo transport "Seraphim Biotechnology 4335" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow" powered down here.
You see the six-person dart "Sola Scriptura" and the six-person destroyer "Passport To Hell" landed here.
You see a sign with directions and Ix the droid here.
You see Olivia Cantrell here.
You can go north, east, west, and down.

A truly brilliant sight is visible just outside of the large glass dome. An ocean of lava surrounds the entire spaceport. Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.
You see the one-person cargo transport "Seraphim Biotechnology 4335" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow" powered down here.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay.

A high-pitched, wobbling alarm sounds as the hull begins breaking up around you.
The computer announces, "Crisis alert! Starship destruction imminent. Beginning emergency evacuation of all personnel."

02:19 You are suddenly seized by a powerful EM field and deposited into an escape pod.

02:19 Noah Holland puts a salvage container in a stylish navy blue leather backpack with black comfortable straps and a red zip front pocket.

02:19 The sound of strained components echos throughout the pod. It sounds as if it's going to break apart altogether.

02:20 From a thick white leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a red flight control scanner announce, "Penjulum to Omnivincere flight control, we're detecting weapon signatures out there."

02:20 With one final burst of acceleration, the pod emerges from the wormhole and begins accelerating through space under the power of the relativity drive.

02:20 Kylar Knight says, "so the next question is"

02:20 Kylar Knight asks, "do we dare try to go back in an expiditer?"

02:20 You feel mild acceleration as the pod descends.

02:20 Kylar Knight says, "it's on angelus but"

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

A tall hexagonal terminal dominates the center of this busy starship store. On each of its six faces, various models of starships move about through a starry backdrop of space. A sign above the terminal directs customers to tap the starship of their choice to make a purchase. Tucked into a corner at the front of the store, a middle age woman sits behind a tall counter with a stack of papers arranged neatly before her. Lining the walls and situated on tables throughout the store are working models of the various exploration class starships.

02:46 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

03:35 You peer west and see...
["Thanatos" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a pale blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Ariela Brennar, a small flat disc containing the image of Jessica Yobi, a small flat disc containing the image of Chase Brennar, a small flat disc containing the image of "Thanatos" Control Room, a small flat disc containing the image of Anton Yobi, a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus, and a small flat disc containing the image of a fuzzy creature hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Outreach; Landing Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a pale blue fluffy rug, a comfortable pale turquoise velvet sofa accented by plump pillows, a furr
03:35 y trash can, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a dull blue starship simulator, a translucent architectural design simulator, three gleaming black security drones, a brightly-colored mechanical parrot, a glowing white marble statue of an arctic wolf with its head resting on its paws, a turquoise video camera, Chewy the droid, Reason the droid, Persuasion the droid, a compact blue medical drone, a compact blue security drone, Turkey the droid, and Lurky the droid here.
You see Gabriel Brennar, Ariela Brennar, and Jason Harkness here.
You can go east, south, and west.

[Outreach; Landing Bay]
Raised on a platform high above the city, the polycarbonate dome encircling Outreach Spaceport offers a truly spectacular view of the drab gray concrete and shiny metal below. The city extends as far as the eye can see, fading off into the distance. Starships flow steadily through the strategically-placed hatches in the dome, landing and taking off from raised platforms on the concrete floor. The standard spaceport amenities see a large amount of traffic to north, south, east and west, while pod stations at the corners of the outer ring provide transport to the city.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Golden Daylight" and the one-person cargo hauler "Imsry" powered down here.
You see the Hale evacuation ship "Thoron", the eight-person gunship "Redemption", the six-person destroyer "Valor", the ten-person battlecruiser "Valkyrie", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" landed here.
You see a sleek chrome-plated bench, Fudge the droid, Digby the droid, an automatic teller machine, Dodo the droid, Theo the droid, a large black suede rolling backpack with several compartments, a sleek black leather rolling backpack with a leather-covered handle, Rona the droid, Kira the droid, Eric the droid, Jouie the droid, Dada the droid, Sunny the droid, Edge the droid, Neo the droid, Brad the droid, Zeddicus the droid, Sharon the droid, Otis the droid, Luis the droid, Adolin the droid, Lenardo the droid, B

A truly brilliant sight is visible just outside of the large glass dome. An ocean of lava surrounds the entire spaceport. Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.
You see the one-person cargo transport "Seraphim Biotechnology 4335" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow" powered down here.

["Thanatos" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a pale blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Ariela Brennar, a small flat disc containing the image of Jessica Yobi, a small flat disc containing the image of Chase Brennar, a small flat disc containing the image of "Thanatos" Control Room, a small flat disc containing the image of Anton Yobi, a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus, and a small flat disc containing the image of a fuzzy creature hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is closed. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

12:08 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a leather-covered oak navigator's chair, a metallic white starship simulator, an overstuffed royal blue leather love seat, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.

12:15 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:15 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:15 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:15 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:15 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

12:15 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:15 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:15 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:15 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

12:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:16 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:34 ["Undying Dissidence" Weapons Room 3]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go west.

You see the four-person carrier "Carrier of Musical Moonlight" and the one-person cargo hauler "Junk" powered down here.
You see Serenity the droid, a huge red wooden arrow-shaped sign pointing northwest, Southgate the droid, and Jessee the droid here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
