Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot cheeseburger with the works.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.

you're done?"
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an
orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

Morris says to Melinda, "Terms like 'waking cycle'"
Morris Corlew gives a copy of "Handy Hints: Antispinward Trading" to Vernos
Bailey.

Melinda Michaels laughs. "I never read that book."
The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.
Morris says to Melinda, "It's..."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Melinda Michaels says, "Waking cycle is the cyle in which you are awake. In
other words, your waking hours."
Morris Corlew says, "Not 100% accurate about some things. But somewhat useful."
Vernos Bailey says, "I was thinking more for pilot terms for dummies."

book."

not interested in my take on the AEU upgrade book."
Morris Corlew asks, "Your take on the upgrade book?"
Vernos Bailey says, "I offered to take over since it sounded like he was tired
of doin git."
Vernos Bailey says, "Doing it I mean."
Morris Corlew says, "Ah, I see."
Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."
Morris Corlew asks, "I know it's got a couple things out of date, seems that'd
be a quick fix though?"
Vernos Bailey says, "Well I'd keep the arrow and the magnetar in there but on a
page at the back saying no longer manifactured due to lack of interest."
Vernos Bailey says, "That way it might generate interest."
Morris Corlew asks, "And he wanted to...just leave them out?"
Vernos Bailey says, "Well it was not discussed in significant detail, he says he
only trusts himself to wrte it."
Morris Corlew nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "Write it, damn I should do coffee before even attempting to
tallk."
Morris Corlew says, "I guess I'd be a bit hesitant about handin over one of my
books to somebody else though too."
The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.
Vernos Bailey says, "Oh I don't blame him for it at all."
Vernos Bailey says, "Not a single bit."
Morris Corlew nods.

"That's why I have folks proofread for me." Morris Corlew smiles. "Have had a
number of things fixed that way."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Melinda Michaels. "One of my favorite
proofreaders."
Vernos Bailey says, "Yes though, I would leave those two in the back with a note
on why they were stopped and what could potientally bring them back one day."
Morris Corlew asks, "Has the government given y'all an indication that it could
happen?"
Vernos Bailey says, "Not really but I think of Best as the type of man that
would support it if it helped the AEU."
Morris Corlew says, "Well..."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew says, "We might just have to agree to disagree on that one."
A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.
Vernos Bailey says, "Well I don't agree with some of his policies or ideas but
just perhaps he could be convinced through beneficial actions."
Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.
Vernos Bailey says, "I have been thinking about that a lot this trip."
Morris Corlew says, "Seems a lotta thinkin happens on these trips."
Morris Corlew smiles.
Vernos says to Morris, "Plus he has not banned exploration, so it has to fit
somewhere."
"Quite true." Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey. "Just...taken away the nice
toys. Makes me wonder...with his focus on military if y'all'll get some nice new
warships."
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
Vernos Bailey says, "Only he knows."
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
Morris Corlew nods.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Vernos Bailey says, "I will aim myself to make exploration important enough for
him to consider but without being extremeist."
Morris Corlew nods. "Extremism don't help things historically."
Vernos Bailey says, "No it does not."
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before
ducking back as the enemy returns fire.
A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red
glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
Morris Corlew says, "Nebula."
A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.
A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.
Vernos Bailey asks, "Go back for it?"
Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Not from Nissi's previous instructions."
Vernos Bailey nods.
Vernos Bailey asks, "What are we stopping for now?"
Morris Corlew says, "Probably planets. This close doubt we'd find much else like
neutron stars or pulsars or whatnot."
A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock
rifle slung over his shoulder.
A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red
glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
Vernos Bailey says, "I'd be interested in a trip to try and push 3000."
Morris Corlew nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "One to see if we could."
Vernos Bailey says, "And to see what we would find."
Morris Corlew nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "I bet you'd need at least the battery this ship has plus
three recharge stations."
Vernos Bailey says, "And a furnance."
Morris Corlew says, "Hmm. Even a mod transport with a siren battery would have
much less charge than this ship."
Morris Corlew says, "War galleon can only carry 7 station parts, same as a mod
scout, so that's only one station."
Vernos Bailey says, "Hm."
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings
stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.
Morris Corlew says, "With optimizations on the augmented explorer with the
uh...integration upgrade...you might be able to make that 3K."
Vernos Bailey asks, "You mean the goo?"
Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.
Morris Corlew says, "The longer someone is...interfaced with the ship, the lower
the drain rate due to optimizations they can...accomplish."
Morris Corlew says, "Anfisa could explain it much better than I could ever hope
to."
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the
glass, then it withdraws.
Vernos Bailey says, "I do wonder if with the help of a station or two could this
ship push 3000."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "Well...you would
have to pre-place stations using another ship. I'd have to double-check, but I'm
nearly certain this ship can't quite hold a mod scout."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor

Morris Corlew says, "Pretty sure a mod scout is 65 docking units. This ship will
hold 45."
Morris Corlew says, "Honestly not sure what battery either of the galleons that
can get that docking bay conversion to carry 7 station parts have. Pierre and
Nissi would know."

followed by some scraping sounds.

A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings

A dark shape flits past the viewport.
You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
Morris Corlew says, "Hum."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.

The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to
possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather
sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple
coffee table, a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the
small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald
green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a
large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a
shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with
embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor
pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red
paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored
posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and
round rocks, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a magician's top hat, and Manx
the little calico CatBot here.
Emily Ford is sleeping on a white leather sofa.
Vernos Bailey is sitting on a silky indigo cushion. Damien Goss is dozing. Jason
Rat and Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec are dozing on a white
leather sofa. Aisling the Fox is standing here. Eli Grey is sitting on a soft
square brown floor cushion. Rogue Romano is sitting on a large dark purple and
pale yellow flowered floor pillow. Anfisa the Wanderer, Nissi Valdaire, Melinda
Michaels, Cheri Lindbergh, and Ather Jammoa are sitting on a white leather sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with
thick silver fringe.)
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
Listen. You need to be careful.
