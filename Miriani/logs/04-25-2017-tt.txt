[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl,

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of mystic
purple suede clogs, a tight black t-shirt with a bright purple dragon
embroidered on the front, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, a pair of
blue corduroy jeans, and a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small
silver stars here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

Minor Change:
Some changes and additions to temporary space stations!
 - Temp stations now very belatedly use the new rescue pod system.
 - Docked ships will now be ejected into space when a station falls apart.
 - Some modules' point requirements have been altered to better match the
current levels and spread of accumulated organization points.
 - Some new top end modules have been added so that even the highest point
organizations can keep grinding!
 - There are now several levels of rift inserters, with higher levels being able
to insert larger ships. The basic inserter can insert scout-sized ships.
 - After being requested many times, quarters and galley side modules and a
lounge top module have been added. They are not very fancy, as one might expect.
Quarters work much as they do aboard ships.
