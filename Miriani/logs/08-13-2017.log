Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it li
06:13 ke any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

Communicators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Communicators are the basis for most communication in Miriani. Anyone with a communicator can talk to anyone else with a communicator, communicate privately with their alliance, or privately with their friends. They can be slightly complicated, however, so this guide aims to familiarize you with all of their functions!

  Transmission basics:
When you begin playing Miriani, you are given a receiver-only communicator. You will almost certainly want to replace it with a fully functional communicator. For instructions on doing this, please type HELP FAQ or HELP GETTING-STARTED. This document deals with operating your communicator, not obtaining one. You should replace anything in <less-than and greater-than> signs with your own text, not including the signs.

The most useful channel is the General Communication channel. Everyone in all three alliances has access to that one, making it extremely useful for discussing issues directly related to starship piloting. To transmit on it, you can type TRANSMIT GENERAL <MESSAGE>. This can be shortened to TRANS GEN or TR G for speed. There are some conditions associated with using this channel, so please read HELP COMMUNICATOR RULES before using it.

The second most commonly-used channel is the chatter channel. Everyone in the three alliances has access to this channel, making it very good for everyday chatter. To transmit on it, you can type TRANSMIT CHATTER <MESSAGE>. This can be shortened to TRANS CHAT or TR C for speed.

The third most commonly-used channel is the first private alliance channel. This channel allows you to communicate with members of only your own alliance, other people can't hear it. You can transmit on this channel using TRANSMIT 1 <MESSAGE>. As before, this can be shortened to TRANS 1 or TR 1.

But wait, there's more! You have a whole other nine alliance channels to transmit on! TR 2 will transmit on your alliance's trading channel. Channel 3 is your alliance's distress channel, and 4 is the exploration channel. Channels 5-10 are just regular old, numbered channels. To see a semi-complete list of channels you can access, type TR CHANNELS.

There's also an interalliance channel, which only exists when your alliance is at a full alliance treaty with another. If you have this nifty old alliance, you can type TR ALLIANCE <MESSAGE> or TR INT <MESSAGE>.

Just when you thought you could communicate no more, there is another channel for you to utilize, known as the short-range channel. When you type TRANSMIT SHORT-RANGE <MESSAGE> (or TR SHORT), your communicator will switch into short-range mode and transmit a message to any other communicator in the sector. This is valuable for those trips out of communications range where communicating is vital but not possible using standard beacons.

  Transmission tuning:
To save time, you can tune your communicator to transmit on one channel by default when you type TRANSMIT <MESSAGE>. By typing TRANSMIT TUNE <CHANNEL>, you will tune your communicator to that channel. Please be aware that you will NOT hear any other channels but that one and General Communication while your communicator is tuned! You can reset it to listen to all channels by typing TRANSMIT TUNE ALL.

  Private linked channels:
If you need a private way to communicate with friends or business partners, you can establish a private linked channel with them! Nobody else can see what you say on a linked channel, so you can be assured total privacy. There are several commands for dealing with linked channels, which will be listed when an explanation of each one following:
TRANSMIT LINKED [person] - If you don't include [person], this command will give you a list of everyone you have established a link with. If you do include a person's name, it will check to see if you have a private link with that person or not.
TRANSMIT LINKCOUNT - This tells you how many private links you have.
TRANSMIT LINK <PERSON> - This command will ask the target person if they would like to establish a link with you. If they accept, you will be linked.
TRANSMIT UNLINK <PERSON> (or DELINK) - This command will break the link with the target person.
TRANSMIT UNLINK ALL - This will terminate all of your private links.
TRANSMIT <PERSON> <MESSAGE> - This command will transmit a message over the private link with the target person, as long as you have established a link with them.
TRANSMIT HISTORY - Displays the last few messages transmitted over the general communications channel.
REPLY <message> - This command will send <message> to the last person who sent you a private transmission.
REPLYLOCK <person|off> - This command will lock your replies to a single individual. If you type REPLYLOCK OFF, it will go back to responding to the last person to send you a transmission. Typing REPLYLOCK with no arguments will tell you which mode you're currently in.
TRANSMIT HARDLINK <PERSON> - Establishes a matching alias that you can use for <PERSON>. This alias serves the dual purpose of becoming a command that you can type to quickly communicate with the person you're hardlinked with. For example, if you hardlink 'pal' to Joe Schmoe, from then on you can either type 'PAL HELLO!' or 'TR PAL HELLO!' to communicate with him.
TRANSMIT HARDLINK REMOVE - Remove a hardlink.

  Muting Channels:
TURN COMM - Deactivates your communicator, preventing sending/receiving.
MUTE COMM - Presents a menu of channels that can be muted.
UNMUTE COMM - The opposite of MUTE, this presents a menu of channels that can be unmuted.

  NOTE: If you disable the general communication channel, you may miss out on special host-run roleplaying events.

  Metafrequency Transmitters
There are also seperate communicators that you can buy called Metafrequency Transmitters. These are useful for talking to a small group of people. You can TUNE META TO <number from 1.0 to 500.0>. So for example, you could tune your communicator to the frequency 45.21 and then tell all your friends to tune to that channel too, and you can then all chat together without having to have everyone hear. However, there's always the chance, though small, that someone else can be on your frequency. You can transmit by typing USE META WITH [message].

Alternatively, you can use the command METAF [message]. If you have multiple metafrequency communicators, you can add a number after the command to specify which to use. For example, to speak into the second communicator you're wearing, you could type: METAF 2 HELLO WORLD.

There is also an experimental option available that will allow you to set an alias to use as a command for a particular channel. To activate this functionality, first type COMM-OPTIONS and select option 13 (Attempt to match unknown commands to metafrequency labels (WARNING: May cause lag. Who knows!)). Now, tune your metafrequency communicator to the channel you wish to alias and type LABEL <metafrequency communicator>. If you wish to assign more labels, tune your transmitter again and repeat the procedure. The label you assign will be the command that you type to communicate on that channel (assuming your transmitter is tuned to that channel). So for example, if you TUNE METAF TO 500, LABEL METAF, and type OOC, you can now type OOC <message> to speak on that channel.

Commands for experimental labels:
  LABEL <comm> - Assigns a label to the frequency the transmitter is tuned to. After you add a label, you can use that label as a command to transmit on the frequency. You can also use that label to match to your communicator. For example, if you label channel 500 'OOC', you can type 'OOC Hello!' to transmit hello and you can type "look ooc" to look at the communicator.
  UNLABEL <comm> - Removes a label.

Speaking of channel 500 (the unofficial OOC channel), you can view the complete history of all transmissions on that channel for the day at: http://toastsoft.net:1111/ooc_history/

  Ignoring People
Should you wish to ignore specific people, there is a selective hearing feature implemented. This is akin to your character plugging his or her ears while somebody is speaking and unplugging them when the transmissions ends.

IGNORE <name of person> - Adds or removes a person to/from your ignore list.
IGNORING - Displays a list of people you're ignoring.

  Emoting
Sometimes you want to laugh or cry. We have you covered. The following emotes are covered as a single message: laughs, giggles, chortles, snickers, cries, sobs, mumbles, coughs, snorts, groans, yawn, sigh, chuckel, cackle, laugh, begawk, moan, whisper, and sing.

06:15 
However, sometimes you may want to laugh AND say something. To do this, just add asterisks (*) around your emote of choice and put it at the end of your transmission. This works with: laughs, giggles, chortles, snickers, cries, sobs, mumbles, coughs, snorts, groans, yawns, sighs, and chuckles. Example: *laughs*

Examples:
  TR CHAT *laughs*  (This becomes: [Chatter] Albori laughs.)
  TR CHAT I dropped my taco! *cries* (This becomes: [Chatter] Albori transmits through tears, "I dropped my taco!")

  Starship Relay Channel
Some starships possess a relay channel upgrade which allows them to relay communicator signals among a select group of individuals. The following commands apply to ship relay channels:

  CHANNEL - In the starship control room, this allows the ship owner to enable/disable the relay, authorize a communicator, or deauthorize a communicator.
  TR SHIP [message] - Transmits [message] to the ship relay channel if you're authorized.
  TR SHIP UNLINK - Unlinks your communicator from the ship relay channel.


This covers communicators! If you have any further questions, you are more than welcome to type ASSIST to request personal assistance from a staff member.

It's easy for you to say this though when I am not the one who created the distance between us and you are untouchable. I appreciate it that I would be attractive to you if we were in the same space. Otherwise Tibo, yes I still love you and I'll wait for you but I make no guarantees at this point. There is no other man nor do I have plans to look for one either. I'm just telling you how it is."

My dearest Love,
Well it has likewise come the time for me to tell you that if you were telling me the truth all along, then you wouldn't truly be a coward that you are being and leave piloting. Yes you cheated with a cheater so you got what you truly deserved now. I hope I never find your mistress alone as now I will truly get revenge for destroying as she obviously has or you would come back to me. She has brainwashed you so horribly as well. You wer cheating on me before that night that you faked a breakup with me to try to cover yourself. You obviously had contact with her and a plan to move in. That is cheating as who knows how long and then you moved in with her in some other man's home. That is so disgusting and so disrespectful of the spirit and to the owner of the property especially if it is a boyfriend or former boyfriend.
So either come back to me and face me or be on your way Tibo Beauchene or the memory I will have of you will be only of a cheater who wouldn't admit to his wrongs, a coward who wouldn't hold himself accountable for his stupid mistakes in judgement and obviously one who couldn't encourage a decent woman like me to trust him and consumate her love with you. At least i was correct in that you would prove yourself untrustworthy.
I did offer to forgive you and to make an effort to be with you one on one to work out our differences. Cowards only run and hide behind their broken promises and lies though rather than face those whom they have hurt.
I always felt that you were hiding something and I know now that you are just a user whom i obviously couldn't resist so that is my fault for allowing it. If you weren't, you would be back in my arms. I suppose there is some remote glint of guilt on your behalf there because you are so compeled to run away and throw your career away rather than admit to your wrongs and apologize to me.
You lashed out at me for your problems too which means you still can't see through your own lack of accountability. I am the one you can trust though but it's so painful that you would blame me rather than admit it that you yourself are responsible for your failures.
it's sad for you Tibo Beauchene and my heart will miss you forever but we pilots certainly don't need another dishonest cheater amongst us women who only desire a good and honest companion. I wanted to marry you and I still do but my intuition told me I should wait and I am so right that you haven't the decency to face me.
I will say to you one last time, that the door is still open and especially for you to come back to me and prove that I am wrong. One other thing Tibo though is you are to show me that you are truly a man of integrity. You will also cease blaming me for what others do to you as well. You know Tibo,you just don't realize who your friends truly are as well and especially that I am not a cheater like Miriam Val
20:10 leris who cheted on her boyfriend to break us up. If you come back to me, I will leave her to her miserable life sleeping around with any man she wants though. She truly has the blackest heart and soul as she has no comprehension of guilt for the destruction in her path.
I will be sad forever Tibo and I may never get over it if you don't come back and at least try to work things out with me. Still, if you won't, I can't blame myself for your turning your back on me and running away to cover your wrongs.
I still love you with my heart because true love never dies.
Kitty
