Howdy, folks!
Do you like xenofish? Snappers? Maxwells? Grabbers? Do you like the idea of
trying to preserve the habitat in which they were originally found by humans?
Then this trip might be for you!
At the turn of the Old Earth New Year, I will be departing with a crew to head
to that place known as the space aquarium. This will be a preservation trip. We
will not be taking anything from the aquarium (including but not limited to
eggs, shells, coral, and the like), but rather attempting to replenish and do
anything we can to try to save it.
If this sounds like something you would like to do, please let me know. We will
be taking a galleon graciously offered as our luxurious transportation by
Melinda Michaels. As of right now, I have room for 6 additional crew. Please
write me a letter to let me know your intent. If you were on the original crew
list, you are still on the list and have received a letter from me.
Many thankings!

I placed at least a dozen Light Purple (Eels) in a few rooms when we were there

those eggs are still just floating around there. Have fun and we'll pass on this

Lily, I will be photographing when we are there and can share the photo album
with you when we return. I am planning on taking some of the rarer eggs as I can
get my hands on them. That being said, I will re-post (in a way) what I did on
the trading board some time ago. If you have eggs that you would like to sell or
even donate, please let me know. I probably have enough Maxwell eggs and enough
of the light blues and light greens. Off the top of my head, I don't recall if I
have many eels (light purples) or not. If you would like to sell or donate eggs,
please get in touch with me sooner rather than later.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, and a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
