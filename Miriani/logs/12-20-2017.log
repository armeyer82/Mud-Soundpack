00:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:19 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:19 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

06:09 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door opens.

06:09 (Docking Bay) A number of drones swarm into the docking bay and begin securing several lines to the one-person expediter "Dolphin". A number of the drones begin floating in the air, each carrying a line until the ship is gently hovering in the air. The drones then begin slowly hauling the ship out of the docking bay, carefully being guided by spaceport workers.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

15:40 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:40 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:40 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:40 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

15:40 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:41 You peer west and see...

15:41 ["Incendie" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret here.
You see Miriam Valleris here.
You can go east and west.

15:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:41 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

15:41 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

15:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Incendie. We read your Commonwealth transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

15:41 Miriam Valleris says, "all righty, getting mission" into a small microphone mounted on the wall.

15:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a large amber baby silver statue of an ornately carved pyramid, and an internal stun turret here.
You see Miriam Valleris and Cria Blur here.
You can go south and out.

16:17 Miriam Valleris sashays south.

16:17 Cria Blur leaves the area behind Miriam Valleris.

16:17 The ten-person battlecruiser "Carnival of Carnage" has jumped into the sector.

16:17 Miriam Valleris sashays in from the south.

16:18 The ten-person battlecruiser "Carnival of Carnage" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

16:18 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:18 Miriam Valleris inputs a command into a small navigation console.

16:18 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:18 ["Demonic Demonstration" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

You can go south and out.

16:18 Miriam Valleris peruses a small security display.

16:18 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:18 The ten-person battlecruiser "Carnival of Carnage" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

16:18 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:18 Miriam Valleris inputs some coordinates into a navigational control console.

16:18 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The ten-person battlecruiser "Pandia" has launched from Rolukssica.

16:18 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.

16:18 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:18 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:18 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:18 Miriam Valleris's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "when will that kitty party start?"

16:18 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:18 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:38 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the three-person antagonizer "Phosphorous And The Thud", the three-person heliogaster "Aqueous Transmission", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", and the one-person expediter "Dolphin" landed here.
You see Dee the droid, Tausha the droid, Yowl the droid, Boomer the droid, Scrappy the droid, Karalyn the droid, Calyssa the droid, Cletus the droid, Sameer the droid, Jessicapops the droid, Delta the droid, Chander the droid, and Dixy the droid here.

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

18:39 The ship is already moving.

18:39 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:39 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Apartment 26860; Foyer.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood e
19:33 nd table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Jenaia the droid here.
You see Miriam Valleris (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

19:42 Miriam Valleris
She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This 25 year old woman stands 5 feet and 10 inches tall and is lithe with a large bust size. She has a dark complexion. Her waist-length, midnight black hair is pulled back in an elegant French twist and tied back with white silk ribbons and dotted with shimmering blue sapphires and diamonds. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth. Her abdomen is somewhat heavily rounded and swollen. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.
She has a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her left earlobe and a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat and the nails on her right hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat.
For a top, she is wearing a long black satin shawl with a red teardrop shaped clasp over a conservative black cashmere long sleeve blouse with a lace-trimmed collar and three ruby red pearl buttons down the front and a black silk front clasp bra with a black diamond rose-shaped clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets over a black g-string with tiny metallic studs. She is wearing a pair of sexy black leather combat boots over a pair of ribbed black anklet socks on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an ar
19:42 chaeological artifact storage container, a level one archaeological dig site scanner, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a black spacesuit navigational computer, a black spacesuit jet, and a white fuzzy artifact storage container.
She is carrying nothing.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", the ten-person battlecruiser "Solidus", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", the six-person destroyer "Off With Their Heads", the one-person expediter "Stop Watch", the ten-person battlecruiser "Vis Vindico", the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 3937", the one-person cargo hauler "Boscodog", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Temporal Incursion" landed here.

Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security

For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

20:12 You're already sitting down.

20:12 You pull a series of straps around Miriam Valleris and securely buckle her into her seat.

20:12 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:12 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:12 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:12 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:12 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:12 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:12 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:12 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

20:12 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:12 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:12 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:12 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

20:12 The ship is already moving.

20:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

20:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:12 You say, "I have mail."

20:12 You squeeze Miriam Valleris affectionately.

20:12 #$#soundpack social | squeeze | male

20:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:12 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Apartment 26860; Foyer.

20:12 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:12 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

22:52 Miriam Valleris pushes a small lever away from herself, activating the ship's systems.

22:52 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:52 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request launch clearance.
The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:52 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

22:52 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
