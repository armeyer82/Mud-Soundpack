00:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

00:50 The computer reports the six-person destroyer "Warrior Princess" is one unit away from this ship.

00:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

00:50 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:50 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very 
03:39 particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it like any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

Houses
--------------------------------------------------
HOUSES:

Q: What do I need to get a house?
A: Houses are 5000 points and two billion credits up front plus an additional fee (10 million) for each room you add.

Q: Where can a house be located?
A: A house can be located on any planet, moon, or spacestation other than: Acrylon, Angelus, Outreach, Miriani, Pax, Empanda, Aquili, Freistadt, Charon, Venus, Mercury, Pluto, Luna, Earth, Caranza, any of the stations in sector 19, any planet or moon in sector 12, the Jump Hub Station in sector 0, and any player-owned space station or planet unless you have the permission of the station or planet owner. These are subject to change and other places may be added at any time.

Q: What can a house have?!
A: A house will come with a way to boot anyone out of the house, a biometric entrance where you can set the people you want able to come in, an optional pool, an optional hot tub, an optional private garage, and the ability to create the design of the house exactly as you'd like it and describe all the rooms yourself.

Q: How do I get a house?
A: Visit the realtor's office on Aquatimis in sector 10. From the office itself, type REQUEST. Your name will be placed in a queue and somebody will meet with you when time permits to create your house. When requesting your realtor, make sure you have information ready, such as what planet you would like your house on, where on
03:58  the planet you want it, and what you would like it called.

Q: I don't want my house to be at this location anymore. How can I get it moved?
A: For a fee of 1,000,000,000 credits, you can assist and have your house relocated. This fee is non-negociable. Think of it as having to break up your house into segments and send it by truck across country. Moving houses is a very tedious process, so in order to curb the constant requests to relocate, we had to impose a fee.

*** It is worth noting that if your house is built on a private structure, such as a space station, moon or planet that does not belong to you and the owner of the property denies you access, it is entirely an in character issue. Furthermore, if the property's owner is no longer in the game and another party purchases the property, it is not the responsibility or obligation of the hosts to move your house for you free of charge.

Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:

Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.

Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.

Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, planet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.

Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.

Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.

Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in secto
04:39 r 33 for sectors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

05:35 Kitty Mars says, "well as i say hugs and typical affection is fine. it's how you continue the relationsip. I would be more than happy for you and Cally to hug"

05:37 You say, "I'm not even very social at all. I show up for missions, I stay in my weapon room, I don't understand why you're jealous over me saying two simple words. It's not like I even said an endearment."

05:37 Kitty Mars says, "how you continue the relationship. I think you know perfectly well and acting like a martyr isn't going to help anything. I have no problem with your hugging Cally, Aalyiah or even Amre if she doesn't go from one man to the next in the org. It is how you treat that relationship and I am certainly aware that you are a very bright man and understand exactly what I am referring to."

--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  who [aie | commonwealth | hale | organization | newbies | unidle | courier | out of comms | out of local | -ools | <person>]
  @who-record

Description:
  Displays a listing of connected players. If used with no arguments, it will display a player's name, alliance, and out of local/out of comms status. An asterisk (*) indicates that a player is out of communications range, meaning they cannot be contacted at all. A caret (^) indicates that the player is out of local space, meaning they are available for communication but they are physically too far away to interact much with.

  The @who-record command allows you to view the record number of players connected at the same time.

  The @WHO-STATS command displays a graph detailing connection metrics for the last 24 hours. Adding the 'small' argument will split the size of the graph in half. Using the 'text' argument (can be shortened to 't') will display a textual representation of recent player connection statistics.

Optional Arguments:
  AIE - Displays connected members of the Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists.
  Commonwealth - Displays connected members of the Commonwealth of Free Spirits.
  Hale - Displays connected members of the Hale Collective.
  Organization - Displays connected members of your private organization, if you happen to be a member of one. This can be abbreviated to 'or
06:06 g'.
  Courier - Typing who courier will tell you what members are awake in your courier company.
  Newbies - Displays connected newbies.
  Unidle - Displays how many of the total connected players have been active within the past 30 minutes.
  Out of Comms - Displays only connected players who are out of communications range. This can be abbreviated to 'ooc'.
  Out of local - Displays only connected players who are out of local space. This can be abbreviated to 'ool'.
  -ools - Displays only connected players who are in local space. (Note the dash before ools.)
  <person> - Typing a player name after who will indicate to you whether or not that player is awake as well as what their gender is

13:03 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:03 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

13:03 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:03 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:03 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
I don't understand that.

13:03 You need to stand up first.

13:03 You must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

13:03 I don't understand that ("chair" is an ambiguous name).

13:03 You need to stand up first.

13:03 You must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

13:03 You stand up.

13:03 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

13:03 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

13:03 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:03 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:03 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:03 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:03 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:03 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

13:03 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:04 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:04 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:04 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

13:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

13:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:04 You can't go that way.

13:04 You should stand up first.

13:04 You can't go that way.

13:04 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay] (indoors)
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame and an ethereal oil painting of a blue underwater scene dotted with colorful fish hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

13:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

13:24 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

13:24 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

13:24 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:24 You remove a droid remote titled "Kalista" from a black leather briefcase.

13:24 You gently slide a droid remote titled "Kalista" into a slot on the side of a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. With a soft click, the remote snaps into place and the screen is filled with a live broadcast of Atrium.

13:24 You start watching a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

13:24 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

13:24 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

13:24 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

13:24 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."
> (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has undocked from Pinnacle.

13:24 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:24 The ship is already moving.

13:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:24 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:24 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:24 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

13:24 The starship must be in space.

13:24 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:24 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:24 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:24 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

13:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:25 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:25 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:25 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

13:25 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:25 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

I think it might be a neat inovation if we could place an FTL beacon in an uncharted sector--such as a remote outpost--and be able to jump to that sector, as long as we are in range of it. The trick is, they would have to be specially bought from players who construct them from mined materials on asteroids, and components available in Alliance space, such as electronics. I admit this is just an outline, but what do people think?

Agreed--so it'd basically be a private network, kind of like the starship comm relays. As to price, I was thinking 100000000 mill.

19:10 ["Dolphin" Airlock] (indoors)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a black leather recliner, an internal stun turret, and a large pottery wheel here.
You can go enter and out.

19:10 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

19:10 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

19:11 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:11 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

19:11 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

19:11 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

19:11 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:11 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

19:11 Enter a destination:

19:11 The ship is already moving.

19:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:11 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:11 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:11 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and four space stations have been detected in the sector."

19:11 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:11 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.
A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:11 The computer announces, "A planet and a space station have been detected in the sector."

19:11 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:11 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 4, 2."

19:11 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:11 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Saving Myself" has jumped into the sector.

19:11 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:11 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:11 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

19:11 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

19:11 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Saving Myself" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

19:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

19:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:12 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Saving Myself" has docked with Pinnacle.

19:12 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

19:12 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

19:12 You must stand up first.

19:16 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:16 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

19:16 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

19:16 You're already sitting down.

19:16 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

19:16 I don't understand that.

19:16 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

19:16 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

19:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

19:17 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:17 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I also would like to earn enough to buy a dart and my BC once I qualify for it."

19:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

19:18 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Well we may have to go out again and we can because once we have enough for you to get your receiver, then I know you'd like to be able to use it."

19:18 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "For sure."

19:19 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "So let's focus this time on going out to find your receiver parts and see where we are at that point because remember coming back doubles the area we can hunt so it's all good."

19:59 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

20:26 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

20:26 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:26 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

20:26 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:26 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:26 [Force] Kenny Marley transmits, "I wouldn't call them traders."

20:26 [Force] Kitty Mars transmits, "Yeah and Insanity tried to recruit me and I thumbed my nose at them particularly when they stole my Dart and my fighter."

20:26 You're already buckled in.

20:26 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:27 [Force] Aaliyah Morales transmits, "Who was in insanity?"

20:27 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:27 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:27 You're already buckled in.

20:27 [Force] Kitty Mars transmits, "Cria and Fawkes and the blurr bitches and others."

20:27 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:32 I don't understand that.

20:32 The internal environment does not match that of the airlock.

20:32 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

20:32 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Beginning cycling."

20:32 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard entering the airlock.

20:33 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

20:33 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Cycling complete."

20:33 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "Not presently, although if you had a Vanguard or Cruiser, once I'm done with this roid, I'd be happy to go."

20:33 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

20:33 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

20:36 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

20:36 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Or we could do mods if we get enough people."

20:37 [General Communication] Tom Tucker transmits, "A vanguard can do mods. It's actually exciting."

20:37 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "That is also true... Or we could attempt Cruiser or Vanguard mods, if you feel up for the challenge?"

20:38 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Well, I don't have a vanguard, so it'd have to be a cruiser or destroyer mods."

20:39 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "Cruiser sounds good... And either an easy or mod is fine with me... I wish you could attach a couple of fighters to a cruiser and do BZZRs with it. Now that would be fun!"

20:39 [General Communication] Kenny Marley transmits, "Negative."

20:39 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "I heard about an enterprising freighter captain who apparently did a BZZR."

20:40 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Ugh, no idea if I can fly a cruiser mod."

20:40 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:40 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

20:40 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:40 [General Communication] Tom Tucker transmits, "All you need is a carrier or something else with a docking bay. I don't know if a freighter would work actually. It's only got two lasers, so bzzrs might attack it. But bring the fighters along in the main ship."

20:40 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:40 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Ok mods."

20:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:40 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "I'll run."

20:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:40 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

20:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:40 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "yup you can I've gunned for them and i may have flown very precariously through one a long time ago"

20:40 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

20:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:40 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

20:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:40 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "Awesome! Eng, unless someone really needs it."

20:41 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Oh, I was going to run mods if we could get enough, but go for it. I'll join."

20:41 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Ok... I need 4 gunners then."

20:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Rolukssica.

20:41 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:41 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Oh sorry tibo go for it."

20:41 [General Communication] Alexander Martellato transmits, "Darn."

20:41 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "I will not be a crew stealer, at least not today."

20:41 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "What about tomorrow?"

20:41 [General Communication] Tom Tucker snickers.

20:42 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "I am in."

20:42 [General Communication] Alexander Martellato transmits, "If I can eng I am."

20:42 [General Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "Just hauling a roid."

20:42 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

20:42 [1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:42 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

20:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:42 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Ok, so 3 spots mods."

20:42 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Erm, 3 spots mods."

20:43 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "I can't talk. Hopefully, I can fly better than I can talk."

20:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

20:43 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway giggles.

20:43 I don't understand that.

20:44 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Erm sure."

20:53 You peer out and see...

20:53 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the five-person transverser "Oblivion Edge", the ten-person battlecruiser "Solidus", and the six-person destroyer "Samma" landed here.
You see Dee the droid, Tausha the droid, Yowl the droid, Boomer the droid, Scrappy the droid, Karalyn the droid, Calyssa the droid, Cletus the droid, Sameer the droid, Jessicapops the droid, Delta the droid, Chander the droid, and Dixy the droid here.

20:54 You indicate to your group members that you no longer wish for them to follow you.

20:54 Allen Robinson asks, "So, where would you like me?"

20:54 Allen Robinson examines a display containing the starship's status report.

20:54 You ask, "Gunning then?"

20:54 Allen Robinson says, "Sure."

20:54 You say, "Go ahead and gun."

20:54 Allen Robinson walks up.

20:55 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:55 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:55 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

20:55 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:55 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:55 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

20:55 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:55 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

20:55 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:55 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

20:56 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

20:56 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:56 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:56 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

20:56 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

20:56 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:56 You press a large yellow button.

21:19 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.

21:20 ["Critical Strike" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You can go south and out.

21:22 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:22 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

21:22 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:23 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:23 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:42 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:42 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:42 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "but i'll slow down so you don't hurt your back trying to out gun me, old man"

21:42 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:43 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

21:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:43 Kitty Mars's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I'm lucky if i can get 29 these days"

The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:57 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "roborant mods are nothing compared to roborant difs"

21:57 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:57 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:57 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:57 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Oh gosh, don't remind me about robo diffs."

21:57 Jaydee Rivers's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Granted."

21:57 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:57 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

21:57 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:57 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:57 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

21:57 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "but fun, if a little protracted"

21:58 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "My cannons only have 2 shots left, oh no."

22:20 ["Critical Strike" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
