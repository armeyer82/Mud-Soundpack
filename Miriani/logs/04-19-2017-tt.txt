[Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Repairing
Nuclear Broadcast Facility; Docking Bay.
You see a long plasteel counter, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a hand-made purple
and amethyst flower quilt, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, and a large periwinkle bed
pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, and a torchiere with a stained glass shade depicting three pink and green
dragonflies with finely crafted filigree wings on a golden background (casting a
white-colored glow) here.

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Repairing Nuclear Broadcast

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Repairing
Nuclear Broadcast Facility; Docking Bay.
You see a long plasteel counter, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets,
and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table
with a glass top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy
seashell pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a pair of mystic purple suede clogs, a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a tight black t-shirt
with a bright purple dragon embroidered on the front, a pair of skinny faded
blue low rise jeans, a satiny periwinkle demi bra, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt here.
