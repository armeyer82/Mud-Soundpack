  * Alliances that are on hostile terms with any other alliances (either full war or declaration of hostility) will now have their capital planet's long-range laser disabled. This means that capital sectors can be interdicted, blockaded, or otherwise disrupted if any sort of hostility is in effect.
  * Fixed a bug that would allow players to propose a treaty for a military alliance, even if there were no active hostilities between the three alliances.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

23:06 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light

23:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

23:06 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:06 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

23:06 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person sentinel "Situation Critical" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

23:06 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:06 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

23:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has undocked from Empanda Station.

23:07 The ship is already moving.

23:07 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:07 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:07 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

23:07 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

23:07 The ship must be in space to do that.

23:07 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:07 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

23:07 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:07 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:07 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:07 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:07 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

23:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:07 You make a selection on a compact gold Lore computer.

23:07 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kalista" reports current location pinpointed aboard the five-person transverser "Remnants" at Hyperion.

23:08 You peer out and see...

23:08 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the six-person sentinel "Defiance", the ten-person battlecruiser "Impact", the six-person destroyer "Better Sorry Than Safe", the six-person sentinel "Nightingale", the eight-person gunship "Red Messenger", the ten-person battlecruiser "Genocide", the one-person expediter "The Nexus", and the five-person transverser "Ikezuki" landed here.
