02:36:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And it was great, and using your tips I really crushed it."

02:36:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, wow!"

02:36:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So basically what I'm saying is that you're full of wisdom."

02:37:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I am glad I could help you out."

02:37:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Me too!"

02:40:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like lots of people will be gone."

02:41:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, like usually with those expeditions."

02:42:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been meaning to hit you with a note about my availability for the meeting."

02:42:52 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Could I get some help on a high solo beacon?"

02:43:03 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Coming."

02:43:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, that is obviously not happening with Ather and Vernos on that trip."

02:43:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Are you also going?"

02:43:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, oh that's right there was going to be a meeting."

02:43:47 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Thank you."

02:43:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I'll be around."

02:44:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, we will have to postpone until after this trip, unfortunately."

02:44:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm glad there will be some good pilots still here to hold down the fort."

02:44:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather gave me solo beacon homework."

02:44:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe if I do enough of that I'll be a good pilot."

02:44:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

02:44:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, did he indeed?"

02:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And, are you on that expedition, Eli?"

02:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, he was showing me some stuff yesterday."

02:46:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I am going yes, I'm prety excited."

02:47:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This kind of thing is the whoel reason I became a pilot, but this will be my first time on a large expidition. Figured it would be good experience for when I do my own in a couple of months."

02:47:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I doubt there is more room on Nissi's ship for me."

02:47:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've never had an opportunity to go this far into the unknown before."

02:47:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, you will learn a lot on that trip."

02:48:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And you wil love the imperator!"

02:48:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've been out on my own plenty of times, or with a couple of people, and I've been on trips out to deep space trading posts and such, but never never into the unknown like this."

02:49:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah I'm hearing some very intriguiing things about that ship Kim."

02:50:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I can try and find out if there's more room, I only just now found out that so many were going."

02:51:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Do you know when it leaves? Is it tonight at 00:00?"

02:52:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, it's big enough for 18 crew members. It has a galley and an observation lounge. That is also true for the science vessel. The imperator also has this charting mainframe thing, in which you can store information on locations you visit and find them back easier for a few weeks. And then.... the reality bubble."

02:52:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, mostly I've heard about the reality bubble."

02:53:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think it might leave tonight, but not sure really."

03:01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."

03:01:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'm about to head back in."

03:02:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do I return from 285 again?"

03:02:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do I travel to 286?"

03:02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, 286."

03:06:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow. They'll be gone a long time."

03:07:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, they are."

03:08:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hey Constantine, I have a question for you."

03:08:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure!"

03:08:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I have one for you, after."

03:09:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, your questions are always more important than mine. I was just curious, whether you have been considering any org."

03:09:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I haven't really looked into it much."

03:09:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My understanding is that I'm too green still."

03:10:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Shule told me to let him know when I had been around for a month."

03:10:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You won't be too green for much longer."

03:10:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true, I've been three weeks in the corps yesterday."

03:10:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah they definitely would like you to join Space explorers then."

03:10:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that the org you're in?"

03:11:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, that is Lily and Shule's. I am the founder of Starseekers."

03:11:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."

03:11:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you guys get up to?"

03:12:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are the orgs mostly about sharing resources?"

03:12:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And planning expeditions and such?"

03:14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, it is safe to say you of course would be welcome in Starseekers. But, the choice needs to be yours, not someone else's. So, ask questions, ask yourself, what kind of org do I want to be a part of. Do I even want in an org, and then make the choice that you think fits with you. Resource sharing is definitely a big part of it, so is making ships available for rent. I really don't want that to be all we do, and hope we can organize a party or something, maybe go to NQ one day, or Sage's redoubt and Rogers. And yes, sometimes orgs also organize expeditions, or that salvage op thing we did out of comms range a few weeks ago, that you may have heard of."

03:15:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I didn't hear about that."

03:16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Orgs also have a lot to do with the plants that enhance starships, you may have heard about them too. We grow them and sell them, each org has their own. Some orgs give benifits to their members on the plants, some may not."

03:16:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have heard of plants."

03:17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I didn't realize we had different orgs within the AEU."

03:17:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll definitely talk to you sometime about what Starseekers do."

03:17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, we went to this oort cloud 80 lightyears south of Campeche where we set up a bunch of temp stations and did salvage ops, hauled roids, and had a lot of fun. Business cats was the main organizer, but all orgs helped out."

03:18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that sounds cool."

03:18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like we don't get up to salvage ops a lot."

03:18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The AEU, that is."

03:18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, and for a little while, I am sure we won't get the interests at all, 25 salvage ops in less than a week is a lot, people are burned out. But safe to say we rocked those goals."

03:19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

03:19:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, there are 3 active orgs in the AEU at the moment. Ather runs space invaders. Whether he accepts members I don't know. I run Starseekers with the help of Evangeline and Morris. And Lily and Shule have Space explorers amidst the stars. There are more, but they are not active."

03:20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, ok."

03:20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I guess the orgs can span across alliances, then."

03:20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I think Morris is a Starseeker?"

03:21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you just said that."

03:21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

03:21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry, the hauling run kept me out way later than I expected."

03:21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, orgs can choose to let members of different alliances in. Starseekers is an AEU org, but I broke unity, that is, let members from other alliances join in. We lost a lot of org points, are rebuilding, but it's been worth it very much."

03:21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting."

03:21:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that is an interesting dynamic."

03:22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Do you know where the org centre is in the space port on New Earth?"

03:22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Especially with the way AEU politics are going in general."

03:22:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I admire that you guys do that."

03:22:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, by the license point center, right? I think I've passed by it."

03:22:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not support the isolationist movement at all."

03:23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Me neither."

03:23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually it's what brought me here."

03:23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, there is one, and also on the upper floor of the liaison office building. You can find information on all public orgs there."

03:23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had always though I'd be a career academic."

03:24:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But even the institutions on New Earth are turning all their funding inward."

03:24:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I know. Worrying."

03:24:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's cool, I'll definitely check that out."

03:25:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And probably talk to you about it more this week."

03:25:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Speaking of which, I had two things to run by you."

03:25:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:25:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That sounds cool. Ask questions, and decide where you would feel at home."

03:25:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then I gotta get some much needed rack time."

03:25:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "First, I know Ather will be gone on the expedition, and I believe Shule and Lily will also."

03:26:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather dutifully checks our sectors every day for threats. I thought maybe you could take me on a run once, and then maybe I could do it a couple times."

03:26:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So far, I know Ather, Vernos and Eli are, not sure on Shule and Lily."

03:26:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I should probably grab a felo though, in case I see anything nasty."

03:26:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "He does it through his terminal, but sure, I can show you how its down."

03:27:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought he was actually flying around."

03:27:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

03:27:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, more than 1 felo."

03:27:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's less involved than I thought then."

03:27:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, he is not gonna be there to do it through his terminal. So, we will have to do it manually."

03:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, ok."

03:27:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Perfect."

03:28:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if you could use the help, I'd be happy to do it any day."

03:28:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I will sure teach you."

03:28:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then, I was in Landfall earlier."

03:28:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't been since I was a kid."

03:28:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Nice town, isn't it?"

03:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The Intrepid is so impressive."

03:29:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and actually I noticed there's an apartment building there."

03:29:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I was thinking it could be cool, though admittedly the travel time is sort of inconvenient."

03:29:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it seemed like no units were available."

03:29:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Sure thing. And, I have seen that. We can't rent there though, not sure why."

03:29:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, ok. I figured as much, I just wanted to ask."

03:30:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I don't know whether we have ever been able to rent there, certainly not since I joined the corps."

03:31:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The place in New Phoenix seems expensive for being underground."

03:31:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, the apartments are not more expensive than at the calm which is a space station, but to get started, the deposit... yeah."

03:32:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought rent at the calm was cheaper."

03:32:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uhm, I didn't think so."

03:33:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have never rented there, only looked."

03:33:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, maybe the underground place isn't so bad then."

03:33:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have an apartment there, but... I don't really go there often enough, might just give it up."

03:34:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I can't really decide if it's worth it."

03:34:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I sleep in my aereal fortress right now."

03:34:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is at least spacious."

03:35:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is not a bad place to sleep. I also sleep in a ship most of the time these days."

03:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oof, speaking of."

03:35:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I better hit the rack."

03:35:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll look into the orgs."

03:36:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And talk to you a bunch this week, I'm sure."

03:36:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Right, anything else you wanted to ask, or was that all?"

03:36:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I think I'm good for now."

03:36:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks!"

03:36:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And have a good one."

03:36:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You too, sleep well."

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

23:38:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a purple jeweled leash here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

23:38:52 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

23:38:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

23:38:57 You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, I would like to take a moment to welcome Tolorek Solo, Neil Graham, Jessica Hills and Karl Brjolnif to the pilot corps. I hope you will all have a fruitful time where you reach your goals and learn something along the way. That concludes my report, fly safe everyone! Kim Saunders. [08:34  2 June 2317 GST]
2,516,438.41 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00  3 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots: as of this comm notice, all AEU sectors appear to be clear of all threats, Bari and otherwise. However, remember to keep your ships powered down and garaged wherever possible. I also encourage you all to read Aisling's post on general/general, and to avoid targeting Allied pirate starships in any Mutuality sector. If you're unsure whether a sector belongs to them, check your starmap. That's one of the things it's for. Lastly, I will be leaving on a bit of a jaunt on Monday. To those who I have promised to give lessons to, you will be receiving letters from me tonight scheduling at least one lesson before departure time. I hope you can make it! In the meantime, if anyone has any questions before I leave, you have until Monday to either mail me, or to call the SDC office. [03:31  3 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots: as of this comm notice, AEU space continues to be clear of all threats, including Bari infestations and the like. This is also another reminder that starting Monday night I will not be available for some time, as I will be going out on a trip. If you want anything from me, if you have questions, comments or concerns, you have a little under 48 hours to get in contact with me. Send letters, call the SDC office, try to find me on comms. Otherwise, fly safe, defend AEU space and don't do anything dumb! [03:43  4 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Industrial Whip: We are currently at 47% toward our first goal, and 28% toward the second currently. I will be gone on a trip wth others on Monday so later today will be my last update for a bit. See you all soon! [05:38  4 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello all, First, I would like to welcome Mark William to the pilot corps. Secondly, it looks like we will have to postpone the meeting I was planning, as at least 3 AEU pilots are going on an expedition lead by Nissi, starting tonight and probably won't be back for 2 to 3 weeks. Once the expedition returns, I will again attempt to schedule this meeting. Have a nice day and fly safe! [10:06  4 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Industrial Whip: Current goal update! We are currently at 60% toward the first goal and 35% toward the second, Our biggest activity is starship combat with over 63% of contribution. With two days left in the current period, the current top three contributors are Constantin
