A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the four-person roborant "Chain of Memories", the four-person roborant "Jazz Funeral", the eight-person gunship "Blue Star", and the eight-person gunship "Unnatural Disaster" landed here.

You can go south and out.

04:46 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Yeah, I know, but until I can get my house bilt. That's the only place I can live that has a private garage."

04:46 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

04:46 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

04:46 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

04:46 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

04:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

04:46 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

04:46 You sit down on a dark blue suede sofa.

04:46 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

04:46 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

04:46 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

04:46 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

04:47 #$#soundpack_pong

04:47 #$#soundpack_lag 104

04:47 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

04:47 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

04:47 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

04:47 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

04:47 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Well this is why I liked it for the lower 40 sectors."

04:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

04:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

04:47 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

04:47 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

04:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

04:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:47 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:47 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Tibo,
you have to understand that I am a rather private person. What you said in that mis-com was a bit insightful in that you were saying something to cause Amore to be judgemental by saying 'kitty is refusing thus far'. You only brought up being friends this evening and I never refused that so that's not being fair don't you think? I jus feel that if friends are there to help us both then they should be mutual friends and I don't consider Amore to be a mutual friend as she has not done anything but communicate with just you. Therefore, she is only hearing just your side of the issues. So all you had to say when I asked the first time that you request that amore stay out of our affairs, then you could have come back and said that she was encouraging you to work with me. Then I would certainly be more trusting of her motives. In truth, we do have to be best friends too if we're going to grow into another phase. Friends trust one another and friends have your back. Lovers don't always have those qualities. If all that I can have with you is friendship, then I am willing to be that even though I won't stop loving you. I will just have to keep my feelings to myself. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy sex though as you don't have to love me to have sex with me. I enjoy it with you so I'm willing to accept your sudden change of heart.
As for traveling out to get our ships, I will be very grateful to have your assistance. Also, I 
15:12 am still willing to do additional traveling to help you earn more artifacting points and your Radio Receiver components. I have traveled before with friends and I do enjoy working with you in this respect.
Your friend,

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.

15:44 A letter

Kitty,
You're right. I could have and probably should have said something like that. Truth is, Amore has not really taken sides. All she has done is to ask questions to help me really think about any decision I make. She doesn't want to see me or anyone else get hurt. She has no interest in me whatsoever and has a boyfriend who you like and respect. However, his name is a secret that she and her boyfriend have requested to make public when they are ready. I'm not sure why and it's really none of my business.
As I said previously, I am more than happy to go with you to retrieve your ship. It was my fault it got stranded out there in the first place so it's only right that I accompany you to rescue it.
As to our friendship, I don't think it'd be right for us to have sex as just friends nor do I think you'd particularly be comfortable with it. I of course could be wrong, but I was under the impression that you preferred to be intimate with only boyfriends or similar type of arrangement. Plus, I stated last night that I didn't want to get involved with anyone for a while and that would be going back on my word. Furthermore, I would think that you'd think less of me if I was willing to just have sex with people who are just friends. 
What then differentiates boyfriends and such from just friends with benefits? I mean, is that what you are offering? Maybe there's just something I don't know. I'm still so new when it comes to
15:44  this kind of thing. How would we deal with jealousy? As friends, I have no right to impose boundaries regarding your affections with others. 
I still care about you deeply and still admire you and will always remain doing so. If I could promise to be faithful to just you, I'd get back together with you in a heartbeat. My indiscretions have already hurt people and I am displeased with myself. Take care.
Your Friend,
Tibo

20:22 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors
["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.
20:22 

20:22 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:22 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

20:22 You can't launch from here.

20:23 #$#soundpack_pong

20:23 #$#soundpack_lag 137

20:23 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

20:23 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

20:23 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

20:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:23 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:23 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:23 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:23 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

20:23 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:23 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:23 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:23 The computer announces, "Two starships and two planets have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:23 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

20:23 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:23 Select a ship:

20:23 [1] the one-person space sleigh "Santa Claus is Coming to Space"
[2] the six-person destroyer "Hexanity"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

20:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:23 Invalid selection.

20:23 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:23 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:23 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

20:23 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

20:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:23 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:23 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

22:17 A piece of purple stationery with a seashell border

my dearest Love,
First, I'm quite surprised that you were upset with my being in your ship. Since i am the one who left, I find it perplexing that you took offense. i honestly thought that you would be pleased to find that i had returned. I thought you would be happy to see me and that we could at least discuss things. I also felt that it was the time the other night when I left that i felt that I was so ready to consumate my love with you. I had been thinking often lately of how i wanted to make love with you and how I'd just so much wish that we had the opportunity to just hangout for a couple of days and cuddle and make awesome love. I know that for me, i've always wanted that to be a special time, a special moment in our lives when I could express how I truly feel about you. I didn't want it to be just a casual experience as for me love-making isn't merely a physical act. For me, making love is the deepest possible emotional experience one can ever have. I expressed how heart-broken I was and I meant it because here I was finally ready. Then you turned your back on me.
I know Love it's not been an easy time for you to wait for me to be ready to be more physical. It's just that I wanted to be certain that you truly felt the same way and that when we did take that special journey into the depths of our love, that it would be the beginning of something which was everlasting.
I am so sorry for making the statements I did. I deeply am but don't you understand that what you did was deliberately hurtful? What had I done which was so wrong for you to seem as though you went out on a cheap and hurtful act to be cruel to me. How would you have felt if after hearing you express how hurt you were and sad, and then you discovered I was in a house which belongs to nobody which has a name that sounds like some sort of a house of ill repute or a place where pilots go to exploit sex? Yes, I looked up the property and it is to be auctioned. Obviously, whomever you are having your sexual escapades with doesn't have the decency to take you to her own place but must poach in a property which isn't hers. She was obviously added to the garage and Biometric lock so how sneaky. how can you trus that sort of judgement over mine? Oh too, how in two days can you say that you love someone else? Again, I don't feel remorseful for calling this person cheap and one I would not readily consider to have true feelings. There are women pilots around and yes I can name several, who will talk the talk and make you feel all warm and loved when they're just as much into the experience as you are for it's physical value. Love does not evolve overnight and you should know this. All I can ask of you my Darling is that you would please stop to consider that your actions were themselves hurtful. you didn't even seem to want to talk with me but gave me the cold shoulder for a wrong which I did not commit. I was so looking forward to being with you then and yes, as i said, I truly thought that you would see it that I wanted to show you forgiveness when you found me there. I had also placed a special bed in your ship for us. So no Love, it wasn't intended at all to be spiteful. I am shocked! because I also thought perhaps what you did was a sort of acting out. That you felt rejected by me perhaps and that by my returning to you and being available for you would show you how much I truly cared.
Please Honey, I truly believe that we should try to work out our issues. I thought that I meant enough to you that should we have differences, that you wouldn't just do something mean and hurtful like this as a form of 'getting even?' I truly don't understand as I had no idea that you were angry with me over anything? I'm not a mind reader Sweetheart. I am merely a human being who needs to be treated with reason. What you have done is not reasonable because you never even provided me with a means of defense. Still, the only thing which seems to be quite obvious is that you wanted sex? Well you were certainly about to have what i hoped would be a good time with me <smiles!>.
I know my Love, that i haven't been at work as much for the past couple of months as well. But you know if it had of been you, I would wait until the end of time for you. I would travel to the end of this Universe and beyond for you because 
22:17 I love you more than any man in the Universe. It would be worth the wait to me. It truly would be because I love you so much and you are worth it. Not because you are the handsomest man in the Universe as that's just a wonderful fringe benefit. If you weren't so handsome, I would still love everything about you. We have had interruptions in the time that when I have been here. When you decided to leave and then return, this took a lot of our timewhich we could have enjoyed together. I'm not blaming you for this, just merely pointing out that there have been circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I have been here, you've frequently been involved in space combat and I will admit that I have felt a bit ignored as you had many hours to work yet it seemed that work was more important so you show up around the time when I'm generally going to sleep. How is that enough time to begin our love-making journey?
There is an exception to my love for you and that is I don't love it how you flaunted your actions with someone else to hurt me. Yes I may forgive you for this in time though as I know that men are more physical and often do act out which seems to be what you have done especially if they don't think they are being satisfied. I am so deeply sorry Babe that you went to such lengths and when we are together again and I believe we will be, that you have my assurance that you can always express your concerns to me. You are free to tell me everything you want and you should never hold back. I might not always be comfortable with what you say but we should always have open communications. Honesty is paramount in every relationship which works.
This is no way to call what we have over Love. Relationships are work but I am willing to listen to you and to do whatever it takes to please you. I so want this to work for us. I know that whomever you are with, that your rushing into things is most definitely not going to be good for you. How do you know that she hasn't drawn you in for other selfish reasons? I know that some women who are associated with pirates and other dishonest types will prey upon others who have assets and use sociopathic behavior to take advantage of someone like you. You are a very nice guy and easy-going and you are definitely a target. I love you honestly and sincerely and not for anything other than for you. Yourself had nothing when you met me and although what you have achieved is incredible, it's still a vulnerable spot for you as someone could take advantage of you very easily.
I will leave the garage access open to to you here at Empanda and i am enclosing a couple of starship keys. I just ask you never to bring anyone into my ships without my consent or unless they are mutual friends of ours.
I love you Tibo.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

Tibo,
you have to understand that I am a rather private person. What you said in that mis-com was a bit insightful in that you were saying something to cause Amore to be judgemental by saying 'kitty is refusing thus far'. You only brought up being friends this evening and I never refused that so that's not being fair don't you think? I jus feel that if friends are there to help us both then they should be mutual friends and I don't consider Amore to be a mutual friend as she has not done anything but communicate with just you. Therefore, she is only hearing just your side of the issues. So all you had to say when I asked the first time that you request that amore stay out of our affairs, then you could have come back and said that she was encouraging you to work with me. Then I would certainly be more trusting of her motives. In truth, we do have to be best friends too if we're going to grow into another phase. Friends trust one another and friends have your back. Lovers don't always have those qualities. If all that I can have with you is friendship, then I am willing to be that even though I won't stop loving you. I will just have to keep my feelings to myself. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy sex though as you don't have to love me to have sex with me. I enjoy it with you so I'm willing to accept your sudden change of heart.
As for traveling out to get our ships, I will be very grateful to have your assistance. Also, I 
22:17 am still willing to do additional traveling to help you earn more artifacting points and your Radio Receiver components. I have traveled before with friends and I do enjoy working with you in this respect.
Your friend,
Kitty

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.
