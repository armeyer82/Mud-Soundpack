15:59 A letter
Tibo,
First of all, yes, i talked to cria, because he asked me how i was, and i wanted to talk with someone about it. I didn't know that he would go about it on chatter, or that he would talk to kitty about it. I received the comms kitty sent cria, and they were not nice. Well, as always. I tracked you, but never told anyone where you are. But let's put some things clear:
I don't regret that i talked about it to cria. That he would go about it no chatter was not planned and i was supprised, but i don't feel bad for him doing that. I didn't want it to be a public matter but yeah, he did it, and that's the way it is now.
Second thing, I tracked you because i wanted to know where you are, because i still cared about you. That someone tried to enter your ship was not my fault, I still wonder why you care about that... nothing happened and i guess you are not that stupid to leave your ship unlocked.
Oh, and last but not least, the funniest thing of them all...
You got three ships of mine, which are, two of my expies, and one of my fighters. And you want to keep them with all the things that are in there if i don't do what you want me to.
I am sorry tibo but, the first time i read that letter I just had to laugh my ass off. Really, I don't want to be mean to you but i thought that you are more intelligent. Tell me honestly, Would you do anything for three such useless ships? I don't care about the ships, and didn't even know there was something in them. Whatever it is, I used the expies maybe two times and bought them from others, so the things in there are not even my stuff.
And concerning the fighter,I still got a lot of money i saved up for our future plans, which were apparently not yours, so that is replaced kind of fast. I even think I still have one docked in one of my ships.
Please tell me that letter was not your idea, or a thing you did out of confusion or dispair, because it seems stupid to me.
I don't need to say more about this part of the letter... i think it's self-explanatory that i won't comply to any of your claims and that this was rediculous. I destroyed your keys to these ships and they will just stay where ever they are forever.
Anyhow there's still a thing left i want to tell you. I don't need any revenge or anything, it's not worth it, because it will happen all alone, whithout me doing anything. And if you have any problems with Cria, just deal with them, or ask your girlfriend, wife, or whatever she is, to help you. Whatever you try to tell me or what you try doing to me, I won't help you with that one, you have to do that yourself, also because cria can not be influenced and you should know that wery well.
I don't want to have any problems between you and me either. But the thing i want the most is that you just leave me alone. I don't want to have to do anything with you anymore, that's all.

Miriam,
Yeah right. I'm supposed to believe that? Really? You didn't tell Cria where I was? I have not had that ship for very long. How would he have found it among all of the ships at HG? 
You said you tracked me because you still cared about me and for that reason alone. Yet, right after that you removed me from being able to track you and deleted your private link with me. So sorry, all of this together sure points to you doing more than just tracking me because you cared.
Whether you like it or not, this is the story that is circulating. You have not only to convince me that you don't need revenge, but others as well. 
So you know what? I'll leave you alone as you requested. I won't defend you if the people you've pissed off come after you and I won't tell them to stop hunting you. Trust me, if I told them to stop, they would. I won't help you in any way, shape, or form. Just remember this, to me, it just shows your true colors and that you truly did not love me.
I, however, did not request these people to hunt you. They heard what happened over chatter and drew their anger from what Cria said. So, regardless of what your intentions were, you will end up facing the consequences of your actions as we all do in the end.
As for me, I believe, even more strongly than ever, that I chose the woman who truly loved me. Maybe I'm wrong and of course only time will tell.
Despite all of that, if you ever wish to reconcile, I
16:25  will always be open to it. Life is much too short to harbor anger towards others. Especially, if you truly care about them. Farewell and may fortune favor the foolish.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

17:01 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:01 The sensors are unable to pinpoint the starship's current coordinates.

17:01 You peer out and see...

17:01 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the two-person asteroid hauler "Haulo" powered down here.
You see the six-person destroyer "Hexanity", the six-person dart "Preggnoso Ingorgio", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Fractious Malcontent" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Alphy the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, and Sinister the droid here.
You can go northwest, east, and southwest.
