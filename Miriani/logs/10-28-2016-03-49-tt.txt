-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named
Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, an insulated blue cooler, a high tech silver star print holovid, a
red plastic food storage container, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a
pocket-sized purple holovid, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named
Higgins here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Hello hello,
I have heard back from Space Image place and they have told me to resubmit
photos from aquarium trip. They apologize for clerical error and we should have
proper reward soon once they review again.
Many thanks for everyone's patience with this.

Thanks for the update as we were curious. Could it be that Captain was to have

Books are objects which contain printed information on multiple pages that you
may peruse at your leisure. This might sound obvious, but you would be surprised
how many people ask.
Books possess a few special commands:
OPEN BOOK - Open the book to page one.
CLOSE BOOK - Close the book!
READ BOOK - Read the book's current page.
TURN BOOK TO [NEXT/PREVIOUS] - Turn one page forward or back.
TURN BOOK TO [number] - Turn the book to the specified page number.
READ BOOK [number] - Read a particular page in the book.
In addition, blank books that you can write in are available! These have the
same commands, plus a few additional ones to help you edit them:
WRITE BOOK - Write on the current page.
ERASE [number] IN BOOK - Erase the specified page. You will also be asked if you
wish to replace the page, so you can do this without reordering your pages.
TITLE BOOK IS [anything] - Set the title of your book and finalize it for
publishing.
You may sell your finished book at the Space Market!

Glyphmaker colors
green is blue and yellow Cancel with red
orange is red and yellow cancel with Blue
violet is red and blue cancel with Yellow
indigo is violet and blue cancelled by saffron
fuchsia is violet and red cancelled by chartreuse
ochre is violet and yellow
vermillion is orange and red cancelled by teal
saffron is orange and yellow cancelled by indigo
taupe is orange and blue
chartreuse is green and yellow cancelled by fuchsia
teal is green and blue cancelled by vermillion
sienna is green and red
blue cancel with Orange
Yellow cancel with Violet
If the glyph at the door flashes black, we cancel it. If white, we match it. So
if we get a red one, it'll flash black, flash a blue and a yellow. If we get an
indigo that flashes white, we first make a violet glyph, then a blue one. If
that indigo flashes black, we cancel it by making a saffron glyph (make an
orange glyph, then add yellow).

The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
[PA] Akemi Bando: "Okay, we're leaving!"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.

starship pilots are granted out of necessity -- in space, the only law is
survival of the fittest. When in port, however, even pilots are open to limited
amounts of prosecution for criminal complaints filed by other pilots if the
alleged crime is viewed by the alliance leadership as dangerous to the alliance
or as being against the alliance itself. A voting booth has been erected here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium

Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, an insulated blue cooler, a high tech silver star print holovid, a
red plastic food storage container, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a
pocket-sized purple holovid here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved white top with a colorful butterfly
print, a pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a
light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on
her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are
left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a
light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick
