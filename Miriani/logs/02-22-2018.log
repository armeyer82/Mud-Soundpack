01:01 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below.

To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.

01:15 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:16 #$#soundpack_pong

01:16 #$#soundpack_lag 112

01:16 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:16 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:16 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:16 [Private | Dora West] You transmit, "Hi hi hi!"

01:16 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

01:16 ^Jack West (C) (Male) is awake!

01:16 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:16 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:16 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:17 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:17 #$#soundpack_pong

01:17 #$#soundpack_lag 93

01:17 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:17 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:44 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room] (indoors)
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

02:42 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "yep,"

02:42 You peer north and see...

02:42 ["Dark Bandis" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You can go south and out.

02:42 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "He's just getting mission and such probably"

02:42 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room] (indoors)
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see Shayla the droid here.
You see Moiraine Yobi here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

02:45 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Yep."

02:45 Moiraine Yobi presses a button, calling up the damage report.

02:45 Rob Barret's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "in deed good sir"

02:45 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:45 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:46 #$#soundpack_pong

02:46 #$#soundpack_lag 108

02:46 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.
Cris Smith's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ready lets kills buggs"

02:46 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:46 Olivia Cantrell's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Yeah."

02:46 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:46 Rob Barret's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "let's do that"

You can go northwest.

02:46 There are no damaged components.

02:46 Current coordinates: 12, 1, 7

02:46 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:46 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:46 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:47 #$#soundpack_pong

02:47 #$#soundpack_lag 105

02:47 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:47 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:47 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:47 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:47 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:58 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "I wanted to actually ask some questions about the wedding. Not really from the perspective of just friends, although yes that's true, but more from the perspective of the space, how things looked, felt, maybe get pictures if you guys have some, get your permission to share some of that with others looking to rent the space, etc. It's kinda a mix of...I mean. I just thought we could all talk about things."

03:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:58 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has launched from Rolukssica.

03:58 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:58 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] You transmit, "oh cool"

03:58 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

03:58 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

03:58 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:58 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has left the sector.

03:58 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

03:58 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:58 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

03:59 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:59 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:59 The ship must be in MANUAL mode.

03:59 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

03:59 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

03:59 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "Because no one has actually had to pay to use the space before you guys and we are still trying to design, to perfect, etc, and we don't want to charge too much, we want to know how people feel about things, in case it is wrong or doesn't feel fair or accurate or whatever. Realistic, etc."

03:59 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

03:59 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:59 I don't understand that.

03:59 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

03:59 [Private | Moiraine Yobi] You transmit, "That makes sense."

03:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon.

03:59 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

04:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

04:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:00 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:00 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

14:49 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

[Shadius; Docking Bay]
This dingy, run-down docking bay looks as if it should have been decommissioned years ago. Some kind of brown sludge has taken up residence here over the years, slowly trickling down the walls and collecting in pools on the floor. Puffs of smoke intermittently roll out of the ventilation system, momentarily filling the room with the acrid scent of burned wires and hot metal. Above you, light streams in from the now permanently open docking doors, providing enough illumination to reveal the areas of the docking bay that have been rusted by lack of care and excess rain. The scent of death and decay occasionally wafts in from the north.

The only other interesting thing about the room is the morbidly obese man standing in the corner, obviously attempting to conceal himself in the shadows. Unfortunately, his sheer size and the volume of smoke coming from a cigar hanging out of his mouth makes his attempts at blending in entirely futile. You suspect this might be the location to CLAIM starships. A narrow doorway stands in the southern wall leading to an even more nafarius facility.

This dingy, run-down docking bay looks as if it should have been decommissioned years ago. Some kind of brown sludge has taken up residence here over the years, slowly trickling down the walls and collecting in pools on the floor. Puffs of smoke intermittently roll out of the ventilation system, momentarily filling the room with the acrid scent of burned wires and hot metal. Above you, light streams in from the now permanently open docking doors, providing enough illumination to reveal the areas of the docking bay that have been rusted by lack of care and excess rain. The scent of death and decay occasionally wafts in from the north.

16:40 The four-person roborant "Jazz Funeral" has launched from Rolukssica.

16:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:40 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has left the sector.

16:40 The ship must be in space to do that.

16:40 The ship must be in space to do that.

16:40 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

16:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:40 You press a button to scan for recent wormhole activity.

16:40 No recent wormhole activity detected.

16:40 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:40 The starship is already moving.

16:40 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:40 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:40 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:40 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Jazz Funeral" has left the sector.

16:40 You remove a droid remote titled "acrylon" from a sleek black leather carrying case.

16:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

16:40 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

16:41 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Ooey Gooey Butter Cake You're So Addictive" landed here.

16:47 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door opens.

16:47 (Docking Bay) The one-person fighter "Jellyfish" begins to slowly float through the docking bay door from outside, being carefully guided by a small army of drones and a contingent of spaceport dock workers. After several moments of careful maneuvering, the ship sets down on the docking bay floor and the drones depart with the workers.

16:47 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door closes.

18:23 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

21:19 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Ooey Gooey Butter Cake You're So Addictive" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid the droid, Carmine the droid, Groot the droid, Chi

Smuggling and Catching Smugglers
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Smuggling is the act of trading goods that have been deemed illegal. These goods can be worth quite a bit more than regular trading commodities, but getting caught can also set you back.
  Procedure:
Purchase illegal goods from one trading center and sell them to another.
  Catching Smuggler:
1.) Type TAG in your control room if you suspect someone of carrying illegal goods. If they are, a smuggler ID scan will be created.
2.) Catch them.
3.) Take them to a security center and ARREST <player>
  Stun Traps:
In order to make catching them slightly easier, security centers sell stun traps. In order to use a stun trap, you must SCAN <ID SCAN> INTO TRAP to that it can recognize its target. Once you've done that, drop the trap in a place it's likely your victim will be going. A trading center, perhaps. Once the person enters the room with the stun trap, they will receive a small amount of stun time. If you aren't quick, this will expire and they will get away. So be ready to give them additional stun time.
  Consequences and Rewards:
Once you arrest the person, several things will happen. The person trading the illegal cargo will lose not only the value of their cargo, but also a small penalty based on the number of times they've been caught smuggling illegal goods. The security center will also dispatch patrols to boar
21:20 d all of the person's ships and sieze any illegal cargo found on those ships, which adds to the fine. Whoever turns the person in will receive a reward in the same amount of credits as the other person's fine.
  Illegal Goods:
Cigarettes
Unrefined Cardenium
Effedizine
Biological Components
Metronidizal
Tobacco
Zyprexasil

21:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

21:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

A number of the drones begin floating in the air, each carrying a line until the ship is gently hovering in the air. The drones then begin slowly hauling the ship out of the docking bay, carefully being guided by spaceport workers.

21:23 You should stand up first.

21:23 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

21:29 You peer out and see...

21:29 [Shadius; Docking Bay]
This dingy, run-down docking bay looks as if it should have been decommissioned years ago. Some kind of brown sludge has taken up residence here over the years, slowly trickling down the walls and collecting in pools on the floor. Puffs of smoke intermittently roll out of the ventilation system, momentarily filling the room with the acrid scent of burned wires and hot metal. Above you, light streams in from the now permanently open docking doors, providing enough illumination to reveal the areas of the docking bay that have been rusted by lack of care and excess rain. The scent of death and decay occasionally wafts in from the north.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

22:33 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Shadius; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, and Mekensie the droid here.

This dingy, run-down docking bay looks as if it should have been decommissioned years ago. Some kind of brown sludge has taken up residence here over the years, slowly trickling down the walls and collecting in pools on the floor. Puffs of smoke intermittently roll out of the ventilation system, momentarily filling the room with the acrid scent of burned wires and hot metal. Above you, light streams in from the now permanently open docking doors, providing enough illumination to reveal the areas of the docking bay that have been rusted by lack of care and excess rain. The scent of death and decay occasionally wafts in from the north.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting an orange dog lying on the sofa with a bone hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is closed. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a tiny light turquoise softly padded infant seat supported on rockers, an elegant dark blue water sofa with several pillows scattered across it, a heart-shaped light blue glass coffee table with a blue violet pillar candle sitting on top of it, three gleaming security drones, and a glossy black starship simulator here.

23:30 ["Intergalactic Battle Taxi" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting an orange dog lying on the sofa with a bone hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is closed. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a tiny light turquoise softly padded infant seat supported on rockers, an elegant dark blue water sofa with several pillows scattered across it, a heart-shaped light blue glass coffee table with a blue violet pillar candle sitting on top of it, three gleaming security drones, and a glossy black starship simulator here.
You see Jack West here.

23:48 You peer northwest and see...

23:48 ["Dark Desires" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a well-kept Hale flag depicting a gleaming three dimensional metallic gray crescent moon set against a blank backdrop of steel blue hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret and a black leather crewman chair here.
You see Alexander Martellato here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

23:48 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:48 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:48 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:50 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:50 Meredeth Lancaster's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ha"

23:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:50 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:50 [General Communication] Scarlett Recelli transmits, "You know more than one crew can run at a time."

23:50 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:50 [General Communication] Meredeth Lancaster transmits, "Right?"

23:50 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
