Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Raptor"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a temporary wormhole drive, an

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
L9WQo2-cYQFe]a4Vq2z/QQQi6w[q%3+W7xD|^gK[
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
[Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Lily, what are you doing? Look, I am sorry that
I had to bail but things took longer than expected because of a real threat with
the Bari. It is unwise to continue an op without the defense team."
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Shule. Here is the report I promised you. I hope at the very least it makes it
so that the League doesn't catch you by surprise.
First, the meeting point. IF you are able, meet at the torus, with a secondary
meeting point at Earth if the Torus is inaccessible. Crew large ships first,
then small ships if we are able. Let the larger ships take care of larger
targets, and smaller ships take care of smaller targets. I know it's possible to
beat a larger ship with a smaller, but it's more efficient this way.
The largest ship in the sector has command of the fleet and if they tell a
smaller ship to do something, the smaller ship should listen.
IF two or more ships are engaging the same target, don't go to where the enemy
has just been, or you will open yourself to friendly fire. I know it's not
always possible, but try to stay on different z-axis coordinates than your
allies, that will avoid unnecessary blockages and could cause ships to get hit.
I would like to see this done with all the alliances and have designated z-axis
points for each, but I seriously doubt I can get everyone to go along with that.
If the enemy is an ifs fleet, please refer to the posts about ifs priority on
this board. If you are fighting ifs, it is best to have two or more larger ships
to take turns taking the lrl damage.
I would love to have invasion drills, but my previous attempts to implement them
have been unsuccessful, however, the better prepared we are, the harder it will
be for us to be subjugated again.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
0mV{HwcRZ3Yg=}E3ZMhec*EG>rJ8N5eHP/?'m[%'
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nothing but a couple of pirates
in 286 but Shule is engaging them."
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
[Tactical Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Ah."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Striking Distance.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Shule. Here is the report I promised you. I hope at the very least it makes it
so that the League doesn't catch you by surprise.
First, the meeting point. IF you are able, meet at the torus, with a secondary
meeting point at Earth if the Torus is inaccessible. Crew large ships first,
then small ships if we are able. Let the larger ships take care of larger
targets, and smaller ships take care of smaller targets. I know it's possible to
beat a larger ship with a smaller, but it's more efficient this way.
The largest ship in the sector has command of the fleet and if they tell a
smaller ship to do something, the smaller ship should listen.
IF two or more ships are engaging the same target, don't go to where the enemy
has just been, or you will open yourself to friendly fire. I know it's not
always possible, but try to stay on different z-axis coordinates than your
allies, that will avoid unnecessary blockages and could cause ships to get hit.
I would like to see this done with all the alliances and have designated z-axis
points for each, but I seriously doubt I can get everyone to go along with that.
If the enemy is an ifs fleet, please refer to the posts about ifs priority on
this board. If you are fighting ifs, it is best to have two or more larger ships
to take turns taking the lrl damage.
I would love to have invasion drills, but my previous attempts to implement them
have been unsuccessful, however, the better prepared we are, the harder it will
be for us to be subjugated again.

Hello Johann and Sean,
First please don't share the information below with others as this
is not a planned expedition.
I need to go out to the Aquarium to get a shell for my org. I am
limited on time to be able to be awake to fly my platform for the
better part of each day and my window is up around September 5th so
I need to allow for enough time to travel to and from prior to
then. in order to plan for enough time, I should leave no later
than Monday, August 29th. and preferably over this coming weekend.
Having said this, I want to invite a few to come along and we can
share the eggs. I have all of the varieties of fish but I do want
to claim one of the dark gray snapper eggs. The rest would be up
to the crew to share. I might get another Seastar if I see a color
I don't have though.
If either or both of you would like to come along with Shule and I
and perhaps a couple of others, please let me know what day/time
from after 2359 on Friday, August 26th on until Monday latest.
We'll be flying my Exploration Platform, William Dove. There are
crew quarters available for 4 additional persons besides Shule and
myself or 4 couples as it can accomodate ten crew. However I'm
not particularly interested in taking along 8 more crew. If you
have someone in mind you would like to invite, if they're not going
to room with you, bear in mind that we may have to get organized as
to who rooms where if they are not a part of a couple.
As for Shule and I, we're generally able to fly from about noon GST
until around 0500 the next day but sometimes as late as 1400 on.
We'd like to keep flying so if either you or Sean are typically
awake from around 0500 until 1300, that would be very helpful but
not required. I generally just reduce trim while sleeping so we're
still moving.
Let me know and if you have any thoughts, concerns or whatever.
Best regards,
Lily Kaise

Let me know and if you have any thoughts, concerns or whatever.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a purple photocopier, a round white rattan coffee table

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
pjWWE^)K|x?R;%O-20i+V@Q"|!;F%t`]m+H+P-V,
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
<*=n>[SS!9<qlOz^h_7jrqBe2gJ\gW^QJk&;J'LA
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
