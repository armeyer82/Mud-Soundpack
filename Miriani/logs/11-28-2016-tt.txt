-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, a blue
plastic food storage container, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a compact
white refrigerator, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, Desiree the little black and white spotted

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

which leads to the pilot's lounge is here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

#help action
Command: #action {search string} {commands} {priority}

         Have tintin search for a certain string of text from the mud, if the
         string is found it will execute the commands.  Variables %1 to %99
         are substituted from the input string, and can be used in the command.

         If the search string starts with ~, color codes must be matched, which
         you can see by enabling: #config {convert meta} on.

         The following Perl compatible regular expression options are available:

       ^ force match of start of line.
       $ force match of end of line.
  %1-%99 lazy match of any text, available at %1-%99.
      %0 should be avoided in triggers, and if left alone lists all matches.
     { } embed a raw regular expression, available at %1-%99 + 1.
         [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within
         braces. Keep in mind that { } is replaced with ( ) automatically.

         Of the following the (lazy) match is available at %1-%99 + 1

      %w match zero to any number of letters.
      %W match zero to any number of non letters.
      %d match zero to any number of digits.
      %D match zero to any number of non digits.
      %s match zero to any number of spaces.
      %S match zero to any number of non spaces.

      %? match zero or one character.
      %. match one character.
      %+ match one to any number of characters.
      %* match zero to any number of characters.

      %i matching becomes case insensitive.
      %I matching becomes case sensitive (default).

         Actions can be triggered by the showme command.

Example: #act {^You are hungry$} {get bread backpack;eat bread}
         Performs 2 commands as you get the hunger message, tintin will not
         be fooled by someone saying 'You are hungry'.

Example: #act {%1 tells you 'hello'} {tell %1 Hello %1. How are you today?}
         This allows you to seem like a nice, attentive, fast typing gentleman.

Example: #act {A puppy barks at you, wagging {his|her|its} tail.} {pat puppy}
         This allows you to be nice to puppies regardless of their sex.

Comment: You can remove an action with the #unaction command.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its

curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
Purr the humanoid service robot, a blue plastic food storage container, a clear
plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, Magellan the
arachnoid security robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Subject: Artifact Alpha 777 is once again fully accessible without a rift drive.
Author: Lily Kaise
Posted: 02:51 30 November 2316 GST

Artifact Alpha 777 is once again fully accessible without a rift drive.
To access Artifact Alpha 777, Go to b-24, TRAVEL to 777 and the Rift Accelerator
or Rift Inserter will transport you to Artifact Alpha 777.
There you can search for Artifacts or salvage shipwrecks from 20 to 40 grade.
When you salvage, you can transfer your debris at the Salvage processing station
in the beaconed sector.
To return, be certain that you are in the Artifact Alpha 777 sector and TRAVEL
to Home 776. Then navigate one sector East to B-24.

'Ah, ok. That works.

stations, twice."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Well I didn't say exactly but it will
take a couple of days to get there and a couple of days to get back so if we
just go out there for a day don't you think that is a kind of pushing things?"

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Last call for nests."

come nest with us?"

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If we come under attack, I can't multi
room for one."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "You will have plenty of tiem to think
about your expedition so I don't know what the fuss is all about."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Time."
Lily Kaise sighs.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I asked you and you gave an open-ended
answer when I told you that Johann wanted to leave on the First."
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the south.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok then I just blew over half a billion
credits because I felt you wanted to artifact so I think there is some other
reason why you are hedging."
'ok fine, I already said I'd just postpone the expedition. Can we please just
leave it at that?
You ask, "Ok fine, I already said I'd just postpone the expedition. Can we

it withdraws.
'I don't want to argue all night.
You say, "I don't want to argue all night."

Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders south.
'I'll start thinking about it when we get back.
You say, "I'll start thinking about it when we get back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I don't think 10 to 14 days is
going to create that much of a problem and you expressed to me all along you
wanted to get out of comms and indefinitely."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'll be back."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Sure mister fancy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Fancy?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Why wait to think about things. You will
have a lot of downtime while you are waiting for artifacts."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Yes. Fancy."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "You and your damn taxis."
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches south.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Wow I'm so sad now. I really was looking

A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Because I probably got 150ish or so for
the images and part went to SEAS and I haven't turned in the 3 planets which
would be 30 points."

around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "And when I said that, it was a point of
reference. I, in no way have any issues with your cruiser support."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well a conquest is 4 days so yes 36 to
40 days."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway, the images did pay out while you
were in SEAS."

don't think it's an over-exaggeration when I've invested in 3 Fusion batteries
which cost 120 million each as has Johann plus many other modules and time."
'We did the trip out to the aquarium, twice actually. We went to try to find

I want to be back in time to renew stations for 777 and they will go down in
about 14 or 15 days. I'd prefer to be back before then bue I was hoping for a

You can go up.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Lily Kaise glides in from above.

something new! Our crew consists of Melinda Michaels, Joel Kringle, Soraya Rhyz,
Bryan Stout, Pierre-Louis "Bob 'Pierre-Louis' Johnson" Tremblay-du-Lys, Annie
Lynn, Nissi Valdaire, Liam O'Toole, Rayne Song, Nicolette Lawrence, Keegan
Wantz, Damien Alexander, Elira Waters, Jessica Talavera, Lily Kaise, and Akemi
Bando (myself).
In addition to the galleon itself, Pierre's juno "Poutine Au Poulet Pour Trois
Personnes" is stashed in the docking bay. It'll serve if we need to do any
fighting.
I anticipate this might be an interesting trip. Even if it isn't, it doesn't
hurt to keep track of what we see and do; which is what this journal's for.
We started by using the rift accelerator east of Coreward Reach to fling us
toward Exploration Waypoint 62652, the Radio Bubble beacon. From there, the plan
is to go along course 10.0 -60.0 until we find something really interesting, or
we've hit the edge of our range.
We've got a good crew, with the newest traveler being Soraya (though she's
decently experienced the way I reckon things).
"Nocturnal Flight" has an endurance of 3 days, 9 hours, and 15 minutes with
certain systems powered down and a slightly overloaded life-support system.
Since it is fitted with a fusion blast chamber, we can refuel anywhere there is
a debris field. Oort clouds are pretty common, and actual wreckage fields not
too uncommon, so it's a good bet we'll be able to manage just fine. The plan is
to spend about ten days out, which is mostly dictated by how quickly the blast
furnace ends up needing servicing by a qualified port.
The ship has really nice sensors, and of course boasts the galleon rigging that
makes going against the riftflow much easier. It should be a good trip, and the
galleon is a great choice for it.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

to gather bari spredder corpses, but when I try to salvage them I get told that
my grapple is not appropriate for the objects. Where can I get an appropriate
one?"

The spaceport here is little more than a fenced-off concrete pad in an open
field with several buildings around it. Notably, a newly opened ITPN station is
housed to the east. Farms cover the rolling hills in the distance, with a single
town visible in the landscape toward the northeast. Most of the people passing
through here appear to be down on their luck, pausing to study the job notices
plastered over a kiosk near the entrance. A sprawling collection of buildings
surround the landing pad at a safe distance.

of established Ardsley businesses relocated from elsewhere in town, including

of farms and hills, though some of the once open acreage is now occupied by new
housing developments.

The buildings here are an interesting mix of pretty new shops, utilitarian
warehouses, and old homes predating the war. Beyond the buildings on the north
side of the street is a new housing area built on a hill. To the south, front
and center in a new cluster of businesses, is Sparkles, a toiletries store with
many sparkly items in the spotlessly clean display windows. Beyond the rooftops
of Sparkles and the other businesses there is Ardsley's landscape of farms and
rolling hills, though new building has recently encroached upon the open lands.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, and a silky
cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.

I was just going to put them together so all you had to do was get Angel or Kim
go go out with you. We'll be back in time to put up the next salvage processor."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You could just ask us to put
it up. I certainly don't mind, but I can't launch your constructor, just ours."

can get the parts together just fine. I've done it before."

about 7 days left so it will need replacement."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'll let you know if anything
further develops."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Then if you ask, I don't mind
getting it together. It makes it easier if you don't put all the parts on a ship
that very few folks can launch."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Seriously morris I
alrady had them."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay, just hang onto your
stuff for the next one. We can get rid of the processor on Kim's ship this
time."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I think I saw one on there
from when they were putting stuff up when you all went to the aquarium or
something."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That works and Morris we had them
there already so it just works out that way. Problem is solved and you have
parts on Cats from us so all good."

tra org Yep
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Before we all get into
another argument, there are too many orgs and not enough station parts. Somebody
gets left behind on something most times. However, the roid station is one that
we can get six parts on so we shouldn't have issues."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't want morris to
do those two stations because he will conveniently forget as he has done
before."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm talking about her
complaining about building at 285...all the responsibility she had, when she
actually didn't have it in the first place, then took more on."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Since we're not in
that stupid book, we're prone to being overlooked."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Who does the accelerator at
285?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kim and I."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're

Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be
annoying, but it's not!"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Huh who is complaining!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well neither of us
have ever complained about 285."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I just don't want a repeat of
it is all I'm saying."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We actually enjoy putting up
stations. I was merely trying to be certain things were covered while we left.
That's just being considerate."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, it is. And I appreciate
it greatly."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The book is good but as for many
books, soon after publicaiton, they are out of date hehe."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Publication."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, it needs a couple
updates."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Are you talking about the temp
station booklet?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Is there a salvage processor, an
asteroid processor, and an external inserter rift accelerator and beacon out at
285?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Not complaining. It just happens
with material like that. It's a handy guide no doubt but when new organizations
come along, it's easy to overlook them."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is currently, yes."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We've got to many
organizations now. If another new one comes along, I am going on strike."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Then the book is still perfectly
up to date. I have in no way assigned parts to any organization and you guys are
the ones that decided to not put things up the way they are outlined in the
book."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are a couple of errors
that I know of...the heading to 285 and a thing with the roid station where it's
missing a part."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh yeah and we don't incorporate
a recharger on the Salvage processor anymore either."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Again, that was a choice you
guys made."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Not meh!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow time is flying!"
tra org Yeah, it is.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, it is."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "How is the heading wrong?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's in the book as 70 for the
vertical. It should be 78."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If you aren't putting a
charger on the salvage, you can use a better wormhole module from Ather."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, one of the parts for the
roid processor is missing in the book."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I'll have to look at the book
when I get back to check for the missing part. 8 degrees doesn't matter."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Either elevation heading will
get you back to 286."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have to nap in about
45 minutes for awhile. After then, I'll wrap things up which means getting pets
over to the transport. If you have time for that in between, tha's fine but it
should be easy enough to do around 2200 or earlier when I'm awake."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. I was told that much would
make a difference. That's all I know."
tra org Ok, I'll see if I can do that.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It won't make a
difference."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, I'll see if I
can do that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, Erik and I are landing
now."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "And just so you know. I got
those headings off the stations themselves long before the book was written."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know. The station was moved
after that, though...at least that's what I was told."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "But I'll get the missing part
thing fixed. Please point out any other mistakes to me if you find them."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Will do."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So I'll get food for
us, food bowls from dove, pets and the stuff on the hoverpallet and that's about
all I can think of. I already setup my robots for the felo."
tra org Ok, thanks.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, thanks."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Please if you can help
with any or at least pick up some food you like."
tra org I will.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I will."

the last minute so it will remain fresh a little longer."

tra org Oh, thanks. I was going to take care of that. Thanks though.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, thanks. I was
going to take care of that. Thanks though."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I went over to
transfer stuff form happy so I went ahead since I was in dove already."
tra org Ah, ok
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah, ok."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Just made logical
sense."

almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I need to nap
momentarily but I accidentally left Magellan in Happy when I went to get purr
out of there and put it in the transport. I can do without him but would like to
have him aboard and of course your Kiska is in here."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Industrial parks have sprung up along both sides, a mix of prefab warehouses and
rather shabby trailers. Loads of goods on pallets sit around outside on the

[Starship "Alanna Butts"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]
About ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, this section
of smoothly finished gray corridor curves slightly as part of the outer ring of
the station, commonly called the Outring. Polished metal girders protrude from
the walls, which arch gradually to meet overhead. Though the light here is never
bright, the tall glowing panels recessed into the walls provide a steady
illumination. On the east side of this area is a wide, open hatch leading into a
spacious corridor extending toward the center of the station. Smaller hatches
follow the outring around the station to the north and south, and the sounds of
ships landing and launching often comes from the corridor leading west from
here. In one corner of the intersection, a narrow circular set of stairs leads
down to a lower level.

Ancient office buildings dominate this block. Though many of them bear signs of
having fallen into disrepair in the past, in their worn and dirty brick facades
and crumbling ornamental designs, New Phoenix's businesses displaced by the war
have begun moving in, rejuvenating the entire area. New offices now occupy the
old buildings, and even though outward repairs have begun only slowly, the area
already has a bustling atmosphere. A leveled building has been replaced with a
small plaza. A small hair care shop has recently opened here.

Though not completely restored, the old office buildings along this part of
Japan Boulevard are already home to new businesses. Two new shops are directly
next to each other in the same building: 'Freneza,' which has in its front
windows displays of hosiery, belts, and odd-looking bracelets; and 'Studdedly,'
which occupies the corner of the building and advertises with hand-made signs
its low-priced stock of wrist bands and chokers. A number of glum and edgy
people seem to hang around these shops, their spiked hair and unique dress
setting them apart from the usual shoppers.

an old but ornate building on the south side of the boulevard that is now

This block of Japan Boulevard has recently begun a commercial rejuvenation.
Where it was somewhat rundown before the war, the infusion of money from private
businesses has brought a new atmosphere of bustle and success to the area. On
the lower floor of a brick building on the northern side of the street, a
delightful-looking breakfast restaurant with a large plate glass window in the
front has just opened. 'Colt's Kitchen and Catering' is painted across the
window in cheerful red letters. The Boulevard continues both to the east and
west.

[New Phoenix; Mexico Lane]
The scent of Mexican foods drifts toward you from the northwest. The AEU's
blackened tower looms above the smallish buildings here, but no one seems to pay
it any mind. The buildings seem to be mainly restaurants and wholesale shops.
Even though the entire area is rather dingy and poor-looking, as if the
colonists from the third world areas of Old Earth simply recreated their old
life here on new soil, it seems to have suffered little from the war. Business
is lively and the sounds of conversation in old languages can be heard all along
the street.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", the two-person medium transport
"Money Maker", and the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Saving Our Can!" are
landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
