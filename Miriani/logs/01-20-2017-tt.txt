Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with Blueberry the
sleeping hefty violet feathered felo on it, a round white rattan coffee table
with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash
bin, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red
aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid
service robot, Xavier the big silver soldier felo, and Prissy the big violet
long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
