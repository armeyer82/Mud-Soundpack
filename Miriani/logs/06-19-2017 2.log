00:18:11 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

00:26:44 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:26:51 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

00:26:51 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 2464-0747 about 21.17 light-grand cycles toward Galactic East and Very Slightly Up.
A riftstorm appears to be 1.68 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Up and Slightly Eastsoutheast.

00:27:19 Morris Corlew says, "Oort."

00:28:34 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:28:42 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

00:28:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Very exciting."

00:35:24 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Are we going after the oort or is that one of the things Nissi said to ignore?"

00:35:49 Lily says to Sarah, "No oorts or asteroid clusters."

00:35:51 Morris Corlew says, "Nah. Oorts are pretty common..."

00:35:52 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

00:35:54 Sarah Bellamy nods.

00:35:59 Sarah Bellamy says, "Okay."

00:36:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:39:00 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I am still confident."

00:50:00 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

00:50:10 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

00:50:41 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

00:50:43 You take a bite of an orange scone.

00:50:45 You take a bite of an orange scone.

01:42:39 Morris Corlew says, "Lost the oort too."

01:44:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, we can come back to oort if we wanted, but storm is gone forever."

01:44:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sniffles.

01:44:33 Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:44:37 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

01:44:48 You chuckle.

01:46:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:50:37 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

01:50:47 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

02:51:55 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

02:53:59 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

02:54:09 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

02:55:26 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

03:10:56 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Woo!"

03:11:00 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:11:01 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.
Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire.

03:11:33 Nissi Valdaire says, "Whenever we stop again and run the nav thing, it's probably about time to actually aim at Farport."

03:51:43 Minor Change:

03:51:44 
Probe capacity has been adjusted based on ship size, mostly adding probes.

Databanks capacity has been reduced globally since it seemed to be too large to even be a consideration.

Discovery payouts have been tweaked slightly several times, both up and down depending on discovery type and operation performed. When examining the summary, look to the latest discoveries to get a more accurate picture. In particular, early planet rewards were paying out too much.

04:20:15 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

04:20:22 Morris Corlew waves to Rogue Romano.

04:20:43 You wave to Rogue Romano.

04:20:46 You say to Rogue Romano, "Hi."

04:20:49 Rogue Romano waves.

04:21:42 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

04:21:45 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

04:21:50 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

04:21:54 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

04:24:00 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

04:24:21 Something tickles the back of your neck.

04:28:18 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

04:28:37 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:29:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:34:27 [MTTS] wulf: There was a lot of data space for sure, perhaps still quite a fair bit of room left even now. Although I'd assume the top spectro tools and lander probes extra data using will make it more tight.

04:34:31 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

04:34:36 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

04:40:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:40:37 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:41:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I might guide ship to next thing found, I have not done any navigation on this journey yet."

04:45:05 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

04:45:14 Morris rubs his arms.

04:50:37 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:51:28 You stretch.

04:51:30 You yawn.

04:51:38 You say, "Good night all."

04:51:42 You wave.

04:51:44 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:51:45 Morris says to you, "Rest well."

04:51:52 You say to Morris, "Thanks."

04:51:56 Morris Corlew nods.

04:52:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:52:05 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]

04:53:10 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:53:20 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

04:53:23 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:53:27 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

04:53:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

04:53:35 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

04:53:39 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:53:52 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

04:53:57 Lily Kaise puts a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:54:01 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:54:38 Lily says to you, "You going to sleep with those sneaks on Love?"

04:55:33 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

04:55:38 I don't understand that.

04:56:02 Shule Elemmire glances down at himself, "Oh, guess not the best idea, huh?"

04:56:08 You chuckle.

04:56:12 You sit up.

04:56:17 Remove what?

04:56:20 You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers off of your feet.

04:56:23 You put down a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers.

04:56:25 Lily Kaise chuckles at you.

04:56:41 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

04:56:47 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:56:51 Listen. You need to be careful.

04:58:35 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:00:00 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:01:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:07:08 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:07:21 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:07:22  You are wearing a black shipsuit with silver trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of white socks. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

05:07:22 You are carrying nothing.

05:08:31 Lily says to you, "I so love you. I am so glad you were able to come along on this trip."

05:08:52 "I so love you too." You smile at Lily Kaise. "I'm really glad I was able to make it too."

05:08:59 Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:09:42 Shule gently playsw with your hair.

05:09:47 Lily Kaise smiles.

05:09:55 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:10:03 You say to Lily, "Good night. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:10:11 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:10:24 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you."

05:10:36 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I love you too."

05:10:42 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:10:52 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:26:41 You're not imagining it. This is real.

05:37:15 So much pain. For what?

05:38:31 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

05:47:42 You're really alone here. So very alone.

05:49:01 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.

05:55:01 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly east.

05:57:18 Remember what I said.

05:57:28 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

06:00:00 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

06:19:12 The ship's reactionless drive lets out a sudden whine as the starship accelerates quickly.

06:29:48 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

06:39:20 The ship's reactionless drive lets out a sudden whine as the starship accelerates quickly.

06:50:01 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

06:50:04 The starship suddenly lurches in a new direction. Something must be wrong with the inertial dampeners.

06:51:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's the policy on system probes by now?"

06:51:51 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think still rocky or green, but not sure."

06:52:10 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, system probes. Uh...not sure. She did say use up the probes earlier."

06:52:30 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What?"

06:52:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What?"

06:53:36 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There is none now."

06:53:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "None what?"

06:54:00 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "None policy."

06:54:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Will follow none policy then."

06:54:39 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think we are probing planets, maybe not system."

06:55:21 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I would say save one of each for something unexpected at very least."

06:56:09 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ather has probes."

06:58:36 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

06:58:46 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

06:59:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I also don't have the key to his bolt."

06:59:10 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Then save a couple."

06:59:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How about I start with extended observation for system while we survey, yes?"

06:59:52 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

06:59:59 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

06:59:59 The room grows a bit more chill.

07:00:11 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:00:11 The room grows a bit warmer.

07:01:11 The room grows a bit more chill.

07:01:16 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I believe that Nissi's thinking is, we are near the thousand light-years from home. So, we won't be stopping much."

07:01:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There certainly wasn't much good stars near Farport."

07:01:47 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup."

07:10:13 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Also, Nissi said it's probably time to aim more towards Farport rather than just up."

07:11:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I will ask Comrade Mainframe where we are."

07:16:38 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:16:38 The room grows a bit warmer.

07:16:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am joyed to report we are closer than we were."

07:17:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

07:17:39 The room grows a bit more chill.

07:22:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

07:23:08 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:23:08 The room grows a bit warmer.

07:23:54 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's right, turn up the heat. It was gettin' chilly down here."

07:24:08 The room grows a bit more chill.

07:24:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Deploy the tub."

07:24:19 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bob, heat, up."

07:27:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

07:29:25 The room grows a bit more chill.

07:31:00 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:31:00 The room grows a bit warmer.

07:31:08 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:35:29 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:37:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:41:28 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

07:41:34 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly east.

07:44:39 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:51:57 Something tickles the back of your neck.

07:52:24 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:57:49 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:57:49 The room grows a bit more chill.

07:58:34 The room grows a bit warmer.

07:59:06 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

07:59:09 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

07:59:09 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:59:17 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

07:59:20 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yay Bob!"

07:59:54 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

08:00:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

08:03:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably not gonna be good planets or many of them, gonna send impact probes on them."

08:10:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:15:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:16:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly east.

08:16:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:16:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:16:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:17:26 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

08:18:35 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night everyone."

08:18:42 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night Rogue."

08:18:48 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well, Rogue."

08:18:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nights."

08:18:57 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sleep good."

08:25:44 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

08:53:05 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "T-minus seven minutes and fiteen seconds until maximum probing is reached."

08:53:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

08:55:55 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo!"

08:56:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:56:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

08:57:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

09:00:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are go."

09:00:42 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

09:00:49 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

09:00:59 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

09:01:00 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

09:01:02 The starship has left a unique area of space.

09:01:10 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

09:03:09 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wait I forgot my hat out there."

09:03:25 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Good luck findin it now."

09:15:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

09:18:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:20:41 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

09:30:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:31:16 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

09:35:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

09:41:35 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

09:42:51 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

09:49:15 The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

09:49:16 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

09:57:43 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

09:57:53 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

09:57:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

09:58:01 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repairs crushed."

09:58:03 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

09:58:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

10:03:59 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sleep good, Morris."

10:04:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank ya kindly Luja."

10:27:54 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

10:28:54 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:39:18 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

10:49:31 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

10:59:36 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

10:59:47 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

11:12:48 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

11:15:57 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

11:29:38 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

11:40:19 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

11:40:21 Anfisa the Wanderer's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well, Eli."

11:42:41 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "To you as well."

11:50:37 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

12:00:54 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

12:01:35 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

12:01:44 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

12:23:15 Lily Kaise kisses you.

12:23:20 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

12:23:26 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

12:23:32 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

12:31:35 Something tickles the back of your neck.

12:41:53 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

12:52:19 You hear something fall in the next room.

13:02:41 Something tickles the back of your neck.

13:02:47 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

13:02:57 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

13:32:48 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

13:43:27 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

13:45:34 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

13:46:17 You wave.

13:46:19 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

13:46:19 A readout shows Asteroid Cluster 0483-1243 about 18.5 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Down.

13:46:41 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

13:47:06 You say, "Hi all."

13:47:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

13:47:57 You smile at Melinda Michaels.

13:48:03 Melinda says to you, "How's it going?"

13:48:13 You say to Melinda, "Not too bad. How are you?"

13:48:28 Melinda says to you, "Pretty good."

13:48:36 You grin. "Glad to hear it."

13:49:42 Anfisa the Wanderer finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

13:49:48 Anfisa the Wanderer gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

13:50:59 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

13:51:04 You wave to Rogue Romano.

13:51:44 Rogue Romano waves to you.

13:51:49 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

13:51:51 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

13:51:54 I can't find someone with the name 'dora'.

13:51:57 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

13:52:10 Melinda says to Rogue, "Hey."

13:52:36 Rogue says to Melinda, "Hey there beautiful."

13:52:45 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

13:53:40 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

13:54:59 Melinda Michaels says, "We are under a thousand light-years to Farport."

13:55:09 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo!"

13:55:15 You say, "Ah, ok."

13:55:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Verly slightly under."

13:55:33 Rogue Romano grins.

13:55:37 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

13:55:47 You ask, "Like 999.999?"

13:55:57 Melinda Michaels laughs. "No, a little more."

13:56:03 You grin.

13:56:04 Rogue Romano smirks.

13:57:38 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

14:04:08 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

14:06:43 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

14:07:01 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

14:07:11 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

14:08:33 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

14:12:38 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

14:13:38 An orange digital felo game beeps plaintively for food.

14:13:47 Jason Rat presses a button on an orange digital felo game.

14:13:47 An orange digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

14:13:57 Jason Rat presses a button on an orange digital felo game.

14:13:57 An orange digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

14:24:43 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

14:26:30 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

14:37:03 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

14:47:15 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

14:57:38 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

15:08:28 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

15:08:54 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

15:09:04 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

15:10:41 Rogue Romano asks, "Oh, we're actually travellin' in the direction towards farport?"

15:10:44 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

15:10:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

15:10:56 Rogue Romano nods.

15:12:07 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

15:12:13 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

15:17:41 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:28:11 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

15:32:44 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

15:39:08 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

15:39:08 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

15:39:28 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]

15:39:28 A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', and a

You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

15:40:29 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

15:42:48 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

15:44:49 Luja Garland yawns.

15:44:54 You wave to Luja Garland.

15:45:21 Luja Garland says, "Time to sleep. On my bunk, this time."

15:45:25 Luja Garland stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

15:45:31 You say to Luja, "Rest well."

15:45:36 You smile at Luja Garland.

15:45:45 Luja says to you, "Thanks."

15:45:48 Luja Garland smiles at you.

15:45:50 Luja Garland waves.

15:45:51 Luja Garland steps south.

15:46:48 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

15:50:31 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

15:50:36 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

15:50:39 Rogue Romano slinks east.

15:50:41 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

15:52:44 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

15:52:58 Rogue Romano slinks in from the east.

15:53:04 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

15:53:12 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

15:53:17 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

15:53:20 Rogue Romano carefully unwraps a grilled cheese sandwich.

15:53:23 Rogue Romano picks up half of a grilled cheese sandwich and takes a huge bite.

15:56:43 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

15:58:44 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

16:00:43 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

16:00:55 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

16:10:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

16:10:36 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

17:22:48 Rogue Romano suddenly awakens.

17:28:50 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

17:33:22 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

17:33:40 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

17:33:49 Morris says to Damien Goss, "Yo."

17:33:53 Damien Goss nods to Morris Corlew.

17:34:04 Damien Goss steps east.

17:34:15 Damien Goss steps in from the east.

17:34:18 Damien Goss sits down.

17:34:20 Damien Goss glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

17:34:24 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

17:34:52 Rogue Romano waves to Damien Goss.

17:35:03 Damien Goss nods to Rogue Romano.

17:35:14 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:42:03 Vernos Bailey waves to Damien Goss.

17:42:13 Damien Goss nods to Vernos Bailey.

17:42:26 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

17:42:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Just about 900 to go."

17:43:40 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

17:44:50 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

17:45:53 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

17:46:50 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:48:51 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

17:51:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

17:51:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec gives a bottle to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

17:51:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Woo and such."

17:52:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

17:52:04 Rogue Romano says, "Allo glorious Bob."

17:52:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec takes a sip of a frosted square glass of sweet red caribou.

17:52:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Many allos."

17:52:50 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:53:47 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

17:58:45 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot cheeseburger with the works.

18:03:56 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

18:04:07 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot cheeseburger with the works.

18:11:45 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

18:11:55 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

18:12:01 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot cheeseburger with the works.

18:12:38 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

18:47:46 Vernos Bailey says, "Like waking cycle."

18:47:52 Vernos Bailey says, "What a cycle is."

18:47:57 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

18:48:08 Morris Corlew says, "I think..."

18:48:09 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

18:48:11 Morris Corlew removes an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done' from a maple coffee table.

18:48:16 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

18:48:22 Morris Corlew puts down a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

18:49:02 Morris rifles through an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done'.

18:50:01 Morris Corlew puts an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done' on a maple coffee table.

18:50:04 Morris Corlew removes a copy of "The Antispinward Expedition" from a metallic silver messenger bag.

18:50:09 Morris Corlew puts a copy of "The Antispinward Expedition" in an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done'.

18:50:11 Morris Corlew removes a copy of "Handy Hints: Antispinward Trading" from a metallic silver messenger bag.

18:50:14 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

18:50:20 Rogue Romano slinks south.

18:50:23 "I think it's talked about in here maybe?" Morris Corlew taps a copy of "Handy Hints: Antispinward Trading".

18:50:45 Morris says to Vernos, "Can borrow it if you want. Just put it in the box when you're done?"

18:50:51 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

18:51:02 Morris says to Vernos, "Not one I can replace if it were to get lost."

18:51:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Quite a few books out there like that it seems."

18:51:26 Morris Corlew nods. "Tons."

18:51:26 Melinda Michaels asks, "What are we talking about?"

18:51:35 Morris says to Melinda, "Terms like 'waking cycle'"

18:51:40 Morris Corlew gives a copy of "Handy Hints: Antispinward Trading" to Vernos Bailey.

18:51:47 Morris Corlew picks up a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

18:51:48 Melinda Michaels laughs. "I never read that book."

18:51:59 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

18:52:03 Morris says to Melinda, "It's..."

18:52:04 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

18:52:16 Melinda Michaels says, "Waking cycle is the cyle in which you are awake. In other words, your waking hours."

18:52:21 Morris Corlew says, "Not 100% accurate about some things. But somewhat useful."

18:52:38 Vernos Bailey says, "I was thinking more for pilot terms for dummies."

18:52:51 Melinda Michaels says, "It's best to learn some things by asking."

18:52:56 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

18:53:04 Melinda Michaels says, "No need to hold everybody's hand with everything in a book."

18:53:07 Morris Corlew says, "Can't learn everything from a book."

18:53:31 Morris Corlew says, "Sol got so upset Anfisa's book didn't give instructions on how to repair the rift drive. If he'd just spoken to folks about it..."

18:53:31 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

18:53:47 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:53:54 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

18:53:58 Melinda Michaels says, "Spoon feeding people is not always good."

18:54:02 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

18:54:56 Morris Corlew finishes off a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

18:55:01 Morris Corlew gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

18:55:03 Morris Corlew pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

18:56:29 Vernos Bailey says, "I've been trying to come up with something since Ather was not interested in my take on the AEU upgrade book."

18:56:55 Morris Corlew asks, "Your take on the upgrade book?"

18:57:21 Vernos Bailey says, "I offered to take over since it sounded like he was tired of doin git."

18:57:29 Vernos Bailey says, "Doing it I mean."

18:57:51 Morris Corlew says, "Ah, I see."

18:59:00 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."

18:59:22 Morris Corlew asks, "I know it's got a couple things out of date, seems that'd be a quick fix though?"

19:00:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Well I'd keep the arrow and the magnetar in there but on a page at the back saying no longer manifactured due to lack of interest."

19:00:44 Vernos Bailey says, "That way it might generate interest."

19:00:59 Morris Corlew asks, "And he wanted to...just leave them out?"

19:01:35 Vernos Bailey says, "Well it was not discussed in significant detail, he says he only trusts himself to wrte it."

19:01:47 Morris Corlew nods.

19:01:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Write it, damn I should do coffee before even attempting to tallk."

19:02:07 Morris Corlew says, "I guess I'd be a bit hesitant about handin over one of my books to somebody else though too."

19:02:17 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

19:02:40 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh I don't blame him for it at all."

19:02:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Not a single bit."

19:03:02 Morris Corlew nods.

19:03:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Fresh eyes do however bring fresh perspectives."

19:03:43 "That's why I have folks proofread for me." Morris Corlew smiles. "Have had a number of things fixed that way."

19:03:54 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:04:43 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Melinda Michaels. "One of my favorite proofreaders."

19:05:38 Vernos Bailey says, "Yes though, I would leave those two in the back with a note on why they were stopped and what could potientally bring them back one day."

19:06:09 Morris Corlew asks, "Has the government given y'all an indication that it could happen?"

19:06:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Not really but I think of Best as the type of man that would support it if it helped the AEU."

19:07:01 Morris Corlew says, "Well..."

19:07:07 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

19:07:38 Morris Corlew says, "We might just have to agree to disagree on that one."

19:08:51 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

19:09:29 Vernos Bailey says, "Well I don't agree with some of his policies or ideas but just perhaps he could be convinced through beneficial actions."

19:09:41 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

19:10:04 Vernos Bailey says, "I have been thinking about that a lot this trip."

19:10:57 Morris Corlew says, "Seems a lotta thinkin happens on these trips."

19:10:58 Morris Corlew smiles.

19:11:29 Vernos says to Morris, "Plus he has not banned exploration, so it has to fit somewhere."

19:12:25 "Quite true." Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey. "Just...taken away the nice toys. Makes me wonder...with his focus on military if y'all'll get some nice new warships."

19:12:40 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

19:12:49 Vernos Bailey says, "Only he knows."

19:12:50 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

19:13:18 Morris Corlew nods.

19:14:24 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:14:47 Vernos Bailey says, "I will aim myself to make exploration important enough for him to consider but without being extremeist."

19:15:09 Morris Corlew nods. "Extremism don't help things historically."

19:15:26 Vernos Bailey says, "No it does not."

19:30:51 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

19:42:41 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

19:46:51 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

19:48:22 Damien Goss finishes off a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

19:48:27 Damien Goss gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

19:50:51 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:51:51 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:51:59 Morris Corlew says, "Nebula."

19:52:51 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:53:29 A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.

19:57:55 Vernos Bailey asks, "Go back for it?"

19:58:08 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Not from Nissi's previous instructions."

19:58:14 Vernos Bailey nods.

19:58:42 Vernos Bailey asks, "What are we stopping for now?"

19:59:47 Morris Corlew says, "Probably planets. This close doubt we'd find much else like neutron stars or pulsars or whatnot."

20:03:35 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

20:04:52 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

20:06:51 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

20:13:40 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

20:13:50 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

20:15:43 Vernos Bailey says, "I'd be interested in a trip to try and push 3000."

20:16:20 Morris Corlew nods.

20:23:56 Vernos Bailey says, "One to see if we could."

20:24:09 Vernos Bailey says, "And to see what we would find."

20:24:25 Morris Corlew nods.

20:24:52 Vernos Bailey says, "I bet you'd need at least the battery this ship has plus three recharge stations."

20:25:01 Vernos Bailey says, "And a furnance."

20:25:24 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm. Even a mod transport with a siren battery would have much less charge than this ship."

20:25:43 Morris Corlew says, "War galleon can only carry 7 station parts, same as a mod scout, so that's only one station."

20:25:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Hm."

20:26:51 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:26:53 Morris Corlew says, "With optimizations on the augmented explorer with the uh...integration upgrade...you might be able to make that 3K."

20:30:15 Vernos Bailey asks, "You mean the goo?"

20:30:20 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.

20:30:44 Morris Corlew says, "The longer someone is...interfaced with the ship, the lower the drain rate due to optimizations they can...accomplish."

20:33:20 Morris Corlew says, "Anfisa could explain it much better than I could ever hope to."

20:36:51 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:37:10 Vernos Bailey says, "I do wonder if with the help of a station or two could this ship push 3000."

20:38:01 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "Well...you would have to pre-place stations using another ship. I'd have to double-check, but I'm nearly certain this ship can't quite hold a mod scout."

20:38:08 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:38:09 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:38:10 Morris Corlew lopes south.

20:38:23 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

20:38:24 Morris Corlew nods.

20:38:27 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:39:14 Morris Corlew says, "Pretty sure a mod scout is 65 docking units. This ship will hold 45."

20:41:40 Morris Corlew says, "Honestly not sure what battery either of the galleons that can get that docking bay conversion to carry 7 station parts have. Pierre and Nissi would know."

20:42:52 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

20:43:41 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

20:44:10 Eli Grey walks in from the south.

20:44:17 Morris says to Eli Grey, "Howdy."

20:44:22 Morris says to Eli Grey, "Rest well?"

20:44:50 Eli Grey says, "Hey, there folks."

20:45:01 Eli says to Morris, "Yeah.. I slept alright."

20:45:03 Eli rubs his eyes.

20:45:05 Damien Goss waves.

20:45:09 Morris Corlew nods.

20:45:25 Eli Grey says, "All goes well in here i'm guessing."

20:45:31 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

20:46:15 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "No! It's terrible!"

20:46:43 Damien Goss says, "Wonderfully horrible."

20:46:52 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:46:52 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

20:46:56 Eli says to Nissi, "See? This is what happens when we stop asking you waht to do."

20:47:04 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

20:47:05 Morris Corlew chuckles.

20:53:49 Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:54:14 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

20:54:52 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

21:00:51 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

21:04:22 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

21:14:35 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

21:14:38 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

21:14:48 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

21:14:59 Morris Corlew says, "Hum."

21:18:52 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:23:16 I see no "lily" here.

21:26:52 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

21:32:44 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

21:34:08 Morris says to Rogue Romano, "Yo."

21:34:13 Rogue Romano nods to Morris Corlew.

21:34:17 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

21:34:19 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

21:34:24 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

21:36:52 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

21:40:52 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:44:40 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

21:44:58 Morris Corlew wrinkles his nose.

21:48:21 Ather Jammoa slumps in a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it and goes to sleep.

21:48:52 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:51:20 Rogue Romano glances down at her platinum watch with a round face momentarily.

21:51:34 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

21:51:36 Rogue Romano slinks south.

21:54:53 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

21:56:52 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:05:24 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

22:15:35 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

22:16:53 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

22:17:03 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

22:18:38 Morris Corlew says, "This is better."

22:20:52 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

22:22:52 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

22:39:57 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

22:42:52 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:46:54 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

22:50:11 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

22:52:52 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:54:35 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

22:54:53 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:56:52 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

23:04:59 A hooded, indistinct figure rowing a floating bathtub raises one arm and waves at you as the truck passes.

23:05:08 Morris Corlew waves.

23:05:35 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

23:06:59 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:07:01 Morris Corlew lopes south.

23:10:52 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

23:11:38 Ather Jammoa suddenly awakens.

23:14:53 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:15:05 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:15:19 Melinda Michaels stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

23:15:21 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:15:22 A readout shows Planetary System 3505-7804 about 7.42 light-grand cycles toward Galactic South and Very Slightly Up.

23:15:26 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

23:15:36 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

23:15:40 The hovertruck smoothly negotiates a turn, tilting slightly so you are not thrown off the trailer.

23:16:36 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

23:16:51 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

23:16:54 Morris Corlew says, "Oh cool."

23:17:00 Rogue Romano nods.

23:17:16 Rogue Romano asks, "I don remember. We ran out of probes on this ship yeah?"

23:17:26 Morris Corlew says, "4 left apparently."

23:17:31 Morris points to the probes button.

23:17:40 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

23:17:43 Rogue Romano says, "Oh, I see."

23:17:46 Rogue Romano nods.

23:17:50 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

23:18:17 Rogue Romano says, "Well, Ather seems awake, but sorta in a daydreamy state I guess."

23:18:27 Morris Corlew nods.

23:20:53 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:21:10 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

23:21:21 Morris Corlew lopes south.

23:23:08 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

23:25:13 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

23:25:25 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

23:25:25 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

23:25:39 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

23:25:49 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

23:26:20 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

23:26:20 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:26:28 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:26:30 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

23:26:31 Ather Jammoa asks, "Woo?"

23:26:40 Rogue Romano grins at Ather Jammoa.

23:26:45 Rogue Romano slinks south.

23:26:47 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

23:26:48 Ather Jammoa strides south.

23:26:56 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

23:28:53 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:29:08 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

23:29:13 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

23:31:56 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

23:34:52 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

23:36:57 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

23:37:29 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:37:30 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]

23:37:31 You see a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

23:37:31 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Command Ring; Navigation Mainframe]

23:37:31 You can go northeast, northwest, and down.

23:37:32 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Command Ring; Starboard]

23:37:32 You can go southwest and northwest.

23:37:33 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Control Room]

23:37:33 You see a gray leather captain's chair, a white leather sofa, a black storage locker, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images' here.
Melinda Michaels and Ather Jammoa are standing here. Rogue Romano is sitting on a white leather sofa.
You can go southeast, southwest, up, and out.

23:37:44 The planetary surveyor displays a comparison of spectrum analyses, searching for redshift or blueshift.

23:37:56 A brightly colored x-ray spectrograph is slowly filled in on a nearby screen.

23:37:58 Rogue Romano waves to you.

23:38:02 Melinda Michaels waves to you.

23:38:10 You wave.

23:38:12 You smile.

23:38:44 The planetary surveyor displays a comparison of spectrum analyses, searching for redshift or blueshift.

23:38:45 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:38:57 You hear the faint sounds of an external x-ray telescope shifting orientation.

23:39:06 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

23:39:42 Melinda Michaels ducks under the arm of Rogue Romano as she checks the rift drive controls.

23:39:42 Melinda Michaels quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 210.0, 88.0.

23:39:44 The planetary surveyor displays a comparison of spectrum analyses, searching for redshift or blueshift.

23:39:46 Melinda Michaels says, "There."

23:39:54 Melinda Michaels says, "Previous heading was working fine."

23:39:57 A brightly colored x-ray spectrograph is slowly filled in on a nearby screen.

23:39:58 Rogue Romano says, "Yup."

23:40:05 You grin.

23:40:16 Rogue Romano says, "And you got a boob shot."

23:40:19 Melinda Michaels grins.

23:40:23 Rogue Romano grins.

23:40:44 The planetary surveyor displays a handful of moving points of light which could be planets. Text alongside shows probable composition and mass.

23:40:56 You hear the faint sounds of an external x-ray telescope shifting orientation.

23:41:06 Melinda Michaels says, "Just over 800 light-years to go, I think."

23:41:16 You say, "Ah, ok."

23:41:44 The ship's surveying equipment has succeeded in finding two planets in this system.

23:41:48 You cheer.

23:41:56 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

23:41:57 Melinda Michaels says, "Not bad."

23:42:04 You grin.

23:44:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:44:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:44:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:44:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:44:54 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

23:44:57 Aisling the Fox presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

23:45:36 I don't understand that.

23:45:37 I don't understand that.

23:45:38 I don't understand that.

23:45:45 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

23:45:46 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

23:45:46 Cheri Lindbergh waves.

23:45:49 Cheri Lindbergh walks east.

23:45:51 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 3505-7804 I on close approach."

23:45:58 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the east.

23:46:01 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

23:46:04 Cheri Lindbergh walks south.

23:46:06 I don't see that here.

23:46:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:46:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:46:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:46:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:47:54 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 3505-7804 I on close approach received."

23:48:34 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

23:48:39 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 3505-7804 II on close approach."

23:50:33 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

23:50:54 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 3505-7804 II on close approach received."

23:51:06 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

23:51:16 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

23:51:16 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

23:51:17 The starship has left a unique area of space.

23:51:26 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

23:52:15 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

23:56:06 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

23:56:17 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

23:56:17 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "And I helped!"

23:56:21 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:56:21 Melinda Michaels grins.

23:56:33 Melinda Michaels says, "And I can't write directions correctly."

23:56:34 Nissi Valdaire switches a metallic purple swivel einrophone off.

23:56:35 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

23:56:37 Melinda Michaels giggles.

23:57:00 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

23:57:04 Rogue Romano says, "Oh, thinkin' bout the boobs again eh? Naughty Mel."

23:57:05 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

23:57:06 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

23:57:08 Melinda Michaels laughs at Rogue Romano.

23:57:10 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:57:20 Rogue Romano hugs Melinda Michaels.

23:57:26 Rogue Romano says, "I love givin' you shit."

23:57:34 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

23:57:37 Melinda says to Rogue, "Oh I know you do."

23:57:39 Melinda Michaels grins.

23:57:41 Rogue Romano grins.

23:57:45 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

23:57:50 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:58:01 Ather Jammoa says, "We are under the 1000 mark now."

23:58:11 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

23:58:31 Cheri Lindbergh says, "All is well."

23:58:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

23:58:49 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

23:58:49 Ather Jammoa strides south.

23:58:50 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo!"

23:58:54 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

23:58:59 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

23:59:00 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

23:59:09 Ather Jammoa says, "We are going to need to recharge though, woo."

23:59:15 Melinda Michaels nods.

23:59:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:59:39 Rogue Romano says, "Ather volunteers for solo shovelin' to charge ship."

23:59:45 Rogue Romano says, "Woo."

23:59:54 Ather Jammoa says, "I am grandest shoveler in all of the ship."
