00:47 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:47 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:47 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:47 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:47 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:47 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Rolukssica.

00:47 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a bla
01:36 ck rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, and an internal stun turret here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

03:01 ["Test" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go south, up, and out.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the five-person transverser "Celestial Siren", the six-person sentinel "The Ferocious Adhesive Duck", the one-person fighter "This Is A Fighter", and the one-person expediter "No Big Thing" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Fisher the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Dell the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.

A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an overstuffed gold engineer's chair, a violet armchair, an internal stun turret, a flashy rainbow colored silk hammock, and a comfortable deep tie-dye suede recliner here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

12:41 You peer north and see...

12:41 ["Al Nar" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an elegant turquoise captain's chair, two turquoise tweed recliner with rubies in the arms, an internal stun turret, three gleaming black security drones, an enormous aqua beanbag chair, Shayla the droid, two diamond-encrusted camouflage medical drones, Gabe the droid, and Joe the droid here.
You see Moiraine Yobi and Jessica Marin here.
You can go south and out.

12:41 Moiraine Yobi sashays in from the north.

12:41 Shayla the droid arrives behind Moiraine Yobi.

12:41 [General Communication] Jessica Marin transmits, "Last call. One spot for mods."

12:41 Moiraine Yobi presses a button, calling up the damage report.

12:41 You gently kiss Moiraine Yobi's cheek.

12:41 ["Al Nar" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
You see an overstuffed gold gunner's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest.

12:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:41 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:41 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:42 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

12:42 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

12:42 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

12:42 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

12:42 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

12:42 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

12:42 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:42 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

12:42 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

12:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:54 You peer northwest and see...

12:54 ["Al Nar" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed gold engineer's chair, a violet armchair, an internal stun turret, a flashy rainbow colored silk hammock, and a comfortable deep tie-dye suede recliner here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

12:54 ["Al Nar" Weapons Room 3]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

12:55 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

12:55 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

12:55 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

12:55 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:55 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

12:55 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a bla
13:35 ck rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the two-person asteroid hauler "Rockin Roll" and the one-person cargo hauler "Just Junk" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the one-person fighter "Space Case" landed here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Docking Bay.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

17:17 An instructional sign

17:17 To create a sculpture:
1. Buy clay
2. WORK clay
3. MOLD clay
You will need to choose the atributes of your sculpture while in the molding process. If you don't like the way your sculpture came out, just SQUISH it and start over!
If you're satisfied with your sculpture and wish to make it permanent:
1. Ensure that the kiln is HEATed. The door will need to be closed, and no clay present within the chamber.
2. Once the kiln finishes heating, open the door and place your sculpture in it.
3. Close the door and FIRE the kiln.
Once the kiln finishes firing your sculpture, it will become a masterpiece that can no longer be reworked. If you like your artwork, you can take it next door and SUBMIT it for sale to the public. Just remember, if you wish to do this, you need to SIGN your sculpture prior to firing or the store won't accept it.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

17:47 ["Al Nar" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed gold gunner's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest.

18:22 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

18:22 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

18:22 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

18:22 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

18:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:22 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:22 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:22 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:22 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:22 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

18:22 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:22 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

18:22 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:22 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

18:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:23 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:23 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

18:23 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:23 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

18:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

18:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:23 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:23 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and

This large room is jam-packed with tables full of machinery and crates of spare body parts leftover from some mad scientist's nefarious doings. Harsh white lights cast a blinding glare throughout the area, and the white walls and floor tiles reflect the light, brightening every square inch of the place. Strong-looking metal doors are set in intervals along the walls, and a constant stream of people can be seen coming and going through them. One of the tables has a hologram projector mounted above it, and when activated, images are shown on the table and can be manipulated for quality assurance.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
