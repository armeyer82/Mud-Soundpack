Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
a compact red refrigerator, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a red plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler,
and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
You can go south and out.

#help delay
Command: #delay {seconds} {command}
Command: #delay {name} {command} {seconds} 

         Delay allows you to have tintin wait the given amount of seconds
         before executing the given command. tintin won't wait before
         executing following input commands if any.

         Floating point precision for miliseconds is possible.

Example: #showme first;#delay {1} {#showme last}
         This will print 'first', and 'last' around one second later.

Comment: If you want to remove a delay with the #undelay command you can add
         a name as the first argument, be aware this changes the syntax.

#help prompt
Command: #prompt {text} {new text} {row #}

         Prompt is a feature for split window mode (see #help split), which
         will take the status prompt from the mud, and display it on the status
         line of the split window.  You would define <string> the same way you
         would a substitution (see #help substitute).  The row number is
         optional if you use a non standard split mode.  In which case a
         positive number draws #row lines above your cursor, and a negative
         number draws #row lines below your topline.

Comment: See '#help action', for more information about triggers.

Comment: You can remove a prompt with the #unprompt command.
#help history
Command: #history {delete}                 Delete the last command.
         #history {insert}    {command}    Insert a command.
         #history {list}                   Display the entire command history.
         #history {read}      {filename}   Read a command history from file.
         #history {write}     {filename}   Write a command history to file.

         Without an argument all available options are shown.
#history
############################### HISTORY COMMANDS ###############################
  [DELETE       ] Delete last command history entry.
  [INSERT       ] Insert a new command history entry.
  [LIST         ] Display command history list.
  [READ         ] Read a command history list from file.
  [WRITE        ] Write a command history list to file.
################################################################################
#help echo
Command: #echo {format} {argument1} {argument2} {etc}

         Echo command displays text on the screen with formatting options. See
         the help file for the format command for more informations.

         The echo command does not trigger actions.

         As with the #showme command you can split the {format} argument up into
         two braced arguments, in which case the 2nd argument is the row number.

Example: #echo {The current date is %t.} {%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}
         #echo {[%38s][%-38s]} {Hello World} {Hello World}
         #echo {{this is %s on the top row} {-1}} {printed}
#help showme
Command: #showme {string} {row}

         Display the string to the terminal, do not send to the mud.  Useful for
         status, warnings, etc.  The {row} number is optional and works the same
         way as the row number of the #prompt trigger.

         Actions can be triggered by the showme command.

Example: #action {%0 ultraslays you.}
           {#showme {###### ARGH! We were ultraslayed by %0 ######};#gagline}
         Emphasis ultraslaying.
#prompt

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
a compact red refrigerator, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a red plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler,
and Xavier the big silver soldier felo here.
You can go south and out.

#help class
Command: #class {name} {open|close|read filename|write filename|kill}

         The {open} option will open a class, closing a previously opened
         class. All triggers added afterwards are assigned to this class.
         The {close} option will close the given class.
         The {read} option will open the class, read, and close afterwards.
         The {write} option will write all triggers of the given class to file.
         The {kill} option will delete all triggers of the given class.

         Keep in mind that the kill and read option are very fast allowing
         them to be used to enable and disable classes.

Example: #class extra kill;#class extra read extra.tin
         Deletes all triggers of 'extra' class if any. Read 'extra.tin' file,
         all triggers loaded will be assigned to the fresh new 'extra' class.
