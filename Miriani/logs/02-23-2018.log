01:17 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here.
You can go south.

01:17 You gently caress Katrianne Beauchene.

02:29 ["Retaliation" Weapons Room 3] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable black leather combat chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. A tall black freestanding fan is emanating a cool breeze throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the black tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfortable black leather combat chair, a curvy glass lamp with black lava churning inside, a tall black freestanding fan, and a hologram of an animated rock band projected in the middle of the room here.
You can go west.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. A tall black freestanding fan is emanating a cool breeze throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the black tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

14:44 This is a rather grisly mission, but we feel it must be done. A number of the Praelor's biological starships have been detected. Your mission is to terminate these ships before they reach maturity and, consequently, full destructive potential. Current research suggests that, while these starships are biological in nature, they are not sentient, so destroying them should not be a problem. One potential problem you may encounter is that these starships are likely to flee from anything larger than a fighter. A squadron of fighters is recommended for this mission.

14:44 High Guard reconnaissance starships have detected a small fleet of Praelor travelling away from Praelor territory. While their intentions are unknown, analysis of their present course indicates that they're headed for a colony at the edge of alliance space. Your objective is to determine their intentions and, if hostile, destroy the fleet.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go south and out.

15:52 ["Barracuda" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

19:43 ["Unnatural Disaster" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. You see a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

21:22 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:22 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:22 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

21:47 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:47 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:48 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:48 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:48 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: You can also ask over the general or chat channels, witch were ment for those kinds of things.

21:48 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:50 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:50 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

22:08 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Subtle Resilience", the ten-person battlecruiser "Solidus", and the one-person cargo hauler "Bobgrab" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Mell the droid here.

22:08 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see a cozy bright red leather combat chair here.

22:27 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Subtle Resilience" and the one-person cargo hauler "Bobgrab" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Mell the droid here.

22:30 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see a cozy bright red leather combat chair here.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

22:31 ["Dark Bandis" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

22:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:33 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

22:33 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

22:33 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

22:33 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

22:33 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

22:33 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

22:34 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

22:34 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

22:34 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

22:34 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

22:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:48 [Newbie] Bob Gleason: How do I recharge my ship.

23:48 [Newbie] Renee Chance: Power it down.

23:48 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: Most spaceports will do it automatically when you land.

23:48 [Newbie] Bob Gleason: Then?

23:48 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: If you land on a landing pad, it should charge. Or, if you're landed at a properly-equipt spaceport, just power it off and on.

23:48 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: Uh, equipped.

23:49 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Mekensie the droid, and an all-occasions party robotic chef here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here.
You can go south.
