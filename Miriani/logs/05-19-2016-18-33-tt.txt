Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy dark
violet ceramic felo chow bowl, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and
a glass-covered top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a
pair of light brown leather boots decorated with silver stars here.
You can go out.

soldier kitten."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "That's new."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Though the albino are
adorible!"
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "I was wondering if eventually
I can breed them, and if that's the case, may I have one free felo that's
healthy and not onyx?"
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "I'm considering giving the
lames ones I have a new home... but I kind of don't want to part with them...
Though I think the sanctuary would ultimately be a better place for them."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Sure. I've got plenty."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They do it like mad, and all I
have a black."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Keep in mind that they take
your credits."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "I have one for breeding, and
my stalwart and corvette since once I get tracers for them, those two will also
be my bari hunting ships."
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "That's great! I will meet you
at manhattan then lillian, and I will be only taking care of two or so for now."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "Well the thing is they breed
quite fast if you let them."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "I'm aboard my mule at the
spaceport. Give me a shout when you're on the pad and I'll let you in."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Man, almost all mine have
gone black."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Like, "they can fill a ship in a
week" fast."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "Yeah well I've got a felo nest
in allmost all of my rooms."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "My mule at least."
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "At least you will be protected
from bari."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Huh, a dark albino. Never
seen something like this before."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "That is true. Even though I'm
not really a bari hunter especially since I don't really know where to look for
them."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Trading.
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Tepower."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They sorta find you."
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Miscom erm sorry."
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Here."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "I'm not too sure how you can
have a dark albino that. Doesn't make sense, but then again they're felo.
Although a glowing albino felo would be epicly cute."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Used to be there was a
breeding ground for bari, but the spreaders took off and we've got no idea where
they went. They show up from time to time."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "What would that even look
like?"
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Moment."
[General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "I'll be n the lounge."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
