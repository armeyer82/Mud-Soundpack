jumped out but I got the ares."

[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We've never actually managed

which has at least helped me form theories. I don't really know about anyone
else."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Makes sense."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I hadn't noticed prior to
this that they're transports. With an LRL...but transports regardless."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suspect that it might
operate as both a support ship and an obsrevationv essel which analyzes our
tactics, while employing something that might help the other combat-focused
vessels hit us harder. I've certainly noted an increase in the hits on my hull
when getting hit by a researcher's weird crackly weapon and then by other IFS
vessels."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, I noticed that crackly
thing too."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Everyone notices the crackly
thing, jus tno one really knows what it does."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I took more damage this time
out there, but I was up against two ships and not one, so kinda figured it was
that. But that weird crackling thing is after the hit."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I noticed after getting hit
it did about 50 percent damage to a turret on a transport. I don't remember the
lrl's hitting quite that hard."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They don't."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I messed up the other day and
didn't move out of a lock and actually got hit by a torp. I did not know IFS
used torps. At all."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did some decent damage too."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh well, maybe the Accord's
brainiacs can tell us something about them some day. Yes, IFS use torpedos. They
use my favorite weapon layout; lasers and torpedos."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've just never been hit with
one against IFS before. But I was trying to check on repairs and was alone in
the corvette so didn't get my hands on the controls fast enough to move."
