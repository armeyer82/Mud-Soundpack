00:26 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

05:47 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light

05:47 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

05:47 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Muzano the droid, Ralf the droid, Rika the droid, Aria the droid, a glossy red security drone, a glossy green security drone, a slim violet security drone, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Klever the droid, Puff the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Ponyo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

05:47 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

05:47 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

05:47 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

05:47 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

05:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

05:47 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

05:48 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

05:48 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

05:48 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

05:48 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

05:48 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

05:48 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

05:48 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:48 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:48 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:48 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:48 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

05:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

05:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:48 You are carrying a droid remote titled "Jenaia" in your left hand and a droid remote titled "Empanda" in your right hand.

05:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

05:48 You put a droid remote titled "Jenaia" in a black leather briefcase.

05:48 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

05:48 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

20:55 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

You can go south and out.

21:58 Jenaia the droid

21:58 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a red keychain with "beer lover for life" printed on it.
She is carrying nothing.

21:58 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

21:58 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

21:58 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

21:58 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

21:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:58 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:58 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:58 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:58 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The seven-person expeditioner "Raven" has left the sector.

21:58 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:58 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

21:58 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:58 The ship must be in space to do that.

21:58 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:59 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

21:59 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:58 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:59 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:59 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:59 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:59 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

21:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

21:59 The seven-person expeditioner "Raven" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

21:59 The computer reports the seven-person expeditioner "Raven" is one unit away from this ship.

21:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

21:59 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:59 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

21:59 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Delta it is."

21:59 You must stand up first.

22:05 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

22:05 You peer northwest and see...

22:05 ["Tides of Destiny" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. A tall wide metal deep turquoise lamp is casting a warm gold light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a life-sized clay sculpture of a fire kitsune, a tall wide metal deep turquoise lamp, and a high baby purple velvet co-captain's chair here.
You see Calyssa Calaway and Dorion Hunter here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
