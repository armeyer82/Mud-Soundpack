Extended Emotes
--------------------------------------------------
Extended emotes are a system that allows one to directly reference objects or other players in the world itself for a much greater sense of flexibility in the midst of roleplay. There are also a myriad of other features, which are detailed below:

* Replaces with your name. If there is no * in your emote, your name is automatically tacked on to the beginning.
*1 Replaces with your first name.
*2 Replaces with your last name.

-thing Matches to an object in the room. There is no space between the dash and the name. If you only want to use a player's first name, just stick a 1 after their name. If you capitalize your match string, it will appropriately capitalize the matching object. Examples:
    -albori1 would be replaced by "Albori"
    -toast would be replaced by "a slice of toast" if there is a slice of toast in the room
    -Toast would be replaced by "A slice of toast" if there is a slice of toast in the room.
~thing Functions in much the same way as - except it will strip 'a' or 'an' off the beginning of an object's name.
 It's worth noting that you cannot use another player as the very first item in an emote. Allowing this would create confusion when people thought that the player you were referencing was performing an action that they were not. For example: "-merugle gives * an enthusiastic high-five!" Using -merugle as the first word would not work because it would look like a standard emote from Merugle.

%he / %himself / %his / %him - Replaces with the appropriate word for the appropriate person. If you reference multiple objects or people (using dash thing, as described above), you can specify who you're talking about by adding a number after the %his. So for example, if I say: "-albori twirled -merugle, who pushed -lazurus, who ate a sandwich." you would refer to Albori with %he, Merugle with %she2 (or %he2, it doesn't matter), and Lazurus with %he3.

If you capitalize %he, %himself, %his, %him, etc, it will appropriately capitalize the replacement. Example:
    shakes -fred. %He2 is shaken.
becomes...
    Albori Isahost Sninvel shakes Fred Quantultoniel McElk. He is shaken.

* NOTE * Because of ambiguity issues, you should always use %him or %his instead of %her. Sorry ladies! (Don't worry, it'll get the right gender no matter which one you use.)

%{list} will allow you to randomize a very basic list of words. Spaces won't work (for the time being) anywhere between the {}'s, so it is an extremely crude facility for randomization. But it should suffice for now.
Example: %{a,list,of,words,goes,here}

Additionally, you can save your extended emotes for later by creating custom socials. Simply type @custom-socials and follow the prompts to store emotive strings as custom commands for easy access.

It's also possible to pipe a command throug
00:59 h with your extended emote, effectively allowing you to override the standard output of that command. For example, if you want to stand up in a spectacular fashion, you can override the stand command. To do so, you simply add a pipe character ('|') to the end of your text and then the command you want to execute. For example:

  *'s eyes widen in shock. He wobbles unsteadily before collapsing to the ground at -fred's feet. | collapse fred
  Albori Vanishing Point Sninvel's eyes widen in shock. He wobbles unsteadily before collapsing to the ground at Fred Quantultoniel McElk's feet.


A full list of commands can be found by typing 'emote pipes'. If you combine command piping with @custom-socials, the output of your commands will no longer be visible to you with your new emote. In the above example, you would no longer see yourself collapsing at Fred's feet, as the social took over that output.

For players who don't like the command piping system, you can enable a ROOM-OPTION to always show the output of standard commands regardless of what social a player used.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it li
01:00 ke any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

Communicators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Communicators are the basis for most communication in Miriani. Anyone with a communicator can talk to anyone else with a communicator, communicate privately with their alliance, or privately with their friends. They can be slightly complicated, however, so this guide aims to familiarize you with all of their functions!

  Transmission basics:
When you begin playing Miriani, you are given a receiver-only communicator. You will almost certainly want to replace it with a fully functional communicator. For instructions on doing this, please type HELP FAQ or HELP GETTING-STARTED. This document deals with operating your communicator, not obtaining one. You should replace anything in <less-than and greater-than> signs with your own text, not including the signs.

The most useful channel is the General Communication channel. Everyone in all three alliances has access to that one, making it extremely useful for discussing issues directly related to starship piloting. To transmit on it, you can type TRANSMIT GENERAL <MESSAGE>. This can be shortened to TRANS GEN or TR G for speed. There are some conditions associated with using this channel, so please read HELP COMMUNICATOR RULES before using it.

The second most commonly-used channel is the chatter channel. Everyone in the three alliances has access to this channel, making it very good for everyday chatter. To transmit on it, you can type TRANSMIT CHATTER <MESSAGE>. This can be shortened to TRANS CHAT or TR C for speed.

The third most commonly-used channel is the first private alliance channel. This channel allows you to communicate with members of only your own alliance, other people can't hear it. You can transmit on this channel using TRANSMIT 1 <MESSAGE>. As before, this can be shortened to TRANS 1 or TR 1.

But wait, there's more! You have a whole other nine alliance channels to transmit on! TR 2 will transmit on your alliance's trading channel. Channel 3 is your alliance's distress channel, and 4 is the exploration channel. Channels 5-10 are just regular old, numbered channels. To see a semi-complete list of channels you can access, type TR CHANNELS.

There's also an interalliance channel, which only exists when your alliance is at a full alliance treaty with another. If you have this nifty old alliance, you can type TR ALLIANCE <MESSAGE> or TR INT <MESSAGE>.

Just when you thought you could communicate no more, there is another channel for you to utilize, known as the short-range channel. When you type TRANSMIT SHORT-RANGE <MESSAGE> (or TR SHORT), your communicator will switch into short-range mode and transmit a message to any other communicator in the sector. This is valuable for those trips out of communications range where communicating is vital but not possible using standard beacons.

  Transmission tuning:
To save time, you can tune your communicator to transmit on one channel by default when you type TRANSMIT <MESSAGE>. By typing TRANSMIT TUNE <CHANNEL>, you will tune your communicator to that channel. Please be aware that you will NOT hear any other channels but that one and General Communication while your communicator is tuned! You can reset it to listen to all channels by typing TRANSMIT TUNE ALL.

  Private linked channels:
If you need a private way to communicate with friends or business partners, you can establish a private linked channel with them! Nobody else can see what you say on a linked channel, so you can be assured total privacy. There are several commands for dealing with linked channels, which will be listed when an explanation of each one following:
TRANSMIT LINKED [person] - If you don't include [person], this command will give you a list of everyone you have established a link with. If you do include a person's name, it will check to see if you have a private link with that person or not.
TRANSMIT LINKCOUNT - This tells you how many private links you have.
TRANSMIT LINK <PERSON> - This command will ask the target person if they would like to establish a link with you. If they accept, you will be linked.
TRANSMIT UNLINK <PERSON> (or DELINK) - This command will break the link with the target person.
TRANSMIT UNLINK ALL - This will terminate all of your private links.
TRANSMIT <PERSON> <MESSAGE> - This command will transmit a message over the private link with the target person, as long as you have established a link with them.
TRANSMIT HISTORY - Displays the last few messages transmitted over the general communications channel.
REPLY <message> - This command will send <message> to the last person who sent you a private transmission.
REPLYLOCK <person|off> - This command will lock your replies to a single individual. If you type REPLYLOCK OFF, it will go back to responding to the last person to send you a transmission. Typing REPLYLOCK with no arguments will tell you which mode you're currently in.
TRANSMIT HARDLINK <PERSON> - Establishes a matching alias that you can use for <PERSON>. This alias serves the dual purpose of becoming a command that you can type to quickly communicate with the person you're hardlinked with. For example, if you hardlink 'pal' to Joe Schmoe, from then on you can either type 'PAL HELLO!' or 'TR PAL HELLO!' to communicate with him.
TRANSMIT HARDLINK REMOVE - Remove a hardlink.

  Muting Channels:
TURN COMM - Deactivates your communicator, preventing sending/receiving.
MUTE COMM - Presents a menu of channels that can be muted.
UNMUTE COMM - The opposite of MUTE, this presents a menu of channels that can be unmuted.

  NOTE: If you disable the general communication channel, you may miss out on special host-run roleplaying events.

  Metafrequency Transmitters
There are also seperate communicators that you can buy called Metafrequency Transmitters. These are useful for talking to a small group of people. You can TUNE META TO <number from 1.0 to 500.0>. So for example, you could tune your communicator to the frequency 45.21 and then tell all your friends to tune to that channel too, and you can then all chat together without having to have everyone hear. However, there's always the chance, though small, that someone else can be on your frequency. You can transmit by typing USE META WITH [message].

Alternatively, you can use the command METAF [message]. If you have multiple metafrequency communicators, you can add a number after the command to specify which to use. For example, to speak into the second communicator you're wearing, you could type: METAF 2 HELLO WORLD.

There is also an experimental option available that will allow you to set an alias to use as a command for a particular channel. To activate this functionality, first type COMM-OPTIONS and select option 13 (Attempt to match unknown commands to metafrequency labels (WARNING: May cause lag. Who knows!)). Now, tune your metafrequency communicator to the channel you wish to alias and type LABEL <metafrequency communicator>. If you wish to assign more labels, tune your transmitter again and repeat the procedure. The label you assign will be the command that you type to communicate on that channel (assuming your transmitter is tuned to that channel). So for example, if you TUNE METAF TO 500, LABEL METAF, and type OOC, you can now type OOC <message> to speak on that channel.

Commands for experimental labels:
  LABEL <comm> - Assigns a label to the frequency the transmitter is tuned to. After you add a label, you can use that label as a command to transmit on the frequency. You can also use that label to match to your communicator. For example, if you label channel 500 'OOC', you can type 'OOC Hello!' to transmit hello and you can type "look ooc" to look at the communicator.
  UNLABEL <comm> - Removes a label.

Speaking of channel 500 (the unofficial OOC channel), you can view the complete history of all transmissions on that channel for the day at: http://toastsoft.net:1111/ooc_history/

  Ignoring People
Should you wish to ignore specific people, there is a selective hearing feature implemented. This is akin to your character plugging his or her ears while somebody is speaking and unplugging them when the transmissions ends.

IGNORE <name of person> - Adds or removes a person to/from your ignore list.
IGNORING - Displays a list of people you're ignoring.

  Emoting
Sometimes you want to laugh or cry. We have you covered. The following emotes are covered as a single message: laughs, giggles, chortles, snickers, cries, sobs, mumbles, coughs, snorts, groans, yawn, sigh, chuckel, cackle, laugh, begawk, moan, whisper, and sing.

01:03 
However, sometimes you may want to laugh AND say something. To do this, just add asterisks (*) around your emote of choice and put it at the end of your transmission. This works with: laughs, giggles, chortles, snickers, cries, sobs, mumbles, coughs, snorts, groans, yawns, sighs, and chuckles. Example: *laughs*

Examples:
  TR CHAT *laughs*  (This becomes: [Chatter] Albori laughs.)
  TR CHAT I dropped my taco! *cries* (This becomes: [Chatter] Albori transmits through tears, "I dropped my taco!")

  Starship Relay Channel
Some starships possess a relay channel upgrade which allows them to relay communicator signals among a select group of individuals. The following commands apply to ship relay channels:

  CHANNEL - In the starship control room, this allows the ship owner to enable/disable the relay, authorize a communicator, or deauthorize a communicator.
  TR SHIP [message] - Transmits [message] to the ship relay channel if you're authorized.
  TR SHIP UNLINK - Unlinks your communicator from the ship relay channel.


This covers communicators! If you have any further questions, you are more than welcome to type ASSIST to request personal assistance from a staff member.

01:36 ["Palace of Shadow" Weapons Room 3] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret and a comfortable red beanbag chair here.
You can go west.

01:37 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:37 You sit down on a comfortable red beanbag chair.

01:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:37 Calyssa Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok... here we go. if you stare on these missions like my last crew i'll be upset"

01:37 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:37 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "i'll stare"

01:37 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:37 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Nope, not planning on staring. Not even at a cute girl."

01:38 You press a small button mounted on the wall and chuckle.

01:38 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:38 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:38 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

01:38 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:38 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:38 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:38 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:38 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:38 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:38 Amy Draksen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I am beyond overly joyed at the moment. In fact, I am so full of mirth that giddiness itself is jealous."

01:38 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:44 ["Tales of Symphonia" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a large tapestry with an enormous dragon mid-flight breathing fire down on a village embroidered on it hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

02:44 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:44 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:44 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:45 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:19 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:19 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

12:19 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:19 You peer out and see...

12:19 [51 Pegasi b; Balloonzia Circle Landing Pad]
This large circular landing pad is marked off by a low wooden fence. Tied to it are what look to be at least a hundred balloons bobbing in the wind, all in a profusion of bright colors. Fanciful balloon patterns have been chalked onto the cement surface of the landing pad itself. Two wide paved roads lead off from the landing site, curving away out of sight between large shady trees.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a giant balloon shaped chair, a chair hastily crafted out of nearby sponges, a Sponge Inc spongecan, Why the droid, Coocoo the droid, and Rang the droid here.
You can go north and southwest.

12:19 You begin the launch sequence.

12:19 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:19 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:19 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:19 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:19 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

12:19 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:19 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:19 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:19 The computer announces, "Four planets have been detected in the sector."

12:19 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:19 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 3, 5."

12:19 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:19 Sector 18: Omnivincere (Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists)

Current Coordinates: (9, 18, 10)

12:19 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:19 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:19 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:19 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:19 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:20 You must stand up first.

12:20 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

Communicators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Communicators are the basis for most communication in Miriani. Anyone with a communicator can talk to anyone else with a communicator, communicate privately with their alliance, or privately with their friends. They can be slightly complicated, however, so this guide aims to familiarize you with all of their functions!

  Transmission basics:
When you begin playing Miriani, you are given a receiver-only communicator. You will almost certainly want to replace it with a fully functional communicator. For instructions on doing this, please type HELP FAQ or HELP GETTING-STARTED. This document deals with operating your communicator, not obtaining one. You should replace anything in <less-than and greater-than> signs with your own text, not including the signs.

The most useful channel is the General Communication channel. Everyone in all three alliances has access to that one, making it extremely useful for discussing issues directly related to starship piloting. To transmit on it, you can type TRANSMIT GENERAL <MESSAGE>. This can be shortened to TRANS GEN or TR G for speed. There are some conditions associated with using this channel, so please read HELP COMMUNICATOR RULES before using it.

The second most commonly-used channel is the chatter channel. Everyone in the three alliances has access to this channel, making it very good for everyday chatter. To transmit on it, you can type TRANSMIT CHATTER <MESSAGE>. This can be shortened to TRANS CHAT or TR C for speed.

The third most commonly-used channel is the first private alliance channel. This channel allows you to communicate with members of only your own alliance, other people can't hear it. You can transmit on this channel using TRANSMIT 1 <MESSAGE>. As before, this can be shortened to TRANS 1 or TR 1.

But wait, there's more! You have a whole other nine alliance channels to transmit on! TR 2 will transmit on your alliance's trading channel. Channel 3 is your alliance's distress channel, and 4 is the exploration channel. Channels 5-10 are just regular old, numbered channels. To see a semi-complete list of channels you can access, type TR CHANNELS.

There's also an interalliance channel, which only exists when your alliance is at a full alliance treaty with another. If you have this nifty old alliance, you can type TR ALLIANCE <MESSAGE> or TR INT <MESSAGE>.

Just when you thought you could communicate no more, there is another channel for you to utilize, known as the short-range channel. When you type TRANSMIT SHORT-RANGE <MESSAGE> (or TR SHORT), your communicator will switch into short-range mode and transmit a message to any other communicator in the sector. This is valuable for those trips out of communications range where communicating is vital but not possible using standard beacons.

  Transmission tuning:
To save time, you can tune your communicator to transmit on one channel by default when you type TRANSMIT <MESSAGE>. By typing TRANSMIT TUNE <CHANNEL>, you will tune your communicator to that channel. Please be aware that you will NOT hear any other channels but that one and General Communication while your communicator is tuned! You can reset it to listen to all channels by typing TRANSMIT TUNE ALL.

  Private linked channels:
If you need a private way to communicate with friends or business partners, you can establish a private linked channel with them! Nobody else can see what you say on a linked channel, so you can be assured total privacy. There are several commands for dealing with linked channels, which will be listed when an explanation of each one following:
TRANSMIT LINKED [person] - If you don't include [person], this command will give you a list of everyone you have established a link with. If you do include a person's name, it will check to see if you have a private link with that person or not.
TRANSMIT LINKCOUNT - This tells you how many private links you have.
TRANSMIT LINK <PERSON> - This command will ask the target person if they would like to establish a link with you. If they accept, you will be linked.
TRANSMIT UNLINK <PERSON> (or DELINK) - This command will break the link with the target person.
TRANSMIT UNLINK ALL - This will terminate all of your private links.
TRANSMIT <PERSON> <MESSAGE> - This command will transmit a message over the private link with the target person, as long as you have established a link with them.
TRANSMIT HISTORY - Displays the last few messages transmitted over the general communications channel.
REPLY <message> - This command will send <message> to the last person who sent you a private transmission.
REPLYLOCK <person|off> - This command will lock your replies to a single individual. If you type REPLYLOCK OFF, it will go back to responding to the last person to send you a transmission. Typing REPLYLOCK with no arguments will tell you which mode you're currently in.
TRANSMIT HARDLINK <PERSON> - Establishes a matching alias that you can use for <PERSON>. This alias serves the dual purpose of becoming a command that you can type to quickly communicate with the person you're hardlinked with. For example, if you hardlink 'pal' to Joe Schmoe, from then on you can either type 'PAL HELLO!' or 'TR PAL HELLO!' to communicate with him.
TRANSMIT HARDLINK REMOVE - Remove a hardlink.

  Muting Channels:
TURN COMM - Deactivates your communicator, preventing sending/receiving.
MUTE COMM - Presents a menu of channels that can be muted.
UNMUTE COMM - The opposite of MUTE, this presents a menu of channels that can be unmuted.

  NOTE: If you disable the general communication channel, you may miss out on special host-run roleplaying events.

  Metafrequency Transmitters
There are also seperate communicators that you can buy called Metafrequency Transmitters. These are useful for talking to a small group of people. You can TUNE META TO <number from 1.0 to 500.0>. So for example, you could tune your communicator to the frequency 45.21 and then tell all your friends to tune to that channel too, and you can then all chat together without having to have everyone hear. However, there's always the chance, though small, that someone else can be on your frequency. You can transmit by typing USE META WITH [message].

Alternatively, you can use the command METAF [message]. If you have multiple metafrequency communicators, you can add a number after the command to specify which to use. For example, to speak into the second communicator you're wearing, you could type: METAF 2 HELLO WORLD.

There is also an experimental option available that will allow you to set an alias to use as a command for a particular channel. To activate this functionality, first type COMM-OPTIONS and select option 13 (Attempt to match unknown commands to metafrequency labels (WARNING: May cause lag. Who knows!)). Now, tune your metafrequency communicator to the channel you wish to alias and type LABEL <metafrequency communicator>. If you wish to assign more labels, tune your transmitter again and repeat the procedure. The label you assign will be the command that you type to communicate on that channel (assuming your transmitter is tuned to that channel). So for example, if you TUNE METAF TO 500, LABEL METAF, and type OOC, you can now type OOC <message> to speak on that channel.

Commands for experimental labels:
  LABEL <comm> - Assigns a label to the frequency the transmitter is tuned to. After you add a label, you can use that label as a command to transmit on the frequency. You can also use that label to match to your communicator. For example, if you label channel 500 'OOC', you can type 'OOC Hello!' to transmit hello and you can type "look ooc" to look at the communicator.
  UNLABEL <comm> - Removes a label.

Speaking of channel 500 (the unofficial OOC channel), you can view the complete history of all transmissions on that channel for the day at: http://toastsoft.net:1111/ooc_history/

  Ignoring People
Should you wish to ignore specific people, there is a selective hearing feature implemented. This is akin to your character plugging his or her ears while somebody is speaking and unplugging them when the transmissions ends.

IGNORE <name of person> - Adds or removes a person to/from your ignore list.
IGNORING - Displays a list of people you're ignoring.

  Emoting
Sometimes you want to laugh or cry. We have you covered. The following emotes are covered as a single message: laughs, giggles, chortles, snickers, cries, sobs, mumbles, coughs, snorts, groans, yawn, sigh, chuckel, cackle, laugh, begawk, moan, whisper, and sing.

14:12 
However, sometimes you may want to laugh AND say something. To do this, just add asterisks (*) around your emote of choice and put it at the end of your transmission. This works with: laughs, giggles, chortles, snickers, cries, sobs, mumbles, coughs, snorts, groans, yawns, sighs, and chuckles. Example: *laughs*

Examples:
  TR CHAT *laughs*  (This becomes: [Chatter] Albori laughs.)
  TR CHAT I dropped my taco! *cries* (This becomes: [Chatter] Albori transmits through tears, "I dropped my taco!")

  Starship Relay Channel
Some starships possess a relay channel upgrade which allows them to relay communicator signals among a select group of individuals. The following commands apply to ship relay channels:

  CHANNEL - In the starship control room, this allows the ship owner to enable/disable the relay, authorize a communicator, or deauthorize a communicator.
  TR SHIP [message] - Transmits [message] to the ship relay channel if you're authorized.
  TR SHIP UNLINK - Unlinks your communicator from the ship relay channel.


This covers communicators! If you have any further questions, you are more than welcome to type ASSIST to request personal assistance from a staff member.

15:34 ["Flames of Rage" Weapons Room 4] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy royal blue leather combat chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a comfy royal blue leather combat chair here.
You can go northwest.

15:34 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

15:34 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

15:34 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

15:35 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

15:35 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:35 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:35 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:36 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:36 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:36 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:36 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:36 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:36 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:36 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:36 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:36 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:17 [Private | Matt Valentino] You transmit, "So any tips on how to solo combat in a transverser? Multirooming is a bit of a challenge."

16:21 [AIE | Exploration] Jason Harkness transmits, "It has more charge, which makes it ideal for taking out combinations."

16:21 [AIE | Exploration] Cara West transmits, "Cuz I've heard people prefer tranny and runabout verses tranny with fighter docked and I was curious why."

16:21 [AIE | Exploration] Cara West transmits, "Thanks jason."

16:21 [AIE | Exploration] Jason Harkness transmits, "Do both."

16:22 [AIE | Exploration] Bert Edson transmits, "How would one prevent the combinations from beating up the mothership if there's no one there to fly it?"

16:22 [Private | Matt Valentino] You transmit, "I just don't like taking my transverser out of locals by myself or unless I have at least one other person."

16:23 [AIE | Exploration] Matt Valentino transmits, "I'm considering building spaceports throughout uncharted space for pilots to land with their specialty ships to collect supplies and charge. What are some sectors that you all like flying out of? I was thinking about putting them out of 32 or 13 every five hundred lightyears or so."

16:23 [AIE | Exploration] Cara West transmits, "If I run into a muz, I launch fighter, put tranny at 1 1 1, then shoot muz with fighter. A muz and onati. Though."

17:07 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go south and out.

17:07 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

17:07 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

17:07 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:07 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:07 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

17:07 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

17:07 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

17:07 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:07 There are no ships here.

17:07 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:07 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:07 The starship must be in space.

17:07 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

17:07 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:08 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:08 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

17:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

17:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:08 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

17:08 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
