["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent
00:19  red security drones, an internal stun turret, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.

00:30 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:30 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

00:30 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

00:30 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

00:30 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:30 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

00:30 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:31 The ship is already moving.

00:31 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:31 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:31 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:31 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:31 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:31 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:31 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 6, 5."

00:31 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:31 Sector 1: Satus (Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists)

00:31 Galactic Coordinates: (-603080, 1, 420)

00:31 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:31 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:31 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels orient themselves toward a star.

00:31 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You notify flight control of your desire to land.

00:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

00:31 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

00:31 You stand up.

00:31 You peer out and see...

00:31 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the four-person roborant "Enchanted Chaos" landed here.
You see a sparking airlock, Yawn the droid, Mer the droid, Alphy the droid, Lose the droid, and Miracle the droid here.

00:31 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

00:31 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Beginning cycling."

00:31 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of black jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a red communicator, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a masculine gold classic wedding band, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a softly padded black snuggly, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a soft white cloth diaper bag patterned with dolphins, a black stun armor storage bag, a level six archaeological dig site scanner, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.
You are carrying a small shovel in your left hand.

00:31 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard exiting the airlock.

00:31 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

02:08 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:08 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:08 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:22 Olivia Cantrell's voice comes over the intercom, laughing and saying, "Oliva?"

02:22 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

02:22 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:22 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Sorry, I can't talk today."

02:22 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I meant, Oilivia."

02:22 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:22 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:23 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:23 Ivan Cardenas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "that she is"

02:23 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:23 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:23 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:23 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:23 Olivia Cantrell's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "awww thank you"

02:23 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:23 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:23 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I am not going to comment and make my life forfeit."

02:23 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:23 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:23 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:23 Ali Cardenas laughs over the intercom.

02:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:40 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two starships and two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:40 Select a ship:

02:40 [1] the three-person antagonizer "Vae Victis"
[2] the eight-person gunship "Praelor Demolish Enterprize"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:40 Invalid selection.

02:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:40 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

02:40 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

02:40 The eight-person gunship "Praelor Demolish Enterprize" has left the sector.

02:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:40 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:40 Current coordinates: 9, 8, 15

02:40 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:40 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

02:40 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:40 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

02:40 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:40 Current coordinates: 9, 8, 1

02:40 There are no ships here.

02:40 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

02:40 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:40 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

02:40 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

02:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:41 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:41 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:41 You can't power down the starship in space.

02:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:41 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:41 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

23:34 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

23:34 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:34 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:34 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:34 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:34 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:34 The ship must be in space to do that.

The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:34 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

23:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:34 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

23:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:34 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

A gentle computerized voice announces, "The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

23:34 You peer out and see...

23:34 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the four-person surveyor "Ools Storage" powered down here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Ooey Gooey Butter Cake You're So Addictive", the ten-person battlecruiser "The Cat's Meow", the six-person destroyer "Magical Melody", the ten-person battlecruiser "Valkyrie", and the two-person vanguard "Gladius" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.
