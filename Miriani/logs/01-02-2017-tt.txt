A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new

Lily Kaise just entered the ship.
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oops."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
You nod.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock
Four).

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

camera bag, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a golden
Feng Wo coin purse, a black engineering tool case, a scorched metal thigh
holster, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a large expandable
telescoping xenology container, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large
pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Angel's Flight" and the five-person
A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.

Lily Kaise is standing here.

You can't go that way.
Several AEU policemen in uniform rush out of a police squad vehicle. One of them
yells, "You! Shule Elemmire! You're under arrest."
You are handcuffed and led to the police squad vehicle. You hear someone reading
you your rights as a policeman opens the door and ushers you in, none too
gently.
[AEU Police Squad Vehicle]
You can go nowhere.
You step into the vehicle and are seated on a hard bench across from two
officers. They stare at you in silence.
You are strapped in to your seat by one of the policemen as you begin to feel
the vehicle take off.
You hear the sounds normally associated with an FTL jump as the vehicle jumps to
Dure Orbit, the location of the prison.
The vehicle leaves the wormhole, and begins to move rapidly toward the moon. The
pilots chatter back and forth with ground control.
The vehicle maintains a steady speed until it nears the moon. You are slowly
pressed into the restraints as it begins to decelerate.
02:00:00
You feel a mild vibration as the vehicle enters the moon's thin atmosphere,
extends its wings, and fires its thrusters.
The vehicle comes in for a relatively smooth landing. The policemen unstrap you
and help you stand up, opening the door and escorting you out.
You are escorted off of the craft, your arms held tightly by the officers.
[Dure; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The one-person cargo hauler "Hypnotic Mesmerize" is landed here.
You see AEU Police Squad Vehicle here.
You can go north, northeast, east, south, and west.
The hatch closes and the vehicle takes off again.
You are escorted to the prison gate, your arms held tightly by the officers.

You can go east.
You are escorted down the prison driveway, your arms held tightly by the
officers.
[Corbin Memorial Prison; Drive]
You can go north and out.
You are escorted into the prison building.
[Corbin Memorial Prison; Front Desk]
You see a well-dressed secretary, a deep green and silver payphone, a trash can,
a basic white spacesuit bottom, a white flightbag, a message board reader, an I
SLEEP IN PUBLIC PLACES stamp, a stamp of the words Eric Best is my hero, and a
simple cardboard box labeled 'Maxem, Zac' here.
You can go south and down.
A clerk glances at you, then asks the policeman at your side for your file. He
says, "Ah... Shule Elemmire. Yes, let's see. You have been arrested on the
charge of Public Indecency. Your sentence is 15 minutes of confinement."
The clerk begins tapping something into a large teletype console.
The clerk continues, "All right, your prisoner identification number is
651025493. Please place all of your belongings into this box. You will recieve a
set of standard-issue clothing after going through standard delousing
procedures. Your personal effects will be returned to you once you leave."
You begin stripping down and placing your belongings into a simple cardboard box
labeled 'Elemmire, Shule'. The effect overall is rather dehumanizing.
The police officer escorts you to the delousing chamber, and multiple nozzles
spray a sickly sweet smelling chemical onto you.
You're escorted out and given a set of mildly unflattering prison garb, which
you quickly don.
You slide a pair of prison-issue synthcotton briefs on.
You step into an orange prison-issue jumpsuit and pull it over your arms.
A police officer roughly grabs your arm and pushes you in the direction of one
of the cells. He says dryly, "Have a nice stay at the Hotel Corbin."
The cop gives you one last shove, right into the cell.
[Prison Cell]
You see a small stainless steel toilet, a small transparisteel mirror bolted
securely above the toilet, and a narrow bunk here.
The cell door is open. You may go out.

stick out in a row from either side wall, and large drains are in a line along
the center of the floor. Each shower head has only a button to activate it, with
no temperature control. A small camera is conspicuously placed in a back corner,
behind a moisture shield. A plastic sign reads in block letters, "SHOWERS ACTIVE

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small purple
trash bin, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and
red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the
humanoid service robot here.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
