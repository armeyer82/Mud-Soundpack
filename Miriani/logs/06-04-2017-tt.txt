Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small
purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a purple
jeweled leash here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, I would like to take a moment to
welcome Tolorek Solo, Neil Graham, Jessica Hills and Karl Brjolnif to the pilot
corps. I hope you will all have a fruitful time where you reach your goals and
learn something along the way. That concludes my report, fly safe everyone! Kim
Saunders. [08:34  2 June 2317 GST]
2,516,438.41 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00 
3 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots: as of this comm notice,
all AEU sectors appear to be clear of all threats, Bari and otherwise. However,
remember to keep your ships powered down and garaged wherever possible. I also
encourage you all to read Aisling's post on general/general, and to avoid
targeting Allied pirate starships in any Mutuality sector. If you're unsure
whether a sector belongs to them, check your starmap. That's one of the things
it's for. Lastly, I will be leaving on a bit of a jaunt on Monday. To those who
I have promised to give lessons to, you will be receiving letters from me
tonight scheduling at least one lesson before departure time. I hope you can
make it! In the meantime, if anyone has any questions before I leave, you have
until Monday to either mail me, or to call the SDC office. [03:31  3 June 2317
GST]
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots: as of this comm notice,
AEU space continues to be clear of all threats, including Bari infestations and
the like. This is also another reminder that starting Monday night I will not be
available for some time, as I will be going out on a trip. If you want anything
from me, if you have questions, comments or concerns, you have a little under 48
hours to get in contact with me. Send letters, call the SDC office, try to find
me on comms. Otherwise, fly safe, defend AEU space and don't do anything dumb!
[03:43  4 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Industrial Whip: We are currently at 47% toward our first goal,
and 28% toward the second currently. I will be gone on a trip wth others on
Monday so later today will be my last update for a bit. See you all soon! [05:38
 4 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello all, First, I would like to welcome
Mark William to the pilot corps. Secondly, it looks like we will have to
postpone the meeting I was planning, as at least 3 AEU pilots are going on an
expedition lead by Nissi, starting tonight and probably won't be back for 2 to 3
weeks. Once the expedition returns, I will again attempt to schedule this
meeting. Have a nice day and fly safe! [10:06  4 June 2317 GST]
Notice from the Industrial Whip: Current goal update! We are currently at 60%
toward the first goal and 35% toward the second, Our biggest activity is
starship combat with over 63% of contribution. With two days left in the current
period, the current top three contributors are Constantine, Eli and Vernos.
