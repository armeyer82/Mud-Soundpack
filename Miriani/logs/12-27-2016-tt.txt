Lily Kaise says to Aisling the Fox, "May we go along? I wasn't sure if you heard
me initially."
The aroma of freshly roasted peanuts wafts out of the peanut roasting machine on
the bar.
Akemi Bando moves in from the northeast.
Several women at a table near the door start singing a ditty about lonely
spacers. At the end of the first verse, they stop, toast themselves, and down
their drinks.
Akemi Bando orders a shot of clear sploder.
Akemi Bando takes a sip of a shot of clear sploder.
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.
A man wearing a neon orange smock over his clothes gets up from a table and
wanders out.
Aisling the Fox asks in an unusual Irish accent, "This is rather difficult
position you put me in, no?"
Aisling the Fox takes a bite of a handful of roasted peanuts.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No not really. If you'd rather not, it's
ok."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So thanks and we'll be on our way."
Over the murmur of conversation here, you hear someone cursing entertaining
paper-bound books.
Aisling the Fox nods. "Ah, well. That is good then."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We'd certainly appreciate the
opportunity though and I did ask the other day and you seemed to imply we could
so have a good trip and good luck."
A loud argument breaks out among several tall men at the bar. They stand up,
apparently ready to fight, but the bartender looks up and growls something at
them. The men shrug and sit down again, resuming a low-voiced, relatively civil
conversation.
Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Someone comes in from the hub, takes a quick look around, and leaves again.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "To be honest I do not recall
replying at all. But I could be mistaken. I do try to be polite. But honestly,
right now I am not really on much good terms with AEU."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Ather is except I make."
Akemi Bando takes a sip of a shot of clear sploder.
The aroma of freshly roasted peanuts wafts out of the peanut roasting machine on
the bar.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well we'd like to be on better terms.
Neither Shule nor I hold anything against you nor would we ever want to be
harmful towards you or any mutuality for that matter."
Akemi Bando sits down on a metal chair.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Shule perhaps. You? I do not
know so much. I heard about meeting."
Aisling the Fox takes a bite of a handful of roasted peanuts.
Several asteroid miners at a nearby table exchange stories about 'roid dogs,
laughing all the while.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I certainly understand your
feelings and concerns. I would probably feel the same but I try to accept others
on face value no matter which alliance they are from."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Aisling the Fox nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I understand what has happened in the
past but neither of us were involved and so we probably have a different
perspective."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I look toward future."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I don't hate you or anyone from the
Mutuality and yes I look towards future too."
Several spacers come in and seat themselves at the bar.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I look forward to seeing what Best hands
out to the AEU pilots. Should be very interesting."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Indeed. A it is not looking
like Best future, thanks to AEU."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "In fact the pilots I know from Mutuality
are those I regard in the highest respect including yourself and Anfisa here."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Several young spacers at a table across the room brag to each other about
encountering registered pilots in uncharted space.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well don't cast down hope. Remember not
just one individual dictates. We are not a dictatorship."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "It is appreciated. But words
are words. Actions speak louder. The AEU pilots have helped put in place a
leader who has made his opinion of us known. And they have done so for their own
skins."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Heard that you did not support
joint statement. Disappointing."
Some of the neon signs on the wall suddenly go dark. The bartender glances
around, bangs on the wall with his fist, and the signs flicker back to life.
Aisling the Fox nods to Anfisa of Marzore.
Aisling the Fox gestures vaguely at you.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Your support in statement is
appreciated."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I did but they didn't allow others to
come sign it so that is a not true."
Akemi Bando quickly drains a shot of clear sploder.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I was told you decidedly did
not go."
Akemi Bando puts a shot glass in a trash can.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "And then showed up after
fact."
Several young spacers at a table across the room brag to each other about
encountering registered pilots in uncharted space.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They said if we weren't at the meeting,
we couldn't sign it."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Yes, that is sensible."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Fair weather signatories are not
so useful."
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare
into the middle distance.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "That is true but it has nothing to do
with whether or not I would sign the statement or not. Other pilots didn't go as
well and so do you think they wouldn't have wanted to sign the statement?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I would have allowed other pilots to
have a day or so to come read the statement and decide if he or she wanted to
sign it."
A man across the room raises his mug, roaring a toast to asteroids. His friends
at the table with him laugh, drain their mugs, and yell for more.
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "You actively refused to attend, I
heard."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "That is what I heard as well,
yes."
Anfisa of Marzore asks in a Spinward accent, "Also. What other civ pilots in
AEU?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I did that is true but it has nothing to
do with whether or not I wouldhave signed the statement. I also stated very
publicly that I didn'tcondone the crimes against humanity."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Signing something that you did not
care enough to attend the meeting about means nothing."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well you are entitled to your opinion."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Shule is welcome to come with
us."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Fuck off."
Aisling the Fox gestures vaguely at you.
Lily Kaise smiles at Anfisa of Marzore.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm sorry you feel that way."
Some of the neon signs on the wall suddenly go dark. The bartender glances
around, bangs on the wall with his fist, and the signs flicker back to life.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "You, no. I am sorry."
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "Ok then if you want to go, you can."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent, "He needs permission?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Nope."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I also did not appreciate self
invitation after I announced who I was inviting."
A man wearing a neon orange smock over his clothes gets up from a table and
wanders out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I am sorry though because I do agree
with the statement. The reason I didn't attend wasn't because of that."
Lily Kaise disbands her group.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Yes, because of some petty
bullshit that you cannot get past when you have crisis of your people's own
making to deal with."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yo."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "I understand, I do."
Lily Kaise nods.
[General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Hey there."
The aroma of freshly roasted peanuts wafts out of the peanut roasting machine on
the bar.
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "Melinda."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Glad that you can agree."
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "Bright's Bar
if you wish to go to Fang Wood."
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "We leave
within half a cycle I suspect. Giving time for a couple others to show, since it
is last minute."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll jsut say i'm sorry and thatis all
that I can say and it has nothing to do with the fact that I absolutely agree
with the statement. I do not condone crimes against humanity."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Yes, yes, you agree because it is
easy, do not want to do things that are hard, and so on."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No that isn't it."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "I am in full comprehension of the
situation."
Several asteroid miners at a nearby table exchange stories about 'roid dogs,
laughing all the while.
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "Myself,
Anfisa, Akemi, Luja, hopefully Ather, Pierre, and Liam."
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "I have also
invited Shule."
Lily Kaise kisses you.
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "Have a great time."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "There is such a thing as tacit approval.
If you do not take action against something, and you are aware of it, that is
tacit approval."
Several young spacers at a table across the room brag to each other about
encountering registered pilots in uncharted space.
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Inaction is support of majority
action."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I really didn't have the opportunity to
and neither did other pilots so it was not a democratic process."
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "Lillian? You
wish to come too?"
Anfisa of Marzore asks in a Spinward accent, "What other pilots? Can you name
one?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Angel."
Aisling the Fox laughs.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "You are not a democracy anyway. You're
an individual."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Angel."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I am part of any democratic process and
that process was not."
Akemi Bando idly keys her glittery black metachannel FTL communicator for some
reason.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "At any rate, you really do not know how
I think and exactly waht my values are. Still I would have signed the statement
given the opportunity."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Okay, despite fact that she had
not been around for considerble time, who else? Come on now, offer up names so
it sounds like minority instead of quora."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Yes, yes, sign anything."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No read before you sign obviously."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If I didn't agree, of course I
owuldn't."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Wouldn't."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Yes, yes, you would have signed
anything, as long as it did not require you to actually act."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Sometimes things require
immediate attention. This did."
The bartender finishes filling an order, pulls a cloth from his shoulder, and
wearily wipes off the bar.
Akemi Bando says into her glittery black metachannel FTL communicator, "Maybe
you are full of RATS and made of stone and metal, Ali."
Aisling the Fox says into her orange metachannel FTL communicator, "I
understand. No problems."
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare
into the middle distance.
A security guard in a black jacket steps into the bar, takes a close look
around, then goes back out.
Akemi Bando says into her glittery black metachannel FTL communicator, "I guess
that's why you do not feel like a nest."
Akemi Bando says into her glittery black metachannel FTL communicator, "It is
nice to be appreciated."
Chairs scrape across the bare floor as several people get up to leave.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
A loud argument breaks out among several tall men at the bar. They stand up,
apparently ready to fight, but the bartender looks up and growls something at
them. The men shrug and sit down again, resuming a low-voiced, relatively civil
conversation.
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "You can leave now."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Ultimately choice is made."
Anfisa of Marzore calls out something in a language that you cannot understand
to the bartender.
The aroma of freshly roasted peanuts wafts out of the peanut roasting machine on
the bar.
Anfisa of Marzore orders a large mug of Novabrew Dark.

Subject: Re: There is indeed a Rift Accelerator/Inserter for Alpha 777
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 01:19 27 December 2316 GST

You are correct that I should have checked the reference for the accelerator.
Honestly, I'd just woken up and it did not cross my mind. However, you announced
when the new one went up in 777, so why not when the one goes in 285 that has
not been there in a couple weeks. You're the one responding to me, so why would
I say anything to Shule. I was trying ot make sure that folks knew it was there
now. You've been very noisy on the board when things got replaced, including the
salvage station at 777, and while it was indicated two weeks ago that they would
be alternating, someone looking for salvage opportunities would have no way of
knowing they switched without checking the reference, which there are some
pilots who do not have one or who may forget to use one. I certainly dont'
advocate cluttering the boards every time a station is replaced, however if
something has been gone awhile, especially a couple weeks, it would be nice to
hear it has gone back up. I wasn't looking for an argument here, Lily...just
letting folks know where non-local salvage was now located.

Subject: Re: There is indeed a Rift Accelerator/Inserter for Alpha 777
Author: Morris Corlew

Call it a claim if you want, it was a mistake. I said that already. But the
point stands. If you post that the salvage is being replaced in 777 to let
everyone know, and the salvage in 285 is gone for two weeks and you don't let
anyone know it's back, how does that make for a good comparison. People have to
know it's there. If you tell them when salvage at 777 is replaced, why not tell
them when 285 is back. Make sense? And by the way, this could easily be talked
about on comms. Yes. Morris made a mistake. He is human. Believe it or not. But
Lily makes them too.
