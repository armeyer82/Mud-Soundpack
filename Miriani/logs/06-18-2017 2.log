Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
00:22:06 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
Lily Kaise is Lying close to you with her arms wrapped tight around you ... with a sad and pleading espression on her face. Saying between sobs ... 'please don't go .... please don't leave me ... you are the love of my life ... please don't go!'.
You can go east.

00:23:15 Lily emote looks over at you, with her face tear streaked and says between sobe ... Shule I am so shoecked. What have I done Darling?

00:23:27 Shule Elemmire reaches over and gently caressing your face, wraps his arms around you.

00:24:05 Lily says to you, "Please oh please don't leave me. I'll be so lost."

00:25:26 Lily Kaise says, "You are such an awesome pilot too and the Corps needs you."

00:26:13 Shule squeezes you tight and says, "I'm sorry. I'm here."

00:27:48 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

00:27:52 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

00:27:58 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

00:28:32 Lily says between sobs ... so you won't go? You promise you won't go and leave the AEU pilots behind and me?

00:29:53 Placing gentle kisses on your lips and cheek, Shule says, "Shhh, it'll be ok. I'll stay."

00:30:37 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

00:30:51 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey It's Morris out there."

00:30:58 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she giggles.

00:30:59 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Out where?"

00:31:21 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:31:27 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:31:31 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think I saw some rocks covered in your moss."

00:32:19 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey, if I own all moss, including rift moss, shouldn't I be a lot richer than I am? I mean, if nothin else, the moss channel should be payin me royalties."

00:32:39 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please don't think to much into it sir."

00:32:42 Lily says to you, "I'm so glad but I just hope you will tell me why you felt this way? I know pilot life can be a grind at times but I thought I was at least worth your staying around. Besides what were you going to do back home?"

00:35:52 "You are definitely worth staying around." You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close. "I just remembered a dream I had the other night in which you left me for some reason. You're the only reason I stay around."

00:36:23 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:36:50 Lily Kaise beams at you.

00:37:00 You beam at Lily Kaise.

00:37:02 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:38:16 Lily begins to catch her breath and between softening sobs, she says: I'm so glad Love. When I read your letter, I felt that my heart had been smashed into bits. I felt as though I was jsut an empty shell and I know I will be if you go.

00:38:56 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

00:39:15 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

00:40:47 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

00:40:54 You can't go that way.

00:41:56 Caressing you gently, Shule whispers, "It's going to be ok."

00:44:11 Lily Kaise whispers, "Yo yo yo, the stars I hope you're ok... I just hope you are ok as I still don't understand Love. Whenever you are ready to talk about it if you want to, you know i'm here. I'll always be here for you, no matter what. You are my best friend and nobody can end that.

00:46:20 Shule Elemmire begins lying close to you, both arms wrapped around you.

00:50:53 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

00:53:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

00:57:13 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

01:01:25 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

01:01:35 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

01:03:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:04:10 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:04:15 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:05:15 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Later Mossy one."

01:06:55 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:12:52 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:14:07 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:14:15 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:14:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:27:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:31:25 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

01:33:43 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

01:35:43 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:35:49 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:36:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:36:08 Lily says to you, "I hope I'm not pinching you too hard Love! I just want to be sure you are still here."

01:39:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:44:25 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

01:50:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:55:06 A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.

02:01:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:03:33 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

02:03:43 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

02:06:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:13:48 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

02:33:34 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

02:43:01 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:43:02 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

02:43:02 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else.

02:43:09 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:44:11 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

02:54:19 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

03:04:35 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

03:04:49 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:05:52 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

03:06:02 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

03:08:03 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:08:07 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:08:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:12:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:13:21 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

03:16:28 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:23:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:28:54 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:29:04 Lily says to you, "I love you."

03:29:04 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:29:16 You say to Lily, "I love you too."

03:30:29 "Lips and neck," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

03:30:34 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:35:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:35:52 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.

04:04:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Mighty stompy hero Cheri is here."

04:05:22 Cheri Lindbergh switches a dark metallic pink touch shoes interface off.

04:05:43 Cheri Lindbergh says, "That's right."

04:06:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I hope we will have a probe left for party planet."

04:06:08 Ather says to Cheri, "We have only 7 probes left. Please advise us, stompy one."

04:06:27 Cheri Lindbergh says, "My advice is do whatever."

04:06:42 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

04:06:49 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, use the probes on the bolt? Grand advice! You are truly the true hero of stomp."

04:07:02 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:07:31 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

04:07:32 Ather Jammoa says, "I just wish I had thought of getting close-approach ones, too."

04:07:41 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

04:07:52 Lily says to Ather, "How many does the bolt hold?"

04:07:55 Ather Jammoa says, "I thought that just one type of probe would be enough. Oh well."

04:07:59 Ather Jammoa says, "Uh."

04:08:07 Ather Jammoa asks, "65?"

04:08:28 Lily Kaise says, "One type is better than none and I'd think those would be just fine."

04:08:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, I mean, when I read it on the menu, the probe specifically said "extended observation and close approach""

04:09:07 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Ah?"

04:09:13 Ather Jammoa says, "So, I thought that meant that I didn't have to buy one extended observatoin probe and one close-approach one."

04:09:21 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

04:09:23 Ather Jammoa says, "I dunno."

04:09:24 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "It did not?"

04:09:30 Ather Jammoa says, "Could've sworn it did."

04:09:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:09:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Nissi only got one model of probes, I think."

04:09:54 Ather Jammoa asks, "Oh, she did?"

04:09:56 Lily Kaise says, "No she has two kinds."

04:10:04 Ather Jammoa asks, "So you can just choose what the probe does?"

04:10:07 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

04:10:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yes."

04:10:14 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Oh!"

04:10:15 Ather Jammoa thrusts both fists into the air and cheers.

04:10:20 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Then I have the right probes!"

04:10:31 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "You are ever so wise."

04:10:33 Lily Kaise says, "Cool beans as that's not how it read from the terminal in the shop so that is good to know."

04:10:40 Ather Jammoa says, "No, it was."

04:10:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, some probes can do only one thing."

04:10:55 Ather Jammoa says, "It specifically said for the probe I bought, I'm like 90% sure, that it's good for close-approach, and extended observation."

04:10:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "But I launched probe for a system and I did not get choice of probe."

04:11:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Besides, just listen for when probes are launched or come back. Same model name."

04:11:12 Lily Kaise says, "I did."

04:11:15 Ather Jammoa nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:11:18 Ather Jammoa says, "It was the same model name."

04:11:20 Ather Jammoa says, "He's right."

04:11:21 Lily Kaise says, "I got close and the extended."

04:11:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The probes in the middle of shop list can do both."

04:11:33 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah."

04:11:47 Ather Jammoa says, "The ones that are at like 7500 exploration or something like that."

04:11:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The good specialist probes comes later."

04:12:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Like the gringrongor or something."

04:12:17 Ather Jammoa says, "I don't even remember if there was a probe that could do lander/extended observation/close approach."

04:12:22 Ather Jammoa says, "I doubt it, though."

04:12:24 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ok then yeah I meet the 7500 so maybe that's how it is. It will allow you to launch what you can."

04:12:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I don't remember probe that could do three things, or lander that could do anything else."

04:12:41 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, me either."

04:13:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Don't think I have artifact gathering will to obtain lander in near future either way."

04:13:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, me either."

04:13:49 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, I suppose if there's an artifacting expedition or something I might consider going."

04:14:00 Shule listens to the discssion about  probes, quietly taking notes.

04:14:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "So would I, but not sure I would gather that many."

04:14:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, I might not gather more than a couple hundred, at most."

04:14:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Perhaps until I reach the holy 10000 of the points."

04:14:29 Ather Jammoa says, "There are people like Morris though who will probably gather like 800."

04:14:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That is a better probe."

04:14:33 Ather Jammoa chuckles.

04:14:34 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:14:37 You chuckle.

04:14:52 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm hoping I get a good chunk from this run towards 10000."

04:14:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hey I might go for some of those!"

04:14:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I might launch my galleon after that to aim for the landers."

04:15:07 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Better than artifacts."

04:15:13 Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Good idea!"

04:15:13 Ather Jammoa nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:15:28 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Maybe this time we can find the downward clans from farport."

04:15:33 Ather Jammoa says, "Er."

04:15:35 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean the upward ones."

04:16:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Heh."

04:16:25 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

04:16:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Not sure what I would outfit galleon with. Air fortress wouldn't be too useful for it. Maybe a station, but would run out of probes too fast for it to matter much."

04:16:56 Lily Kaise nods.

04:17:00 You nod.

04:17:00 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a small round personal taco pizza.

04:17:15 Ather Jammoa removes a gold slipcloth from a midnight blue backpack for a moment.

04:17:18 I don't understand that.

04:17:20 You are carrying nothing.

04:17:25 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah then could dock a couple of smaller ships with extra probes."

04:17:38 Ather Jammoa crumples up his sheet of white paper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

04:17:40 Ather Jammoa crumples up his stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

04:17:54 Ather Jammoa asks, "Why did I have a blank sheet o fpaper?"

04:17:55 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

04:20:26 Lily says to Vernos, "I'm sure you will get quite something."

04:20:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, galleon does have less range than this. No siren battery."

04:20:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It could be useful."

04:20:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Maybe."

04:21:01 Vernos Bailey asks, "Is siren battery only on this ship?"

04:21:02 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Depends."

04:21:16 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "The galleon has less range when it comes to charge, but it can make faster speeds."

04:21:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Sure."

04:21:25 Ather says to Vernos, "Na."

04:21:28 Lily Kaise says, "You may get credit for I think it's planet assists or something ike that and probably actual credit for planets."

04:21:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Nissi actually has fair number of sirem batteries."

04:21:59 Ather Jammoa says, "She has like two, I think."

04:22:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:22:02 Vernos Bailey says, "So we should do a race between this class and a galleon."

04:22:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "One on this, one on war galleon and one on super EAOS carrier."

04:22:10 Vernos Bailey says, "And see who wins."

04:22:17 Ather Jammoa asks, "Oh, she has one on the war galleon too?"

04:22:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I think."

04:22:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Not entirely sure."

04:22:34 Ather Jammoa says, "I didn't think she had one on the galleon, but it's been ages since I've been on it."

04:22:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I vaguely remember seeing it when I had a look of it."

04:22:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Not when it was a normal galleon."

04:22:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Likely came with war galleon application."

04:23:06 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh wow, I still have a key to her glaleon, too."

04:23:13 Ather Jammoa nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:23:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I did not manage it, but maybe if I went farther."

04:23:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec shrugs helplessly.

04:24:02 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Well, when was the last time you led a very extended trip into the unknown?"

04:24:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hmm, probably at aquarium."

04:24:25 Ather Jammoa says, "You misunderstand."

04:24:34 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Into uncharted, undiscovered, unexplored territories!"

04:24:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, it went beyond aquarium."

04:24:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh."

04:24:56 You say, "Yeah, it did. I remember that trip."

04:24:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Dropped a station at aquarium, went away from it for a bit."

04:25:05 Ather Jammoa nods.

04:25:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Guess range wasn't that extreme, though."

04:25:16 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Turned back when met a zone of rift calm."

04:25:30 Ather Jammoa says, "Cause I mean like Nissi, and some of the stuff she did was into pretty uncharted space."

04:25:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I am not as much uncharted."

04:25:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I like charts very much."

04:25:52 Ather Jammoa grins.

04:26:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah we went a good bit beyond on that trip."

04:26:15 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise.

04:26:20 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:26:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Was a great trip!"

04:26:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I will be honest, I do not enjoy explorations for sake of it as much as some others."

04:26:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I enjoy going places."

04:26:53 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "If we're being honest I'd have to say I'm kind of in agreement with that."

04:26:56 Lily Kaise says, "I don't enjoy the ones closer to comms but I do enjoy trips like this one."

04:27:07 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, sure, exploring is all well and good, but I do definitely like going places."

04:27:16 Lily Kaise nods and nods and nods.

04:27:21 You nod.

04:27:48 Lily Kaise says, "Going or discovering new places is really wonderful. I so enjoyed Xia He and then onto the Buddha."

04:27:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, once we find suitable distant target for my mobile fortress, I will be happy to probe things on way there."

04:28:25 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:28:29 Ather Jammoa says, "It's fun to discover some weird obscure thing that people have likely only seen through a telescope lens, but sometimes you kind of hope to find a pocket of humanity, as it were. We've sure managed to scatter ourselves all over the galaxy."

04:28:38 Lily Kaise nods.

04:28:40 Ather Jammoa beams at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:28:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Ather."

04:28:50 Ather Jammoa says, "What."

04:28:56 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, don't really want to use fortress on pockets of humanity."

04:28:58 Vernos Bailey says, "I think you need to have a word with your roft cockroach about these speeds."

04:29:08 Vernos Bailey says, "Rift I mean."

04:29:08 Lily Kaise blinks.

04:29:10 Vernos Bailey coughs.

04:29:11 Ather Jammoa grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:29:27 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Depends. I'm totally all for using them on Mr. Kelsey."

04:29:40 Ather Jammoa says, "You can just kinda turn your back and say we took over the ship."

04:29:42 Ather Jammoa chortles.

04:29:47 You chuckle.

04:30:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I had no clue what they were doing."

04:30:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Seems legit."

04:30:07 Vernos Bailey says, "None at all."

04:30:32 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I don't know what happened, grand Mutuality council! Crazy alliance pilits took my shiiiiip and locked me up!"

04:30:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Cannot go wrong."

04:31:01 Ather Jammoa laughs.

04:31:22 Ather Jammoa says, "Now."

04:31:23 Ather Jammoa strokes an icky plastic cockroach lovingly.

04:31:31 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

04:31:33 Lily after a little surprised refleciton ... she chortles.

04:32:13 Ather says to an icky plastic cockroach, "Glorious and mighty cockroach, we marvel at the miracles you have given us! We humble ourselves before you once more though, and beg for grandly swifter speeds. Grant us this gift, mighty cockroach!"

04:32:20 Ather says to Vernos, "There."

04:32:27 You grin.

04:32:34 Vernos Bailey grins.

04:33:06 Lily shrieks eeeeeeeek!

04:33:13 Ather Jammoa glances at Lily Kaise.

04:33:13 Vernos Bailey says, "Thank you."

04:33:14 Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:33:18 Lily Kaise laughs at Ather Jammoa.

04:33:21 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

04:33:25 You say to Lily, "It's not going to eat you."

04:33:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:33:31 You chuckle.

04:33:34 Lily says to Ather, "Sorry I'm not over-fond of icky coakroaches."

04:33:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:33:40 You laugh.

04:34:00 Lily Kaise says, "I stomped on meny when I was out hunting stars to look at."

04:34:05 Lily Kaise says, "Many that is."

04:34:15 You exclaim, "Poor cockroach!"

04:34:19 You say, "Cockrches."

04:34:22 Lily Kaise says, "Nope not poor them."

04:34:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Mine has a name. It is Pierre."

04:34:30 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

04:34:33 Lily Kaise says, "Were food for the lizards."

04:34:33 Ather Jammoa says, "He insists on being known as Pierre."

04:34:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:34:42 You laugh.

04:34:43 Vernos says to Eli, "We should do short trip to Aria VII when we get back just to see it ourselves."

04:34:52 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

04:34:58 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

04:34:59 Ather Jammoa says, "I can take you two, but I'm not getting out of the ship."

04:35:07 Lily Kaise says, "Aria Vii isn't a casual experience."

04:35:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Fine place for a tan."

04:35:15 Ather Jammoa says, "Too much fucking trauma surrounding that planet."

04:35:25 Lily Kaise exclaims, "No doubt!"

04:35:26 Vernos Bailey says, "No one called it casual."

04:35:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Educational maybe."

04:35:34 Ather Jammoa says, "You go in and it's totally on your own heads."

04:35:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Exactly dudes!"

04:36:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Deceiving helhole, that planet."

04:36:30 Vernos says to Ather, "Hey if I ever stepped foot on that planet.I would be fully suited and go look, get back on the ship and be like oh hell no to a second trip."

04:37:01 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah and you better hope that your suit will hold up as there is no guarantee!"

04:37:15 You say, "Very true."

04:38:07 I don't understand that.

04:38:09 I don't understand that.

04:38:11 Vernos Bailey says, "Experiences are meant to be educational."

04:38:13 Lily Kaise says, "I saw a whole lot of light and not exactly what I wanted to see when that flare occurred when we visited that time. I just was so grateful that it wasn't stronger."

04:38:13 You are carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio in your right hand.

04:38:21 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:38:24 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:39:16 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:39:18 You finish off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:39:22 To whom/what do you want to give it?

04:39:27 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

04:39:30 You give a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:39:49 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

04:39:56 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:41:36 Vernos says to Ather, "I have no issue accepting responsibilty for what happens to me if you did that."

04:41:40 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

04:44:01 Lily Kaise shrugs.

04:44:25 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:44:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:46:25 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:50:25 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:50:44 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

04:52:13 Ather Jammoa says, "The riftcockroach wants us to go eastnortheast and down, apparently."

04:52:16 Ather Jammoa chuckles.

04:52:36 Lily Kaise says, "Woo wish we could."

04:52:39 Lily Kaise grins.

04:52:46 You grin.

04:52:52 You stretch.

04:53:03 You say, "Time for bed for me I think. Good night all."

04:53:04 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but I do see that."

04:53:07 Lily Kaise grins.

04:53:30 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:53:32 You wave.

04:53:37 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:53:53 Lily Kaise waves. "Nite everyone."

04:54:04 You smile.

04:54:07 You can't go that way.

04:54:08 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

04:54:08 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.

04:54:50 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woooo a white egg yay ya yayayayya."

04:56:13 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:56:27 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:56:32 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

04:57:54 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:58:01 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:58:17 You say to Lily, "Well, you don't have to worry about that for a while."

04:58:27 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:58:46 Lily says to an alliance information assistant, "Used to like my space but you are so warm and I feel so secure with you here."

04:58:50 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:58:54 Lily Kaise cackles!

04:59:04 You laugh.

04:59:12 Lily says to an alliance information assistant, "You are just not necessary!"

04:59:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:59:17 You laugh.

05:03:17 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:03:31 You say to Lily, "I love you."

05:05:55 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

05:08:33 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

05:08:43 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

05:09:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:10:42 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

05:11:55 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:12:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

05:21:29 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

05:37:40 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:37:45 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:38:34 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

05:38:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:39:03 You say to Lily, "Good night my love. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:39:57 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:40:43 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you."

05:41:30 You say to Lily, "I love you too. Night."

05:42:06 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:42:12 Lily Kaise says, "Nite Hun."

05:42:50 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:42:59 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:48:45 Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.

05:48:57 You blink heavily and then doze off.

05:59:13 Five tetras dart around in formation, and then weave around the plastic diver.

05:59:30 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "What the."

06:02:26 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

06:09:28 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

06:09:37 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

06:10:03 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

06:16:55 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

06:23:40 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

06:30:36 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

06:38:01 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

06:46:16 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

06:55:48 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

07:05:49 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

07:07:21 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

07:10:47 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

07:10:57 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

07:18:15 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well when you all find it."

07:22:13 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

07:40:47 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

07:43:48 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

07:47:14 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

07:54:10 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

08:04:54 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

08:11:22 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

08:11:32 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

08:29:05 Thuds echo throughout the ship as micrometeorites slam into the hull.

08:41:33 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

08:52:14 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

09:02:27 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

09:13:02 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

09:14:00 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

09:14:10 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

09:16:07 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Goodnight Pierre."

09:44:01 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

09:54:28 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

10:04:37 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

10:15:05 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

10:16:13 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

10:16:23 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:46:14 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

10:56:33 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

11:06:48 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

11:16:50 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

11:16:59 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

11:19:58 The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

11:19:59 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

11:38:06 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

11:38:16 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

11:38:16 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

11:38:26 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

11:43:38 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

12:08:17 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

12:18:38 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

12:23:51 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

12:23:52 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

12:24:51 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

12:34:59 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

12:39:58 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

12:40:08 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

12:44:52 The tetras drift apart momentarily, then suddenly converge and flit in another direction.

12:44:52 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

12:48:12 The tetras drift apart momentarily, then suddenly converge and flit in another direction.

12:48:13 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

12:49:45 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

12:50:45 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

12:52:07 The tetras seem to startle and zip across the fishbowl.

12:52:07 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

12:52:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

12:52:28 The tetras seem to startle and zip across the fishbowl.

12:52:28 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

12:52:39 The tetras drift apart momentarily, then suddenly converge and flit in another direction.

12:53:29 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

12:53:52 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

12:53:52 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:54:05 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey woo."

12:54:13 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "More gas planets."

13:02:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:10:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:10:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:10:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:10:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:12:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:12:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:12:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:13:58 The starship has left a unique area of space.

13:14:02 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

13:14:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:16:36 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

13:17:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

13:34:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

13:36:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:43:53 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

13:47:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:51:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

13:54:17 A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.

14:04:30 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

14:14:46 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

14:14:50 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

14:15:00 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

14:29:24 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

14:34:33 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

14:34:38 You kiss Lily Kaise.

14:35:42 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

14:35:48 You say to Lily, "Hi love."

14:36:18 Lily Kaise kisses you.

14:36:32 Lily says to a bulky high-energy plasma explosive, "Love. Sorry I was reading."

14:36:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

14:36:44 You laugh.

14:36:48 You laugh.

14:36:51 Lily says to you, "Hi Love. I was reading."

14:36:59 You smile at Lily Kaise. "No problem."

14:37:37 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

14:37:38 Lily Kaise says, "Seems there were 2 more planets discovered. That's up to 47 now."

14:37:44 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

14:37:50 You exclaim, "Yeah, I saw that. That's awesome!"

14:37:59 Lily Kaise nods.

14:39:41 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

14:44:52 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

14:45:07 Shule smiles down at the castle.

14:45:44 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's very nice."

14:45:49 You grin.

14:45:52 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

14:45:57 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

14:55:13 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

15:05:26 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

15:09:02 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

15:15:41 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

15:15:51 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

15:36:45 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

15:45:42 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

15:46:42 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

15:53:15 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:56:04 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

15:59:32 The room grows a bit more chill.

16:08:32 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/All.

16:09:47 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

16:11:07 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

16:11:13 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

16:18:07 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

16:18:18 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

16:26:00  You are wearing a blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of white socks. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

16:26:00 You are carrying nothing.

16:26:05 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

16:26:08 I see no "shoes" here.

17:57:17 The tetras drift apart momentarily, then suddenly converge and flit in another direction.

17:57:17 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

17:58:19 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

17:58:49 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

18:02:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

18:03:24 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

18:05:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

18:08:58 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

18:09:49 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:10:26 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

18:10:26 A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

18:10:43 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

18:10:43 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

18:11:58 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

18:12:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:12:52 Ather Jammoa presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

18:13:05 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:13:27 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

18:13:30 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "Woo grand objects!"

18:13:43 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

18:13:55 Melinda Michaels says to Ather, "Do you know how well the heated masses do in a furnace?"

18:14:01 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I have to say... this is my best approach ever."

18:14:05 Ather Jammoa says, "The hydrogen does pretty good."

18:14:10 Ather Jammoa says, "That's one of the thigns you get from it."

18:14:27 Ather Jammoa says, "So, yeah, if you want to top off here, it's as good a place as any."

18:14:30 Lily Kaise nods. "I remember Nissi saying it was best."

18:14:38 Melinda Michaels says, "I see a bunch of heated masses. We are kinda low on debris. I figured we could get a couple since she stopped here."

18:14:40 Ather Jammoa says, "One of the best."

18:14:48 Ather says to Melinda, "Amight as well."

18:14:53 Melinda Michaels says, "We've got like 18k in storage."

18:14:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Wait for spectroscopy to finish, then salvage away."

18:15:01 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Fill 'er up!"

18:15:03 Lily Kaise grins.

18:15:11 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

18:15:15 Ather Jammoa says, "If you want, I could fill it with the dumb grapple."

18:15:21 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

18:15:22 Ather Jammoa shudders.

18:15:40 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

18:15:45 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

18:15:45 Ather Jammoa strides south.

18:15:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

18:16:31 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

18:16:58 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

18:18:35 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

18:18:36 Lily Kaise glides south.

18:19:35 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Should I shovel some?"

18:19:57 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't turn the furnace on but can see if the chamber needs filled."

18:20:07 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah wasn't going to turn it on."

18:20:19 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nope it's full."

18:20:36 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

18:20:41 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

18:21:59 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

18:22:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

18:23:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly west.

18:26:31 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

18:26:47 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

18:26:48 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

18:26:59 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

18:27:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:27:21 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Analysis complete! Starting salvage."

18:27:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:37:19 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

18:37:27 You hear a solid thunk sound as some interstellar dust is expelled from the storage room.

18:37:51 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

18:38:02 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

18:38:02 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

18:38:02 The starship has left a unique area of space.

18:38:03 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:38:11 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

18:38:21 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

18:38:29 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

18:38:30 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That will be a misdemeanor sir!"

18:38:31 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

18:38:34 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

18:38:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Most of the stuff I salvaged was hydrogen. I was very picky until the veyr end."

18:38:49 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

18:38:49 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

18:38:56 Lily Kaise glides east.

18:40:02 Ather Jammoa says, "It's fine. A lot of people want to put a lot of weird shit in their reports. Yours wasn't too bad."

18:40:20 Rogue Romano nods and grins. "Thanks."

18:40:31 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

18:40:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

18:40:53 Ather Jammoa says, "I wish I had known that my bolt could hold 62 probes before we left! Oh well."

18:41:00 Rogue Romano grins.

18:41:05 Ather Jammoa says, "I kept buying upgrades for it until like, the last day."

18:41:07 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

18:41:16 Rogue Romano glances down at her platinum watch with a round face momentarily.

18:41:52 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

18:41:52 Ather Jammoa strides south.

18:42:02 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

18:42:03 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

18:42:16 Ather Jammoa says, "At least we still look like we're on pace to make it home without needing to recharge."

18:42:22 Lily Kaise says, "Wow that's great as my platform can only hold 70."

18:42:32 Melinda Michaels says, "I am betting we have to recharge."

18:42:46 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

18:42:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, we're at 51% right now. It depends on how the flow is. If it stays like this or similar, we might actually be fiiiiine."

18:42:59 Melinda Michaels says, "With around 500 light-years to go."

18:43:18 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Maybe 400."

18:43:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Lal the poweh."

18:43:32 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

18:43:34 Lily Kaise glides south.

18:43:49 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

18:43:50 Ather Jammoa says, "Don't forget, we had that day of calm."

18:43:57 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup we did."

18:44:05 Melinda Michaels says, "That's why I changed it to 400."

18:44:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

18:46:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

19:13:48 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee with a large neon pink spiky flower appliqued on the front, a pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a 
19:13:48 metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of hot cafe mocha in her right hand.

19:14:49 I don't understand that.

19:18:33 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

19:20:32 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

19:29:10 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

19:38:59 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

19:39:04 Rogue Romano finishes off the last of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

19:39:07 Rogue Romano crumples up her stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

19:39:16 Rogue Romano quickly drains a shot of chilled vodka.

19:39:26 Rogue Romano gives a shot glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

19:39:36 Rogue Romano says, "Okay, nap time for me."

19:39:41 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

19:39:42 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

19:39:45 Rogue Romano waves.

19:39:48 Rogue Romano slinks south.

19:40:22 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

19:40:32 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

19:42:31 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

19:46:32 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:56:32 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

19:59:26 Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

19:59:33 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

20:00:32 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

20:02:32 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

20:06:08 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

20:06:11 Vernos Bailey coughs.

20:06:20 Vernos Bailey puts a bar of light brown spicy soap in a small cloth sack.

20:06:31 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

20:06:32 Vernos Bailey says, "That was embarassing."

20:06:47 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

20:07:42 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

20:07:45 Morris Corlew waves.

20:07:49 Morris Corlew sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

20:09:22 Nissi Valdaire asks, "What happened?"

20:10:11 Morris Corlew asks, "Hmm?"

20:10:23 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

20:10:32 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:10:40 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:11:06 Vernos Bailey says, "I walked in here in my boxers after the shower, pants in hand."

20:11:11 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

20:11:12 Morris Corlew grins.

20:11:16 Nissi Valdaire switches a metallic purple swivel einrophone off.

20:11:54 Nissi Valdaire grins.

20:12:27 Vernos Bailey says, "Well I suppose I could be glad it was not a landing pad."

20:13:03 Lily Kaise says, "They won't arrest you if youhave some form of a bottom garment on."

20:13:21 "Considerin there's nobody to arrest ya at all on a ship..." Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

20:13:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:14:32 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

20:15:58 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:19:21 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

20:19:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

20:20:32 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:26:28 Vernos Bailey yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

20:26:32 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:29:53 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

20:33:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

20:33:26 Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

20:36:32 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:40:05 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

20:42:39 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

20:42:49 Listen. You need to be careful.

20:45:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:45:31 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

20:45:31 A black digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

20:45:36 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

20:45:36 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

20:56:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

20:57:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Woo."

20:57:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec examines an emerald green ice cream dispenser for a moment.

20:57:24 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec presses a gold button on the front of an emerald green ice cream dispenser. The contraption hums and gurgles for a moment; then the noise dies away, and a cold root beer float is deposited into the dispensing area in the front, which he promptly retrieves.

20:57:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

20:57:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec stirs a cold root beer float a bit and then digs around for a spoonful of ice cream and eats it.

20:58:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec navigates his royal blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:59:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Probes everywhere."

21:02:32 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:05:43 Morris Corlew waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

21:10:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec waves to Morris Corlew.

21:12:40 They talk about you when you are asleep, you know.

21:14:05 Morris Corlew nods and grins. "I expect 'em too."

21:14:13 Vernos Bailey grins.

21:14:32 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

21:14:48 [MTTS] Ulias: Happy Father's Day to any of you hosties that might be Daddy's and even though this is normally frowned upon, I don't think you hosts will mind this one time to say the same to all you Father's out there. Thank you for breeding a whole new set of SC players heheh.

21:20:08 Eli Grey dashes in from the south.

21:20:12 Eli Grey asks, "Did I miss anything?"

21:20:13 Eli Grey zips up a silver and green shipsuit with the AEU logo centered on the chest and fastens a button on his shoulder.

21:20:18 Morris says to Eli, "Everything."

21:20:19 Eli Grey grins.

21:20:23 Lily Kaise chuckles at Eli Grey.

21:20:38 Eli Grey says, "Oh.. right. the board."

21:20:42 Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:20:44 Morris says to Eli, "We got home, charged up, fixed the furnace, and now we're headed the other direction."

21:20:46 Morris Corlew grins at Eli Grey.

21:21:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We are so very fast."

21:21:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec eats a spoonful of drippy ice cream from a cold root beer float.

21:21:44 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

21:21:46 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

21:21:59 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

21:22:20 Eli Grey grins.

21:22:32 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

21:22:40 Eli Grey says, "You guys are funny, I almost believed it for a second."

21:22:49 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:22:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

21:23:05 Is it really worth it? This?

21:23:19 Eli Grey says, "It's totally worth it."

21:23:28 Morris Corlew says, "Indeed."

21:24:19 Eli Grey says, "I used to lay on the roof of the apartment building and satre up at the sky, dreaming of this exact thing. So yeah, I'd say it's worht it."

21:24:23 Eli Grey chuckles.

21:24:33 Lily Kaise smiles.

21:24:38 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

21:24:44 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

21:25:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "If you seen rift things while lying down awake, you had fucked up mind."

21:26:05 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

21:26:05 Eli Grey laughs.

21:26:17 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:26:18 Eli Grey says, "No no, nothign like this? This is definintely not what I was expecting."

21:26:38 Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.

21:27:15 Eli Grey says, "I still remember being all proud of myself for getting like five hundred sectors out.. might have even been a thousand I don't remember. I just remember it took forever."

21:27:32 Eli Grey says, "Oh tha'ts right, it was I think a thousand roudn trip or something."

21:27:36 Eli Grey shrugs.

21:28:18 Eli Grey says, "It was a thousand yeah.. I used to just fly in cube shapes around planet sectrors looing for forgotten tidbits."

21:28:23 Eli Grey shrugs.

21:28:35 Eli Grey says, "Which.. seems really stupid now that we travel several times the speed of light."

21:29:06 Morris Corlew says, "The good ol' days before Fienstein. Nothin stupid about it. Can't do what ya ain't got the tech for. It's like...sayin walkin's stupid before you've got vehicles. Just ain't so."

21:29:13 Eli Grey grins at Morris Corlew.

21:29:41 Eli Grey says, "I just mean, that I was probably enver going to find anythign that way, but yeah like you aid, it was the best I could do."

21:29:49 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

21:30:20 Eli says to Morris, "Your special lady crushed some repairs last night by the way. It was just me and her awake when the drive busted. She knows how to take care of business."

21:30:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "Ather used to lead those sublight trips too back in the day. I remember we spent like a whole day autovectoring north from Mir or something like that."

21:30:46 Eli Grey nods to Nissi Valdaire.

21:30:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Classical journeys."

21:30:52 Morris Corlew says, "And...never know what you could find. I mean...yeah, we come out here to find planets and stuff, but...toolin around home ain't gonna get you the points and credits, but...if that's all you're out here for, somethin's wrong."

21:30:55 Eli Grey says, "Glad to know I wasn't the only one doing stuff like that."

21:30:57 Eli Grey grins.

21:31:28 Eli Grey says, "That's how I figured out how to vector from Old Earth to L5. Not much figuring out but was still a nice little surprise."

21:31:31 Morris says to Eli, "Glad she was up."

21:31:38 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

21:31:42 Eli says to Morris, "Me too."

21:31:44 Morris Corlew says, "Yep. I remember when I figured that out."

21:31:45 Morris Corlew grins.

21:32:23 Eli Grey says, "You can rift donwards too, through the Vortex for a bit."

21:32:27 Eli Grey says, "Er.. not rift, vector."

21:32:50 "Yep." Morris Corlew nods. "All them beacons over in that are are pretty close together. Easily accessible just with a regular drive."

21:33:11 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

21:33:22 Morris Corlew says, "Yep, sure do."

21:33:44 Eli Grey says, "Nah, you don't hve to."

21:33:48 Eli Grey grins at Morris Corlew.

21:34:01 Eli Grey says, "Oen could argue, that exploration is all about going somewhere without wanting to go anywhere."

21:34:06 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

21:34:17 Eli Grey says, "I mean.. this whole trip had no destination whatsoever."

21:34:20 Morris Corlew asks, "If you don't wanna go somewhere, ain't ya usually gettin kidnapped?"

21:34:25 Eli Grey laughs at Morris Corlew.

21:34:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:34:32 Eli Grey says, "Well,  when you put it like that..."

21:34:34 Morris Corlew says, "Goin somewhere ain't got nothin to do with an actual destination."

21:35:21 Morris Corlew says, "Cause remember, it ain't the destination, but the journey that matters."

21:35:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:36:18 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

21:36:57 Morris says to Vernos Bailey, "Yo."

21:37:07 Vernos Bailey says, "Yo."

21:37:14 Eli Grey nods to Vernos Bailey.

21:38:32 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:40:19 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

21:40:21 Vernos Bailey slumps in a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars and goes to sleep.

21:43:39 You're really alone here. So very alone.

21:43:57 Morris Corlew frowns and glances around at his surroundings.

21:44:18 Remember what I said.

21:44:22 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

21:44:28 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

21:44:38 Morris Corlew says, "We're now rift food."

21:46:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Alas."

21:46:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec eats a spoonful of ice cream from a cold root beer float then stirs the drink, blending the ice cream and beverage together.

21:46:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:46:27 Eli Grey says, "So weird."

21:50:48 Morris says to Eli, "What, bein eaten by some rift thing?"

21:54:32 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

21:55:56 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

21:55:59 Damien Goss sits down.

21:56:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:56:36 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:58:50 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

21:59:04 Eli Grey says, "Yeah.. it's quite strange. Possibly one of the strangest."

22:00:04 Eli Grey says, "And, it hadn't occured to me until you guys pointed it out, but we definintely get pooped out somewhere."

22:00:21 Eli Grey says, "I suppose in theory it could just be another generic organic sphincter but..."

22:02:28 Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

22:03:52 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

22:04:17 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

22:06:14 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

22:06:15 Morris Corlew grins.

22:06:32 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

22:10:32 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:14:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec upends a cold root beer float and drinks the rest of the creamy beverage.

22:14:28 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

22:14:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Through the butt, we will find the light."

22:14:42 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:19:40 Vernos Bailey says, "Hmm slowing down."

22:19:49 Morris Corlew says, "Been for awhile."

22:21:26 Morris Corlew says, "Gonna get a good bit slower from lookin at the forecast too."

22:21:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Thought it was supposed to increase."

22:22:12 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah, but look at the direction it'll be comin from."

22:22:59 Vernos Bailey says, "Well maybe we will get lucky and find something soon."

22:23:18 Morris Corlew says, "The further up it comes from, the slower we'll get. Even with a flow increase, it usually don't counteract that completely."

22:24:00 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

22:24:04 Morris Corlew waves to Rogue Romano.

22:24:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Maybe there will be a storm."

22:24:41 Morris Corlew says, "Never know."

22:24:55 Rogue Romano waves.

22:25:06 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

22:25:38 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

22:25:41 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

22:25:45 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

22:25:49 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

22:26:36 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

22:28:32 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

22:36:01 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

22:36:50 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

22:38:22 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

22:38:30 Morris says to a Tardick lizard named Freyja, "Howdy there."

22:38:32 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:40:22 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.

22:40:36 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Freyja's warm scaly skin.

22:42:32 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:44:32 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:46:32 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:46:56 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

22:47:06 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

22:47:06 Morris Corlew says, "And...rift poo."

22:47:14 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

22:47:16 Morris Corlew says, "Oh. Got pooped into hell."

22:47:46 Vernos Bailey laughs.

22:53:22 A Tardick lizard named Freyja's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:55:52 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly south.

22:56:41 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

22:59:14 Eli Grey blinks heavily and then dozes off.

23:00:35 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:02:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:08:48 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

23:16:34 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:19:01 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

23:21:28 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:21:33 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:21:33 A riftstorm appears to be 2.95 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Up and Slightly Eastsoutheast.

23:21:39 Morris Corlew chuckles. "There's your storm, Pierre."

23:29:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Seems like it."

23:29:24 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

23:33:12 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

23:34:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:36:41 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

23:36:41 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:37:19 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:37:26 Sarah Bellamy waves.

23:37:58 Morris Corlew smiles at Sarah Bellamy.

23:43:29 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

23:43:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The storm is coming slowly and slower."

23:43:55 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

23:43:59 Sarah Bellamy waves to Morris Corlew.

23:44:28 Sarah says to Morris, "I'm half asleep. I did not see you smilin."

23:44:31 Sarah Bellamy stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:44:33 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew.

23:44:34 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:44:37 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:44:54 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy on the lips.

23:44:59 Sarah Bellamy squeezes Morris Corlew affectionately.

23:45:08 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

23:48:11 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

23:48:20 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

23:49:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That fellow at end of blood river seems a bit depressed. Maybe he could use a delicious smoothies."

23:49:56 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

23:49:56 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Uh...sure."

23:49:57 Morris Corlew nods.

23:50:03 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:50:28 Sarah Bellamy nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

23:52:56 Sarah nestles herself under Morris's chin.

23:53:22 Rogue slaps a hand over her mouth and yawns.

23:53:25 Morris Corlew grins at Sarah Bellamy.

23:53:28 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy lovingly on the top of her head.

23:53:35 Sarah Bellamy beams.

23:53:43 Sarah says to Morris, "Never quit doin' that."

23:53:49 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew on the nose.

23:53:55 Morris pretends to sneeze.

23:53:58 Sarah Bellamy says, "Or that."

23:54:00 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

23:54:00 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy lovingly on the top of her head.

23:54:03 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy lovingly on the top of her head.

23:54:06 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy lovingly on the top of her head.

23:54:09 Morris Corlew grins.

23:54:09 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

23:54:16 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hmm."

23:54:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Come here, storm."

23:54:57 Damien Goss says, "If we can see it from that far off, it must be pretty big."

23:55:25 Morris Corlew says, "This ship can usually see 'em from almost 3LTC."

23:56:32 Rogue Romano says, "Think I'm goin' to snooze for a bit."

23:56:34 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:56:37 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

23:56:42 Damien Goss waves to Rogue Romano.

23:56:42 Morris says to Rogue, "Rest well."

23:56:46 Sarah says to Rogue, "Rest well."

23:56:50 Rogue Romano nods and waves.

23:56:53 Rogue Romano slinks south.

23:58:34 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:58:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The power of expedition sensors is limitless."

23:59:13 Morris Corlew nods.
