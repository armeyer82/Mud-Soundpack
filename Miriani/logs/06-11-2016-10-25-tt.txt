-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small white trash can, Shule
Elemmire's workbench, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go east.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She has the phrase "Please love me in all the right places Shule." written on
her forehead in dark metallic blue letters.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a clear camera with a
saucy strap. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Michael Winters takes a sip of a glass of hot hazelnut coffee and freshly brewed
coffee with cream and sugar.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "No more nasty side effects from that
panel explosion?"
'I don't think so.
You say, "I don't think so."
Kim Saunders smiles. "Glad to hear."
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.

we spotted Pre-Stellar Object 6712-6277, and despite any reasons not to go, I
took the responsibility of going in and taking a look. we found grade 70 and 80
debris and the luminosity was sol-equivalent. the signal from the extra-long NDB
at the torus was at 31 percent. after taking an image we continued our journey
home.

1JILF.D1G [0306 GST]
Discovered Opik-Oort Signature 3747-3454 after about 3.62 LTC
Anfisa charted earlier and we were 85.88 LTC from Comms and the XL NDB reading
was 35 from the Torus.
Chunks were sparse but the one present was 90 grade.
Luminosity was obviously dimwhich is typical for an Opik-Oort.
Photo was obtained, we recharged and resumed our course.

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
It appears to be at Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Command Ring; Port.
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. It is asleep. Its stomach is
bulging, but it seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark

A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly southeast.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She has the phrase "Please love me in all the right places Shule." written on
her forehead in dark metallic blue letters.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a clear camera with a
saucy strap. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
A hooded, indistinct figure rowing a floating bathtub raises one arm and waves
at you as the truck passes.

limit as my true take on it is if you invest in a ship for exploration, if you
don't take risks so that the crew can benefit from whatever is possible, then
why do it in the first place?"
An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

This electric blue synthcotton shipsuit skims the body, its close fit reducing
snags on equipment aboard a ship or station. With a front zip closure, it also
buttons at the shoulder. The material is heavy and durable, and a spiral galaxy
has been printed on the chest.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,

With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.

You sniff at Lily Kaise. You smell the delicate fragrance of a single dewy
rosebud.
The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't
be felt.
