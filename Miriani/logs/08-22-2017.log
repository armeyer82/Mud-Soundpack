08-20-17:
  * Fixed an issue that caused 'Pinpoint Point of Purchase' to lag for up to a second. Also (unrelatedly) made it skip the menu if you only have one object in your hand.
  * Fixed a bug where one-time walkstyles (e.g. MOONWALK NORTH) didn't work in dynamic rooms (asteroids, digsites, etc).

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

08-22-17:
  * To one up Mitchell, @soundpacks now also accepts a string argument to search names.
  * You can now get information about a soundpack by supplying an argument to the @soundpacks command. For example, @soundpacks 1 will pull up the information about the Not Real soundpack.

08-21-17:
  * Added a pronoun practice option to the forcefield lab on Empanda, which can be found in the options for changing forcefield messages. This allows players to practice using the various pronoun codes that can be used in forcefield messages without having to go through the process of changing them on their forcefields.
