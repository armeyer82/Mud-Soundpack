00:37 #$#soundpack_pong

00:37 #$#soundpack_lag 101

00:37 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "I would, if I was him. If I knew I had someone focussed on targetting me, I'd do what this Blotto is presumably doing just to irritate my opponent."

00:38 #$#soundpack_pong

00:38 #$#soundpack_lag 146

00:38 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Especially if I didn't have the skills to do anything else. But actually, if I was targetted, I'd probably try and fight. I could put up a good one. But the point is moot, since I'm not pirate-minded."

00:38 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Blotto Hendricks messed with a friend of mine, which I do not allow. I put a bounty on him. I did, however, say I would remove it if he gave back her ships, but I would still go after him personally. I also said I would leave him completely alone if he also apologised. He then claimed her ships like a coward as soon as I went to sleep. I challenged him to a duel and he continued hiding."

00:40 [Chatter] Jason Harkness transmits, "He's a butt pirate."

00:40 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "That's the story. 300 mil for him. 100 mil for each of his ships. Long list of people he can be delivered to if I happen to be asleep at the time, but I'll sort it out immediately when awake."

00:42 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Yes. I'm not kidding around. I have always said I would deal strictly with people who fuck with my friends and I am only as good as my word. If I do not handle this as I am doing, I will not be taken seriously. Its about setting a standard."

This polished oaken platform is in the shape of an enormous six-pointed star, each point lashed securely in to place amongst the branches of sturdy trees, keeping the entire structure elevated sixty feet off the ground.

Tiles of white and red marble are placed atop the oaken surface, providing clearly marked pads for both incoming and outbound starships. A sturdy wooden ladder leads down the side of one of the supporting trees.

02:21 [Chatter] Scarlett Recelli transmits, "Anytime, I hope it gets better."

02:21 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.
A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
You must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

02:21 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
[Chatter] Justin Stroup transmits, "How do I go rickety ladder at Tempur."

02:21 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Desolo.

02:21 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:22 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:22 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

Love is to join and separate, to walk alone and together, to find a laughing freedom that lonely isolation does not permit. Love only endures when it moves like waves, receding and returning gently or passionately, or moving lovingly like the tide in the moon's own predictable harmony, because finally, despite scars or fears, they are openly free to be who they really are - and always secretly were. This is what we celebrate today."

Pristine white sand stretches across this shoreline, delicate dunes undulating across the peaceful scape. Foamy waves roll in and out, adding definition and character to the beach with each pass. Prized pieces of seaglass peek out from piles of multicolored shells, and sand-dollars lie sun-drenched atop hillocks of sand. A few sticks of driftwood have been scattered carelessly upon the shore by the waves.

You see nothing special. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus hanging on the wall.
You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a translucent architectural design simulator, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, a red-haired female nanny bot, an orange and white cat, and a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

Hello Taleila,
I hope this epistle finds you adequately healthy to discharge your duties.  I apologize for my tardiness in responding to this matter.  However I have been in a relative state of incapacitation for the past several days due to the more than considerable amount of alcohol I have been consuming.  Upon hearing of your hours-long, heartfelt, offensive and frankly hurtful tyrade directed at me I would be perfectly willing to dual you.  I'm not a worm, I'm just lazy, and a drunk, and I've smoked things that botany textbooks never heard of.  If you want to fight over the way the world works, then we'll have a fighter dual to the escape pod in sector 12 at some point this saturday, or any earlier time at both of our conveniences.  We can discuss the details tomorrow.  I'd just as soon get on with my life, so if you decide that its not worth the loss of your pride, let me know.  But otherwise, on Saturday or some other time before Saturday I'll sure give you what for!  You'll get short shrift from me missy, you hear?  Short, shrift.

You see nothing special. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus hanging on the wall.
You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a translucent architectural design simulator, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, a red-haired female nanny bot, an orange and white cat, and a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

16:15 Allen Robinson's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Forward port cannons loaded. Forward starboard cannons still have ammunition."

16:15 The cannons are already loaded.

16:15 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

16:15 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:15 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:15 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:15 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:15 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:15 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:15 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:15 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:15 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

16:15 A loud rendition of Jingle Bells sounds as orange lights twinkle overhead.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see an oak wood trash bin, a brown leather crewman chair, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northeast.

17:49 Nicholas Prescott's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Give us just a minute and we'll be on our way if everyones okay with that."

17:50 ["Steelwing" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see an oak wood trash bin, a brown leather crewman chair, an internal stun turret, and a food bot in the shape of a rosebud here.
You see Nicole Prescott here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

17:53 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

17:53 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:53 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:53 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

17:53 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:53 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.
