["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood enterta

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood enterta

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

This is our first day of our planned long voyage out of local space. We departed from sector 37 this evening heading galactic Northwest and up. After gaining enough distance that sector 37 was no longer visible on long-range scans, we began heading North and up. We landed on an asteroid 150 light years away from sector 37 after finding a couple of artifacts.

Hello all,
I think everyone agrees that Tom Tucker is a complete pill and doesn't roleplay. He literally acts exactly the same no matter if he is on the Chatter Channel or the OOC channel. Yet he is the first one to go on the OOC channel and whine about someone "breaking roleplay" somehow. Moreover, when he takes his arguments to the OOC channel, he tries to belittle others with immature comments OOCly. Lets make an example of Tom Tucker and others like him by BANNING non-roleplayers and people who generally act like mongoloids and spoil other peoples fun.
Your Supreme Alien Overlord,
The Grundle

Did it ever occure to you that perhaps he just acts how he does in game the same way he may or may not act out of game? Perhaps, by some odd, strange occurance, he is in fact roleplaying, just not in a way that is how everyone else does. Besides, if everyone roleplayed the same way, the game would just be boring. I have learned through incounters with other very, very roleplay intense MUDs, critisizing someone's roleplay style is bad roleplay.

Banning someone just cause they don't rollplay like most is absurd. Tom Tucker is not the only person that may not rp, so therefore how many others need banning? Anyway, this petition is stupid, you can just hang it up.

Everyone seems to have a different style of rp.
So why what he does is such a bad way to rp.

I think that there are a multitude of other individuals who require banning when it comes to this. The person in question isn't bad to some of the other tools I've seen.

The initial post noted by Jason mentions the shattering of OOC and IC. Multiples of us have been
 ignored with triggers by Mister Tom for nothing less than some insults exchanged over OOC, while
 also having links removed (which are IC) as well. I would expect someone who is an expert such as
 himself to understand the difference between OOC and IC, and who supposedly knows how to roleplay.
 I would also expect a roleplay master such as Tom proclaims himself to understand that creating
 ignore triggers shatters the conversation when you only hear half of it, as there's no way that
 your communicator would randomly choose to just not receive messages from people you like who hurt
 your OOC feelings.
This game has become nothing more than a chat room for someone who is a habitual whiner and
 complainer and nothing more. For someone who spends so much of their time and effort critiquing
 others for the separation of OOC and IC (think all the tradesman rants, for example) and talking
 about roleplay, it's pretty clear that the only roleplay Tom knows how to do is complain and use
 socials. The game would lose nothing with his absence and gain much. I'm in favor.

I've never heard him communicate out of character over non ooc channels. And you can't ban someone for having a different opinion to yours on the message boards regarding ignoring etc. To me, this just seems like a way for players who don't like other players or their characters to gather their friends and oust them from the game based on popularity or lack thereof. Regardless of whether or not I like Tom's player, his character, or the things he does and says, this honestly seems petty to me. Unless there have been a bunch of out of character things going on over channels where it is not allowed in the past few weeks during which I have been ofline often. No offense to Jason or Bob, as I have no issues with you or your characters either. I just think it would set a bad standard by which people can be banned for the wrong reasons.

I can understand both sides to this as I try to do wiith every debate. but, everyone makes mistakes. I don't think it's right to ban someone over some mistakes. now if he keeps insulting people, I'd ignore him. if he tells you multiple times to leave you alone, report it to a host if he won't stop. why post it on a message board that you want to ban him? it's wrong.

Plus, he's hardly the only person who insults people. There seems to be a nasty tradition going on where some people are allowed to insult as much as they like, whereas others are not. I also see a double standard in that some people are accused of being whiners if they take issue with how some characters treat their characters, but let the roles just be ever so slightly reversed and they are the ones complaining. I'm not saying that people don't have legitimate reasons to dislike Tom, but I repeat: letting players vote on which other players should be banned is extreme and goes against fair play, in my opinion.

Taleila, you have a very good point. I agree.
Voting people in a negative way, whatever the circumstances, is just not acceptable.
Even if it is for a good reason, I do not like it and I don't think he should be banned. So that's my opinion.
regards, Rory
Your starship-flying friend.

On second thought, I don't know why I bothered responding to this thread, as it is clearly just trolling. I mean, it was started by Fogwell, for heaven's sake.

I agree tooo. I've done mistakes here too for which I'm not proud of and I'd love to reverse them. and make things right. believe everyone, has many chances in life to make things right. If people would just go to the person and tell them. that'd be better than automaticly reporting or making a message to ban someone.

For those newer players who don't know who Fogwell was, he was generally just a giant shit who made other character's lives miserable. He, and other characters like Patrick Fitzpatrick and Dalton what's his name. Good thing they're gone. They were the definition of trolls.

12:49 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

12:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid.

12:50 #$#soundpack_pong

12:50 The computer reports the starship is headed for Asteroid (17, 1, 10). The computer estimates approximately 36 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

12:50 I don't understand that.

12:50 You begin the landing sequence.

12:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

12:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off as the ship sets down on the asteroid's surface.

12:50 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:50 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry w

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
