Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a
bottle of expensive cognac, a white time meter, a cream plastic box labeled
'Space Imager Photos', and Kosmo the humanoid service robot here.
Nathaniel Owens is sleeping on a black leather sectional sofa. Sakura Arakida is

1JILI.42M
We spotted Nebular Signature 0742-0149 and went in for a look. akemi piloted the
ship. We found grade 90 and 100 debris. The luminosity was slightly dim. We
scanned for planets and found none. Signal strength of the torus extra-long
range NDB was at 48 percent.
When we spotted it we had traveled approximately 13.4 ltc from where we
previously stopped and at that time the nebular signature was roughly 24 lgc
away at west and very slightly down.

a Tardick lizard named Raissa
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading RAISSA. Its stomach is bulging, but it
seems content to slowly digest its large meal.
