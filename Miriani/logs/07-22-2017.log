Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, and a white fuzzy artifact storage container here.
You see Miriam Valleris (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

I am both an eviscerator and battlecruiser pilot, and I have fought thousands of praelor ships over my career. Until recently, we could only fight the standard combat drones using our simulators. this left us with an inaccurate representation of how real battles with Praelor ships would feel on all but the smallest of ship types. Now that we have updated software that allows the addition of up to ten different custom drone configurations, I have come up with what I believe to be accurate drone configurations to simulate Praelor ships using our simulators. It is important that we get an accurate feel for how things will be if we are going to practice for the day we have our own ships, whatever the types we might choose to use to defend our space from the Praelor Ontanka faction, and to strike aggressively at them. to that end, here is my list of drone names and configuration settings for many of the Praelor ship types. If anyone believes my settings to be in error, I invite them to come up with changes. It is important that pilots of all alliances work together.

-----------------------------------------

I am both an eviscerator and battlecruiser pilot, and I have fought thousands of praelor ships over my career. Until recently, we could only fight the standard combat drones using our simulators. this left us with an inaccurate representation of how real battles with Praelor ships would feel on all but the smallest of ship types. Now that we have updated software that allows the addition of up to ten different custom drone configurations, I have come up with what I believe to be accurate drone configurations to simulate Praelor ships using our simulators. It is important that we get an accurate feel for how things will be if we are going to practice for the day we have our own ships, whatever the types we might choose to use to defend our space from the Praelor Ontanka faction, and to strike aggressively at them. to that end, here is my list of drone names and configuration settings for many of the Praelor ship types. If anyone believes my settings to be in error, I invite them to come up with changes. It is important that pilots of all alliances work together.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, and a white fuzzy artifact storage container here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, and a white fuzzy artifact storage container here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
