My Dearest Love,
This exchange took place and so believe what you want but you
yourself should checkout the facts and not from her as she is
obviously on the defensive but she has nothing worthwhile to
defend. I don't have time for her lies and mis-representations.
I'd end up deleting her link in a matter of minutes I'm sure..
She sure didn't sound very convincing when she said she didn't like
Fawkes and wow are you just naive. It's just amazing now that you
are so thick-headed.
These are the statements I received via Private about your mistress. Again you are in the worst case of denial because you are too afraid to admit it that you've made a very extremely poor judgement call in terms of trying to ditch me for a slut. Oh by the way, she did not help you the other day prior to the loss of your gunship and related. It was Amy who rescued you two and not her so don't mis-represent things. She is not your angel of rescue she can mouth all she wants to but I'm not the only one who sees through her lies and deceptions.
Here are the statements I heard myself and which were officially recorded on my communicator. You can't obtain anything more authentic than that!
[Private "yeah she's well...... going around with alot of guys"
(12-34 p.m.) [Private | "thanks i dont doubt if they are playing
him"
(12-42 p.m.) [Private | "trust me i'm not the only that thinks
it just
not much want to say"
(12-45 p.m.) [Private | 
00:08 "yes he has which has me surprised why
he

Kitty,
Again, you are making no sense. My point in bringing up the fact that I got my tranny back is to point out that not all of your information is correct or complete. You were still under the impression that I had lost it and that Fawkes had it in his possession. See, your problem is that you  heard the first part of the story, but didn't ask questions about the rest. You assumed and jumped to conclusions. So, if that information was incorrect, it follows that other information you give me could be flawed. If the person you got your information that Miriam sleeps around is the person I'm thinking of, then you don't know her side of the story. How fair is that? It's also someone who you claimed got me in trouble before and now you want to believe him. Seems someone isn't thinking with their head either.
Aside from humanity and it's existence and it's right to live, there are very few things I will defend with my life or my entire being. The right for people to defend their dignity and have their story heard. Too many events in history and in life have gone wrong because someone didn't listen to both sides of the story. It isn't fair, nor just and it is something I will not tolerate. It's judgmental to listen to half of the story and ignore the rest simply because you are angry.
This has nothing to do with whom I am dating. If people were saying things behind your back, even as much as I am angry at you right now, I believe you have the right to explain yourself and to defend your side. Yet, you don't allow others the same right. I cannot and will not be with someone who treats people that unfairly. Yes, you have the right to your opinion, but your opinion should be portrayed as just that, an opinion. Statements made in your letters were portrayed as factual. This is where it become defaming. It's one thing to say I believe someone is a thief. That would be an opinion. However, the moment you say that a person is a thief without tangible evidence, it becomes defamation of character and it is not something I will tolerate around me.
As to the name of the house, I could care less what you called it. I was just trying to warn you that they heard you insulted it. According to them, if you insult their house, you insult them too. I was just trying to warn you, but seems you aren't willing to listen to any reason either. So, at this point, further conversation is pointless. You believe you're right and refuse to listen to the whole story. You are willing to obtain information from biased sources and use only what will suit your purposes.
You know, the reasons I left you go beyond sex and affection. It was also about how you handle disagreements, refuse to listen, over react, and get angry easily because I happen to ask too many questions. You almost turned our last trip out of locals around because I dared to question you. If you had simply 
00:51 explained why a given rule was there, I would have understood, but instead, you threatened to turn the ship around
No, I didn't feel comfortable talking to you about affection or my problems with us not being intimate because I was afraid you would get angry. Life is too short and too hard to be uncomfortable with the one you love. I'm sorry Kitty, but any chances of us getting back together have vanished. I wish you the best in your endeavors.
Tibo

Kitty,
Again, you are making no sense. My point in bringing up the fact that I got my tranny back is to point out that not all of your information is correct or complete. You were still under the impression that I had lost it and that Fawkes had it in his possession. See, your problem is that you  heard the first part of the story, but didn't ask questions about the rest. She only gave me 450 million because I wouldn't let her give me more. You assumed and jumped to conclusions. So, if that information was incorrect, it follows that other information you give me could be flawed. If the person you got your information from that Miriam sleeps around is the person I'm thinking of, then you don't know her side of the story. How fair is that? It's also someone who you claimed got me in trouble before and now you want to believe him. Seems someone isn't thinking with their head either.
Actually, there is something more authentic than communicator chatter. It's called first hand knowledge. You should try it some time. First of all, Amy was not in my gunship, trying to repair it and move it. When Fawkes docked with my gunship, it was Miriam who moved my gunship away from his ship. You see, this is more authentic. I was a witness to it. Yes, Amy  may have shown up in Ryan's BC, but it was Ryan's BC that saved us the first time and I didn't call for him. I don't even have a link with him. If I didn't call for him, then who did? He never responded over General. I'm not misrepresenting things. What I said was that she proved that she wasn't out to steal my ship then. She did fire on both of them and move my ship to try to keep it from being destroyed longer. You, and the other person, were probably not privy to the sector communication that took place either and again, this is proof that you refuse to consider all of the facts. You just focus on the facts that you want to.
Aside from humanity and it's existence and it's right to live, there are very few things I will defend with my life or my entire being. The right for people to defend their dignity and have their story heard. Too many events in history and in life have gone wrong because someone didn't listen to both sides of the story. It isn't fair, nor just and it is something I will not tolerate. It's judgmental to listen to half of the story and ignore the rest simply because you are angry.
This has nothing to do with whom I am dating. If people were saying things behind your back, even as much as I am angry at you right now, I believe you have the right to explain yourself and to defend your side. Yet, you don't allow others the same right. I cannot and will not be with someone who treats people that unfairly. 
Yes, you have the right to your opinion, but your opinion should be portrayed as just that, an opinion. Statements made in your letters were portrayed as factual. This is where it become defaming. It's one thing to say I believe someone is a thief. That would be an opinion. However, the moment you say that a person is a thief without tangible evidence, it becomes defamation of character and it is not something I will tolerate around me.
As to the name of the house, I could care less what you called it. I was just trying to warn you that they heard you insulted it. According to them, if you insult their house, you insult them too. I was just trying to warn you, but seems you aren't willing to listen to any reason either. So, at this point, further conversation is pointless. You believe you're right and refuse to listen to the whole story. You are willing to obtain information from biased sources and use only what will suit your purposes. If you don't have time to listen to all of the facts and give others the right to defend their side of the story, then I'm not going to give you the opportunity to defend your side of the story. then maybe, just maybe, someday when you need people to listen to your side, people won't listen either and maybe you'll know how it feels not to be listened to or be given an opportunity to share your side.
You know, the reasons I left you go beyond sex and affection. It was also about how you handle disagreements, refuse to listen, over react, and get angry easily because I happen to ask too many questions. You almost turned our last trip out of locals around because I dared t
01:15 o question you. If you had simply explained why a given rule was there, I would have understood, but instead, you threatened to turn the ship around.
No, I didn't feel comfortable talking to you about affection or my problems with us not being intimate because I was afraid you would get angry. I figured that you'd just say that you weren't comfortable yet and you needed more time. I don't believe it would have changed anything. Life is too short and too hard to be uncomfortable with the one you love. I'm sorry Kitty, but any chances of us getting back together have vanished. I wish you the best in your future endeavors.

Kitty,
Again, you are making no sense. My point in bringing up the fact that I got my tranny back is to point out that not all of your information is correct or complete. You were still under the impression that I had lost it and that Fawkes had it in his possession. See, your problem is that you  heard the first part of the story, but didn't ask questions about the rest. She only gave me 450 million because I wouldn't let her give me more. You assumed and jumped to conclusions. So, if that information was incorrect, it follows that other information you give me could be flawed. If the person you got your information from that Miriam sleeps around is the person I'm thinking of, then you don't know her side of the story. How fair is that? It's also someone who you claimed got me in trouble before and now you want to believe him. Seems someone isn't thinking with their head either.
Actually, there is something more authentic than communicator chatter. It's called first hand knowledge. You should try it some time. First of all, Amy was not in my gunship, trying to repair it and move it. When Fawkes docked with my gunship, it was Miriam who moved my gunship away from his ship. You see, this is more authentic. I was a witness to it. Yes, Amy  may have shown up in Ryan's BC, but it was Ryan's BC that saved us the first time and I didn't call for him. I don't even have a link with him. If I didn't call for him, then who did? He never responded over General. I'm not misrepresenting things. What I said was that she proved that she wasn't out to steal my ship then. She did fire on both of them and move my ship to try to keep it from being destroyed longer. You, and the other person, were probably not privy to the sector communication that took place either and again, this is proof that you refuse to consider all of the facts. You just focus on the facts that you want to.
Aside from humanity and it's existence and it's right to live, there are very few things I will defend with my life or my entire being. The right for people to defend their dignity and have their story heard. Too many events in history and in life have gone wrong because someone didn't listen to both sides of the story. It isn't fair, nor just and it is something I will not tolerate. It's judgmental to listen to half of the story and ignore the rest simply because you are angry.
This has nothing to do with whom I am dating. If people were saying things behind your back, even as much as I am angry at you right now, I believe you have the right to explain yourself and to defend your side. Yet, you don't allow others the same right. I cannot and will not be with someone who treats people that unfairly. 
Yes, you have the right to your opinion, but your opinion should be portrayed as just that, an opinion. Statements made in your letters were portrayed as factual. This is where it become defaming. It's one thing to say I believe someone is a thief. That would be an opinion. However, the moment you say that a person is a thief without tangible evidence, it becomes defamation of character and it is not something I will tolerate around me.
As to the name of the house, I could care less what you called it. I was just trying to warn you that they heard you insulted it. According to them, if you insult their house, you insult them too. I was just trying to warn you, but seems you aren't willing to listen to any reason either. So, at this point, further conversation is pointless. You believe you're right and refuse to listen to the whole story. You are willing to obtain information from biased sources and use only what will suit your purposes. If you don't have time to listen to all of the facts and give others the right to defend their side of the story, then I'm not going to give you the opportunity to defend your side of the story. then maybe, just maybe, someday when you need people to listen to your side, people won't listen either and maybe you'll know how it feels not to be listened to or be given an opportunity to share your side.
You know, the reasons I left you go beyond sex and affection. It was also about how you handle disagreements, refuse to listen, over react, and get angry easily because I happen to ask too many questions. You almost turned our last trip out of locals around because I dared t
11:50 o question you. If you had simply explained why a given rule was there, I would have understood, but instead, you threatened to turn the ship around.
No, I didn't feel comfortable talking to you about affection or my problems with us not being intimate because I was afraid you would get angry. I figured that you'd just say that you weren't comfortable yet and you needed more time. I don't believe it would have changed anything. Life is too short and too hard to be uncomfortable with the one you love. I'm sorry Kitty, but any chances of us getting back together have vanished. I wish you the best in your future endeavors.

If I didn't call for him, then who did? He never responded over General. 
I'm not misrepresenting things. I never said that she was my rescuing angel. What I said was that she proved that she wasn't out to steal my ship then. I watched her every move on the internal stun turret cameras. She did fire on both of them and move my ship to try to keep it from being destroyed longer. You, and the other person, were probably not privy to the sector communication that took place either and again, this is proof that you refuse to consider all of the facts. You just focus on the facts that you want to.
What you don't know about the second attack is that we spent half the morning making Cria chase us around. It was Miriam's idea that had Cria jumping into the wrong sector at times. If she was really in league with him, why didn't she just tell him to jump to the sector I had started to jump to? He jumped back to the original sector and not to the new one I jumped to. Why didn't she just  have him wait in orbit when we launched and have him ready to shoot down my ship or have it all blockaded or what not? None of this happened. It would have been much easier and Miriam would have gotten paid so much faster if she had just led Cria to the sectors we planned to jump to, but Cria was never there and often took a couple of minutes to figure out where we had jumped to. Obviously, he got bad information or none at all.
According to the private communication transcripts you sent, Miriam is sleeping around with a lot of guys. This is in the present form as in it's happening right now. Yet, she has always been next to me except that one time to go fix my hatch on my Transverser. So obviously, do I believe what I see firsthand or what someone else says that they don't see  firsthand? I don't see her leaving to sleep with other people right now. Now if you had video recordings of her leaving while I am asleep or something to that degree, that would be tangible, authentic evidence. Hearsay is not. I also heard her ex-boyfriend through my droid basically tell her that they couldn't avoid each other forever. So obviously, he got the message that it's over. She didn't know where he was or that I had that particular droid remote in my hand.
Aside from humanity and it's existence and it's right to live, there are very few things I will defend with my life or my entire being.

You see a gigantic marble fireplace with a marble harth and a wooden mantel, a metal queen-sized water bed with wrought-iron rose vines trailing up each post, a tall rectangular polished oak nightstand, a small oval shining oak bedside table, a large midnight blue Persian rug, a cherry wood trash bin, a pair of sexy black suede strappy heeled sandals with sparkling gems adorning the straps, and a pair of brown leather tennis shoes here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a metal queen-sized water bed with wrought-iron rose vines trailing up each post) here, sleeping.
