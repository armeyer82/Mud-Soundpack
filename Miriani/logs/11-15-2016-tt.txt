Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Living Quarters Two]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt
on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a large oval dark
purple and light purple cloth rug, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy
seashell pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and
Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new

A small snail glides effortlessly across the inner surface of the glass.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and
shrapnel.
[PA] Johann Rowan: "Ahh, nothing like wine first thing to wake up!"
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Be right there."

Lily Kaise glides out.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black upholstered
sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry
trash bin, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an
insulated green cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a red plastic food storage
container, a small blue ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Kiwi

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's fine."
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from the south.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But yeah, I don't plan on staying in for
long."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We both still want to hunt for alien
artifacts for the org so it would be fine. Only reason I brought up Sea of Fears
is that you were going for the Docking bay upgrade and then onto Tom Town for
the Thermal. It would have worked out well with Sea of Fears being so close by.
Still Hall of Pain is closer so that would work. Would be great to have a
recharge station though."
Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo rubs up against Blueberry the hefty
violet feathered felo, and both animals purr softly.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Aww."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "How cute."
Johann Rowan grins.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "That is true."
Lily Kaise strokes the soft feathers of Blueberry the hefty violet feathered
felo.
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's
hand, looking up at her adoringly.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Shame you can't fit a module scout in the
bay."
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo.
Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo purrs softly.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well there is that upgrade to convert
the docking bay of a Galleon to hold modules but then you lose the docking bay
capacity."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, I would rather have a docking bay."
Lily Kaise nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Maybe a fort for the medical bay, but I
would prefer a docking bay."
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah but how often are you going to need
a fort while artifacting."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "You're not, but it would be nice to get
healed."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "If something were to happen."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I guess you mean if you put a fort
aboard, then you could take it to GMG as well."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Nah, say you're on an expedition and
someone gets a concussion or something somehow."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "You could use the fort to heal."
Johann Rowan exclaims in a German accent, "Aha! 94!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah but out of all of the LTC I have
traveled, the only injury I've ever received was on a fridge that Akemi bolted
and it was just a minor bruise."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Again that is so unlikely."
Lily Kaise grins.
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Never say never. Just saying I wouldn't
get rid of my docking bay for a fort for the almost non-chance that one could
become injured."
Johann Rowan grins.
Lily Kaise grins.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I wonde rif you could modify it depending
on your expedition."
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo rubs up against a mahogany coffee
table, purring softly.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So for one, take the modules, for another
a docking bay."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Granted, I agree a docking bay is much
more useful."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We went way beyond 1000 last fall and on
this last trip at least 1000 and I've been on a couple others that long."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Oh so you're saying you'd invest in
another Galleon?"
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Oh no, this was expensive enough."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But if you could bring it over for the
refit depending on your expedition profile, that could be useful."
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo stares curiously up at Johann Rowan.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo stares curiously up at Lily Kaise.
Johann Rowan grins at Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo.
Johann Rowan gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders out.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and blue round wings stares
in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.
A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils

THINGS THAT EVERY PILOT KNOWS
About life in general...
* Known Space is the sphere of space that humanity has explored, roughly
centered, for obvious reasons, around Old Earth.
* Humanity has expanded to many worlds within Known Space, and has built several
large space stations for various purposes.
* Several alien artifacts also exist, and almost seem to have been left on
purpose. One of these, The Torus, is settled by humans too.
* Very few worlds and space stations are independent, but rather have banded
together into groups reflecting their common interests. These groups are known
generally simply as "alliances," and are roughly equivalent to what sovereign
nations were on Old Earth. There are five alliances currently recognized in
Known Space.
* Generally, each alliance maintains a "pilot league," which is a special group
of citizens granted licenses allowing them to operate starships for the benefit
of their alliance. The pilot league is civilian, but alliances also maintain a
separate military presence in space.
* Every person in Known Space is a citizen of whichever alliance they were born
into (with the exception of unregistered persons). Switching citizenship is
rare.
* Most citizens are not pilots and rarely leave the world they call home. People
from other alliances, and by extension the pilots that interact freely with
these people, are not entirely trusted.
* The currency in Known Space is the credit: a unit of electronic currency. Of
the currencies that were in use immediately before the Standard Credit, the U.S.
Dollar and the Euro come the closest to being equivalent to its value.
About life as a pilot...
* Pilots have a special relationship with their alliance. They receive vast sums
of money and the opportunity to go into space, in return for making money for
their alliance and a lonely existence with most of their rights as citizens
stripped away.
* Pilots of most alliances must pass a course from a flight school before being
granted a license. This takes about two years. Mutuality pilots have no formal
licensing requirement, though 9th Fleet pilots are granted an equivalent to a
license.
* Pilots are distrusted by the average citizen, not only because of their
frequent contact with other alliances, but also because of their vast wealth,
which can destabilize local economies on some planets.
* Pilots are barred from visiting most locations on a planet, even, often, their
former homes.
* Even though pilots earn vast sums of credits, they are in fact paying roughly
a 95% tax rate, the vast majority of their earnings going to their alliance.
This is the price for the ability to fly in space.
* Because pilots are so wealthy, many stores where pilots shop inflate their
prices by a factor of several thousand.
* Because becoming a pilot tends to cut one off for other people, pilots in
general tend to be loners, and only rarely engage in long-term relationships.
Pilot families are rare.
* Alliances consider their pilots extremely valuable and have done their best to
make starships as perfectly safe as possible. Each starship has a rescue pod
that will save the crew in the moments before destruction. Failure of these
rescue pods is extremely, almost impossibly rare. The only known instance of
rescue pods not arriving at the landing pad in the past 150 years is during a
handful of the fiercer battles of the Outsider War.
* Most pilots will be regarded by the average citizen as something of a
scoundrel, and are likely to be depicted thus by the media whenever the chance
arises. Heroism is recognized too, however, and some pilots can become minor
celebrities, almost household names, especially aces and particularly renowned
office-holders.
About the alliances...
* The League of Old Earth Democracies, or League, is considered ancient and
traditional, descended directly from the pre-colonization governments of the
homeworld. It is also considered by many to be overburdened by its old laws and
massive wealth.
* The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions, or AEU, is the result of humanity's initial
colonization effort during a period of great exploration and discovery. It still
values those ideals. Detractors consider the AEU's goals too lofty and
idealistic, and not sufficiently practical to deal with the realities of
humanity's presence in space.
* The Egalitarian Alliance of Sentients, or EAOS, is in fact only a human
chapter of a much larger Galactic EAOS. It was formed on the advice of text-only
communications left behind in the massive alien artifact known as The Torus, but
the purpose behind these instructions remains unclear. The EAOS currently
attracts many of the finest minds in Known Space. Enemies of the EAOS believe
that its superior technological capabilities have given the alliance a certain
air of elitism, and a degree of power over other alliances disproportionate to
its size. The EAOS' permanent citizens in fact maintain dual citizenship with
their alliance of origin. The EAOS has no pilot league of its own, but rather
appoints exceptional pilots from other alliances.
* The Confederation of Fringe Worlds, or Fringe, has its origin in the second
great wave of colonization. These are the most recently settled worlds, and the
poorest. Its members value above all the ability to simple eke out some kind of
survival on the edge of Known Space. Other alliances often dislike the Fringe
because of its casual attitude toward piracy and other less scrupulous
activities.
* The Sovereign Mutuality of Disparate Freemen, or Mutuality, is the mostly
recently recognized alliance, only acknowledged after offering aid during the
Resistance. It has its origin in a group of so-called "unregistered" people, who
lived outside Known Space and had allegiance to no alliance. Aside from
achieving official recognition, this group is largely unchanged, and is often
not trusted by the other alliances due to their long enmity with the
unregistered people.
* Other isolated groups exist, such as the Spinward Clans and Feng Wo
Collective, but these are not formally recognized alliances and tend to be
lumped together under the label "unregistered," just as the Mutuality was not so
many years ago. These are, however, individual and distinct cultures.
* The Allied Pirates also exist, seemingly a well-funded and well-organized
group that works against the alliances. Unlike past rebel groups, it is widely
believed that they draw their members principally from the alliances rather than
the unregistered. Their true agenda is not widely known, but is believed to be
the simple seizing of wealth and power.
About Known Space and its planets...
* The most populated planets of the League are Old Earth, Mars, Luna, Centauri,
Vesta, Callisto, in roughly that order.
* The most populated planets of the AEU are New Earth, Hyperion, Telex, Bikura,
Endymion, Aenea, in roughly that order.
* The most populated planets of the Fringe are Chetumal, Candelaria, Ars Magna,
Cardenas, Champoton, Tenosque, Tikal, Ticul, Pital, Frontera, Ardsley, in
roughly that order.
* The EAOS has no planets, but people can live on The Torus and the Residential
Structure.
* The Mutuality also has no planets, and people live on an unknown number of
large space stations.
About aliens...
* The Jinu were encountered first. They are vaguely humanoid and friendly to
humans. They have somewhat more advanced technology than humans. Humanity was
cut off from contact with them during the Outsider War, and they have not been
heard from since.
* The Outsiders were encountered next. They are unfriendly beings with an
insatiable desire to control everything around them.
* The Interstellar Federation of Species is also known, but they have not yet
been seen in the flesh. They are enemies of humans and Jinu.
* The Galactic Egalitarian Alliance of Sentients is one or more unknown alien
species with highly advanced technology. The human alliance called the EAOS was
formed based on text-only communication with the discoverers of The Torus.
* The Children of the Sun are a client species of the Outsiders, often called
Battle Thralls. They are superficially dinosaur-like beings with a strange
crystalline exoskeleton. While many remain committed to fighting humans on the
Outsiders' orders, a sizable faction is negotiating with the human alliances in
the hopes of allying and achieving independence.
* Other unknown alien species are sometimes encountered in deep space, or at
least the evidence of them, but virtually nothing is known of them.
About starships...
* Immediately after the Outsider War, starships were much more poorly designed
than they had been in the past, with all Jinu technology and even much human
technology now lost.
* Starship technology and industrial infrastructure is beginning to recover,
making larger starship models and more advanced technology more common, but much
is still lost, sometimes replaced by cruder alternatives.
* Wormhole jumps are once again quite violent for the people inside, without the
Jinu stabilization technology.
* Chainguns (created by the Mutuality) and plasma minicannons (created by the
EAOS) are new weapons created during the Outsider War.
* A capital ship is considered to be any ship large enough to require a crew;
i.e., larger than a battlecruiser. An individual capital ship tends to be a
well-known name among pilots, as only a small handful of capital ships are
produced per each class. For instance, everyone knows that the Leviathan is one
of the very few juggernaut-class capital ships ever built.
* Juggernauts had crews numbering in the hundreds. Carriers could theoretically
be run with a skeleton crew, but fully crewed would have around a hundred.
Battleships had a crew numbering anywhere from twenty-five to fifty.
* Larger ships generally required Jinu assistance to build. Notable exceptions
include the Renegade-constructed battlecruisers, and some later-model
battleship-sized ships (which tended to be overall inferior to a battlecruiser).
* Juggernauts required Outsider intervention to construct.
About the recent past...
* The Outsider War affected everyone in the past decade, with the vast majority
of humanity's resources once being fed directly to the Outsiders. The Outsiders
succeeded in breaking in the collective spirit of humanity, and nearly everyone
alive feels this to some degree.
* The whereabouts of the great juggernaut "Leviathan," a hero of pre-War battles
against the IFS, are unknown. The ship has acquired an almost mythical status in
the years since the last sighting.
* Several capital ships were constructed by the Coalition prior to its
disbanding. At least one was fully completed and flown in battle, only to be
apparently stolen by unregistered pilots upon the Coalition's abdication.
* Capital ships smaller than carriers, generally classified as battleships, were
produced by the Coalition and the alliances. These ships were universally
warships, as opposed to carriers, which had a more logistical position. Few of
these exist, and none are space worthy.
* Many of these capital ships lacked advanced technology such as subwarp,
improved interdiction subsystems, long range lasers, etc.
* Reconstruction is well underway these days, though there is still much to do.
Experts predict that it will be decades before the collective economy fully
recovers. The Outsider occupation was an apocalyptic event, and its effects will
resound through history even if the Outsiders suddenly vanish right this moment.

During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I
would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written
statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which
didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to
consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU
seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in
his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on
to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship
was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when
I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very
apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of
Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of
the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very
gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurry not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was
in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans
of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather
Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have
hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

A medium-sized semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic
statue of Benjamin Masterson.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok I don't readily recognize this
particular asteroid cluster."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
'Niether do I.
You say, "Niether do I."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We're in Known Space though so we're
doing something right."
Lily Kaise grins.

Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo approaches a glossy black ceramic felo
chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into
its mouth.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Johann Rowan grins at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise grins at Johann Rowan.
Johann Rowan glances down at his watch momentarily.
A medium-length black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears
up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked Buran-class rift galleon and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders south.
Johann Rowan quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
It's not always about where you're going.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 90.0, 0.0.
You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?
A long black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked Buran-class rift galleon and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
A long black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then

-lily I should go to sleep in about a half an hour or so.
You say to Lily, "I should go to sleep in about a half an hour or so."
Remember what I said.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok Love."
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
Johann Rowan nods to you.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I wish Akemi would have made that second
hypercast."
Johann Rowan shrugs.
Lily Kaise nods.
Johann Rowan activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.
Johann Rowan exclaims in a German accent, "OH, what I would give for a landmark
I recognize!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That makes two or three of us if Shule
is not too dozey yet."
Lily Kaise grins.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
grin
You grin.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Just for fun, I want to try something."
Johann Rowan presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Johann Rowan presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Johann Rowan flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control
board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Ahh, no luck."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
A readout shows Asteroid Cluster 4236-7011 about 14.27 light-grand cycles toward
Galactic Westsouthwest and Very Slightly Up.
locate
You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem overwhelmingly loud. The signal strength meter reads: 96%.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "NDB was 98 when we left Campeche."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Was it? I saw it at 99 when I checked."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Hmm ok then maybe that was the first
time I checked."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I made sure to check right when we
engaged the drive."
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "That's assuming though that we come back
near a Fringe cluster."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It could be some other one."
Johann Rowan nods.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sheer pale pink silk chemise. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a light purple flightbag
with a pastel kitten on the side. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps,

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

[Starship "Kiera Wolfe"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Kalina"; Docking Bay.

[Starship "Kiera Wolfe"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is at Starship "Kalina"; Docking Bay.

Farport Upgrades:
Luminosity Sensor 50000000.00 (Farport Into the black)
Requirements: 250 exploration points
This sensor basically tells you how bright a certain area of space is, and
whether or not using solar panels if you're planning to build a station in that
immediate vicinity with a solar-powered power plant would be a good idea.
Obviously, any area that is below sol-level luminosity would probably not be a
good spot to set up a solar panel-powered station at.
Low-Level Rift Notification Override 60000000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
Requirements: 400 exploration points.
This upgrade can be installed on any ship that is not an exploration-type ship.
It basically works with the scientific sensor rigging. To explain further, the
scientific sensor rigging finds new points of interest, but doesn't actually
tell you that it's found new points of interest if you are flying in a ship
that's not designated as an exploration vessel. You'll have to keep checking the
rift locations continuously to even know that they're there. This upgrade
however will alert you anytime your non-exploration ship finds anything of
interest as you're traveling through the riftflow. I assume that scientific
sensor rigging has to be installed for this to work.
Active Long-Range Scanner 100000000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
Requirements: 650 exploration points.
This upgrade, which was provided to us by the Marzore clan, allows a ship to
send active pings out into space. These active pings will allow you to locate
any starships within the scanner's range and track them for a short amount of
time. Any ship that's pinged by this upgrade will be able to track the last
known location of that ping regardless of whether they have that upgrade or not.
Rift Drive Impeller 500000000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
Requirements: 750 exploration points.
By all indications, the Rift Drive impeller seems to add an extra speed boost to
the drive by ensuring that it always moves at a certain minimum speed. I haven't
really noticed anything else regarding it however aside from the fact that it
can only be installed on exploration-type ships. Also, the impeller cannot be
installed on any exploration ships that have been outfitted with a sensor
dampener, charged shot or ablative armor.
Long-Range Hypercaster 175000000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
requirements: 850 exploration points
This upgrade requires the long-range scanner in order to be used. It basically
allows long-range communication between ships that are farther out. If you
increase the power or antenna gain, your comm range will increase to even
farther out, but you'll be transmitting at a much narrower distance unless the
angle of transmition to the ships you are near is pretty spot on. Larger ships,
ships with scientific sensor riggings and ships with exploration arrays have a
more increased transmition distance than the average vessel. Note: if you use
the hypercaster your sensor signature will be easier to track by other ships for
a short amount of time.
Planetary Surveyor 600000000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
Requirements: 1000 exploration points.
This upgrade, which was also provided by the Marzor clan, will allow you to
survey any planetary systems you might come across while exploring for any
planetary bodies. the rewards for finding a planet are 250 million credits, and
an as of yet undetermined number of exploration points, since I didn't fix my
contributions before I tested it with previously discovered planets.
Hypercaster Calibration Rigging 17,500,000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
Requirements: 1100 exploration points.
This upgrade is an upgrade to the hypercaster's software, so obviously, you'll
need to have the hypercaster installed before you install this particular
upgrade. It basically sends a carrier signal out to any ships you're trying to
talk to, telling them your present antenna and power settings. It's used to help
in getting clearer transmitions.
High-Capacity Low-Output Energy Storage System 625,000,000.00 (Farport Into The
Black)
Requirements: 1750 exploration points.
This upgrade seems to make the battery last approximately 50% longer than it
might normally be able to, by minimizing the draw from a ship's power systems.
So, it incraeses your ship's power. However, there are drawbacks. From what I've
seen so far, your ship's maximum speed decreases with this upgrade installed, as
well as the power of your weapon damage points. The rift speed also seems to
decrease, though that has not been fully proven, but did need to be mentioned in
case. Sensors also seem to take a hit, especially when inside the riftflow, as
does communication via hypercast. Finally, this upgrade can only be fitted on a
light cruiser or larger vessel.
Fusion Blast Chamber 750000000.00 (Farport Into The Black)
Requirements: 2000 exploration points.
This upgrade allows ships of certain sizes (current estimation is light cruiser
or larger) to recharge using debris as fuel. It works like old-fashion steam
ships that use to need people shoveling coal into their chambers for fuel. In
this instance though, one has to shovel debris. That is probably the most
annoying part of using the blast chamber, because you'll likely have to shovel
continuously while it's active. There are three different settings to the blast
chamber: slow, medium and fast. Each will recharge your ship at a better rate
depending on which setting you use, but they'll also burn through more fuel in a
shorter amount of time. Finally, the last thing you need to look out for
regarding the blast chamber is its wear level, which cannot be repaired anywhere
but at a repair and rearm shop. So, if you happen to find yourself out in the
vast distances at critically low power and a furnace that's over 90% wear,
you'll probably not be getting back without taking a pod ride, one way or the
other.
Hyperdimensional Rift Condition Forecaster 600,000,000.00 (Farport Into the
Black)
Requirements: 2500 exploration points.
This upgrade will tell you how the riftflow is going to be in the next little
while. Best guess is it can foresee rift conditions up to only about an hour
ahead. It doesn't by any means replace a rift forecaster station, but it does
have its own uses. It can only be installed on ships that as far as I've
deduced, have the scientific sensor rigging, exploration-grade sensors and don't
have combat sensors (like sensor dampener) though the tech did seem to hint that
there was another requirement, he just didn't seem to remember what it was.
Note: speak to the tech at the shop for further information regarding all of
these upgrades.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: Regarding the Voice of the Corps
Author: Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth
Posted: 20:39 15 November 2316 GST

To the Corps,
Recently, this office received several letters regarding Voice of the Corps Lily
Kaise and her refusal to return home to perform her duties at the request of her
fellow pilots. We agree that this is not in keeping with the duties and
responsibilities that go with this position. More importantly, however, given
the current reality of our small corps, even just a couple of letters requesting
a recall represent a supermajority of the pilots still active and engaged here
at home.
For these reasons, this office has decided to immediately remove Lily Kaise from
the position of Voice and begin seeking her replacement. If you are interested
in taking this position yourself, please post here. We hope to have this
position filled again very soon.
Andrew Lambeth
Liaison to the Civilian Corps

Hello,
I would be interested in taking up the duties of voice. My only slight problem
is that I currently already hold the office of industrial whip. How does this
work?

While i agree that the office of Voice of the Corps is a necessity for being
representat, I want to add that my response to Melinda Michaels was not properly
represented. I did not actually refuse to return. Melinda Michaels left Famous
Andy's Trading Post before I could properly respond. I will post the actual
transcript of the conversation between Michaels and myself and details shortly.
i also have a copy off the letter which Michaels sent to Ather Jammoa which was
a glossed over mis-representation of what I actually expressed. I was not
traveling in my own ship and i had to consider the Ship Captain's preference as
well. I will also add that Melinda Michaels had no expressed support from either
Ather Jammoa nor Kim Saunders or any other AEU pilot that there were matters
here. All that was conveyed to us were there were news reports of citizens from
other alliances being injured or killed by AEU citizens which is indeed a
representation of crimes against humanity. This was a pilot from the League and
not a pilot from the AEU. I actually had more questions of Melinda Michaels and
wanted to prepare a written statement for her to bring back as well but Michaels
abruptly left without giving me much of an opportunity to fully respond to my
own alliance as well as to others. I had no other means to communicate to anyone
in Communications Range as Johann Rowan's Galleon is not yet equipped with a
Quantum Entanglement Device. I have returned and I am willing to resume my
responsibilities if possible. Thank you for this consideration. I will look
forward to serving our great alliance again. Respectfully, Lily Kaise

SEAS will be more than pleased to support a salvage processing station in
Artifact 777. We have enough industry to provide a better processor than what is
currently being supported. If any other organizations are interested as you will
earn income, please send me a note by mail as I will not apply modules from
anyone who doesn't express their interest. - Lily Kaise

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You can go north and down.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You can go south, up, and out.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light purple shipsuit with purple trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.
Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a metallic gold touch einrophone in her right hand.

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello all, I am sure everyone is fully up to
date on what has been happening in the past few days. As your new voice, I think
it's important we get together in a meeting and talk about various aspects of
our alliance in general, and our pilot core specificly. Even though we may not
have control on what people do, we should maybe at least make a statement with
regards to the recent violence. Lily's proposal for medical care of those in
need is also still on the table for discussion, and during these tough times we
should probably discuss what we can do to make our pilot core great again. This,
and any other concerns should best be talked over face to face. I invite you all
for a meeting. I will allow 24 hours for people to suggest dates, but I think we
should try to organize it somewhere within the next week or so. Write me a
letter, call my office number or just talk to me on comms. The message board
under debate is also a good location to write with topics of discussion you may
wish to bring up. Let's try to work together and change the image our pilot core
currently has for the better. Thank you. Kim Saunders. [21:16 16 November 2316

Subject: Setting up a meeting
Author: Kim Saunders
Posted: 21:44 16 November 2316 GST
--
Hello all,
for those of you who have missed my earlier comm notice, I would like to
organize a meeting to discuss several things important to our pilot core.
1. How can we respond to the recent outbreak of violence against members of the
other alliances?
2. Are we still interested in, and if so, how can we assist with better medical
centre access to the poor in need.
3. What direction would we like our pilot core to go in, how can we change our
image, work together, find our self respect? The future is uncertain, even
though our new president has promised renewed support for our pilot core. There
are so few of us.
4. Any other subjects you may find important to discuss, provided we will have
the time.
I will allow 24 hours for you to suggest times and dates, before I will make the
date for this meeting known. I do feel we should try to organize it somewhere
within the next week though.
For any comments, questions, concerns, ideas, proposals or dates for this
meeting, or anything else that you consider relevant, I invite you to post on
the board, write me a letter or call my office on number 0010-16336.
I am looking forward to working with you all and to a productive meeting. I wish
you a nice day.

Subject: Setting up a meeting
Author: Kim Saunders
Posted: 21:44 16 November 2316 GST
--
Hello all,
for those of you who have missed my earlier comm notice, I would like to
organize a meeting to discuss several things important to our pilot core.
1. How can we respond to the recent outbreak of violence against members of the
other alliances?
2. Are we still interested in, and if so, how can we assist with better medical
centre access to the poor in need.
3. What direction would we like our pilot core to go in, how can we change our
image, work together, find our self respect? The future is uncertain, even
though our new president has promised renewed support for our pilot core. There
are so few of us.
4. Any other subjects you may find important to discuss, provided we will have
the time.
I will allow 24 hours for you to suggest times and dates, before I will make the
date for this meeting known. I do feel we should try to organize it somewhere
within the next week though.
For any comments, questions, concerns, ideas, proposals or dates for this
meeting, or anything else that you consider relevant, I invite you to post on
the board, write me a letter or call my office on number 0010-16336.
I am looking forward to working with you all and to a productive meeting. I wish
you a nice day.
Kim Saunders, voice of the core 51st term

does not wish to support a salvage station in 777. So, do not take invaders
parts for it."
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

You say, "I think she was referring to our right to do what we want in regards
to it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well no she is referring to that she
will do anything if it's politically correct for her."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If you had waited
until the conclusion of the vote and then announced you wanted to build the
other station anyway, I may have given you a hand. Now it feels like you are
just trying to circumvent the vote."

is up right now cost one megacredit. The fourth one up I think costs like 4."

impact them. Then here you have Johann and his org who are sitting on over 5000
megacredits."
'Yeah, exactly
You say, "Yeah, exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, by the way. I
built the asteroid processor out at 285, but I was asked not to build the
salvage station until the one in 777 goes down. You are back before it needs
rebuilding, so you may wanna check with Melinda before you do it."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo seems to be hungry.
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo approaches a glossy gold ceramic felo

Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The station is already
built so just needs to be deployed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, but as I said,
I was asked to hold until 777 goes down, and probably depending on the outcome
of the vote."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I don't see why I need to check with
Melinda in the first plac that they all want.e because that is the station."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall

Date November 17, 2316
Dear Mr. Lambeth,
I am providing a statement to you below which concerns my interactions with
Melinda Michaels after she arrived on Famous Andy's Trading Post whereby she
demanded my return to Comms. In addition, i want to share my own perspective and
that I never absolutely refused to return to Comms.
I am very sympathetic to others and especially when the news related such
horrific crimes towards humanity, why, then didn't any of our own pilots support
this? It seems that they only did so when it became apparent that it was a
problem for the AEU and i didn't act immediately on Melinda Michael's request.
Also, i want to point out to you that Kim Saunders who you have just appointed
as Voice of the Corps, yesterday evening, related confidential information which
was posted on our AEU Debate board over the General Channel concerning what I
wrote. Kim Saunders often confides in Melinda Michaels and others from the
League rather than to her own allies. How can we possibly trust someone who is
going to discuss every communication or otherwise which transpires on the AEU
message boards or over the AEU communications channel? Since I'm not able to do
so, I hope your office will, remind AEU pilots of the confidential nature
regarding AEU business and other issues is and how it is to be treated
confidentially and not shared outside of the AEU Pilot Corps. I certainly
thought that this related to what is posted on the message boards within the
AEU, discussions which take place on the aEU communications Channel as well as
during meetings and other exchanges which are specific to the AEU Pilot Corps.
Thank you and please see below.
During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived at Famous
Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long time since we drifted off
course en route and it required about another day to get our bearings and to
correct our course. When melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would
likely want to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back in
Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to prepare a written
statement to send back via Melinda Michaels. However, I didn't get the
opportunity to ask permission to do so. I also really wasn't given time to ask
very many questions. After Melinda Michaels abruptly exited the Galleon, she
went to the Bar and so I also went to the bar. Just as I was about to ask her if
she would consider discussing the situation further with me as well as I also
wanted to prepare something in writing, she bought food and then said her
goodbyes.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda Michaels into the Control Room of the ship and the exchange
proceeded. I asked? "so Melinda do you have a letter from Nissi?" Melinda
Michaels says, "I do not, she is, um, unavailable." Melinda then says, "So we
are running without either voice currently." I nodded to Melinda. I then asked
Melinda? "so who did she appoint to act on her behalf?" "She did not appoint
anybody," Melinda says." "I took it upon myself to come out here and make sure
you guys knew." I then said to Melinda, "well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here." Melinda next said, "Since she is not
available, I will probably take it upon myself to send whatever letters are
needed". "Somebody has to." I then went further to state. "Second, I want to
express that i am very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime
happens to all citizens of all alliances. "I am not happy with what has
occurred." Melinda then nodded in agreement. I then said to Melinda. "Still, I
am not the Military. I am not the AEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to
our Government Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more." I then asked
another question? "So too, did Ather Jammoa send you here?" "Nobody sent me,"
says Melinda. I then said. "ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back in Comms so I'm just trying to understand who wants me
back there." Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice, troubling times are at hand and here I am." Melinda says, "We want some
kind of word, people are getting upset." I responded with. "yes but if our
government felt I should be there, they have the means to dispatch that request
to me. I informed them before I left of my plans as well." Melinda asked the
following which I hoped would be a good faith effort on her part to convey my
need for clarification. "So," asks Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell
people if they ask?" She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had
to say which was. "Even if i were there, I am not the party who can control the
behavior of AEU citizens." Melinda says, "Of course you can't." She continued
with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an official capasity, you will remain
on said trip," Melinda says. "Is this correct?"" I concurred by saying. 'well
it's very much out of my hands. They need to understand that it's not within my
power to control AEU Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal
with those issues. You can certainly convey to them in no uncertain terms that I
am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-emphasis on the
part of the media and related to recent elections no doubt." Melinda says, "Okay
I will do this." Melinda says, "All right." Melinda Michaels then stood up to
leave without repeating anything back to me as well as she didn't let me finish
my response. I continued by stating. "If I were back there, there really isn't
anything I could do." Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies." She
still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went on to say. "AEU
pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to me as well." "That's fine,"
says Melinda." Melinda says, "I tried." "Thank you for doing so." I said.
Melinda waved. Melinda says, "Yup." Melinda says, "Later." I waved back rather
amazed that she seemed both not interested in what I was trying to gather from
the scant information I had as well as nothing official from the leadership from
the league nor Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms. Melinda
Michaels then rather abruptly walked out of the ship. There is certainly more
that I would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a
written statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request
which didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took
time to consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the
AEU seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann
in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went
on to Tom Town to charge overnight and Johann obtained an upgrade for his
Galleon. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of
Fears the next day. I still tried to understand why I hadn't heard anything from
the AEU. There were too many unanswered questions. After a rather sleepless
night, when I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and
very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at
Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better
grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann
was very gracious and he said that he understood my concerns and that we could
return to Comms. There was also no other means aboard Johann's Galleon in the
way of a Quantum Entanglement Device to communicate that we were returning. It
is unfortunate that a hasty decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf as
I had every intention to do my job. I just felt that the League were controlling
things without the AEU's involvement. I further find it regretable that Melinda
was in so much of a hurry not to allow me to prepare a written statement which I
couldn't have prepared before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on.
I apologize to you, as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation
was in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the
plans of others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that
Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't
have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison
office.
As you can see, I never directly said that I wouldn't return. I didn't say a lot
to Johann Rowan because if his being a member of the League, there were certain
aspects which I didn't consider that he should be privy to. From my own personal
perspective. I'm not insensitive to other individuals from other alliances but
it seemed rather odd that the League were so intent on me when their own
leadership isn't performing. I so wish that Ather Jammoa would have at least
sent a statement or a request via the Hyperwave which we tried to monitor during
the times they can be typically used to transmit from the Torus. I was also not
aboard my own ship and didnt feel that i had total control over another pilot's
vessel. Johann Rowan was, however very gracious and did openly indicate that it
was my judgement call to return or not. Therefore, he is not to blame for the
delay.
I want to state that I deplore any and all acts of intimmidation, violance,
destruction of property or otherwise harm that has been inflicted upon any
individual, regardless of which Alliance, clan or where they are from. If those
acts which i have read about in the news are verifiable as a true representation
of fact, I urge the AEU to take immediate actions to seekout, prosecute and
punish those involved. No matter what has been expressed of others, I do not
hate nor wish any harm to be directed towards any human being from any part of
this universe. The AEU must absolutely uphold a zero tolerance to crimes against
humanity or any living being for that matter.

Hi Lily and Shule. I hope you enjoyed your trip.
I just, wanted to write a note for a couple of reasons, the first of them being,
ignore that lot.
You have a friend here, and that doesn't change, just because of all this crap.
The fact is, you came home in the end, and I'm glad you aren't letting the drama
tangle you up. It's not worth it.
Second, you guys, are the best, in saying that you'll keep 777 up.
I love that place more than you can imagine, and I know I also speak for Damien
Alexander, when I say that we would be happy to contribute credits, and our
help, with keeping that thing alive.
I know Nicolette likes it too, and she'd probably help, even if all the orgs are
against it.
Also, if we talk to Ather, he might sell us the other parts we need. So
hopefully, together, even if the orgs don't want in, we can keep what we enjoy
alive.
Please stay safe, and take care.
i am going out on a trip for a while, but we have a qe, so please feel free to
annoy us.

Eve.

One, preferably two, navigators who can read star chart notation and who have
working star charts for the particular area we plan to explore, a captain who is
fair, a skilled and experienced negotiator for interacting with cultures we meet
and who is skilled in problem resolution in case of conflict among the crew,
pilots that have the desire for exploration and a burning curiosity for the new
and unknown, someone to keep an accurate log of the expedition, and an engineer
to oversee repairs and ensure nobody gets left behind after rift drive repairs.

3. A rift-capable ship becomes separated from the ship containing your
navigator. How would you guide the other ship back?
First, I would look to see if any points of interest can be located by the
computer. If so, I would immediately head there and communicate with the other
ship via the hyper caster transmissions. If no points of interests could be
located, I would enable the on-board beacon, and if absolutely necessary, send
out an active ping.

I have not organised very many previous expeditions. However, on a trip out to
the aquarium with only three people on board including myself, we found ourself
lost. After receiving a QE message with more information regarding
non-directional beacons, I proceeded to try to systematically determine which
direction we needed to go. I did this by keeping very careful track of how far
we went before the signal changed and only changing one aspect of the heading.
For example, I tried never to change the heading and elevation at the same time.
So, I might start at a heading of 0, 0 then wait for the signal strength to drop
and then change the heading to 180, 0 and by keeping track of how far we
traveled before the signal dropped again, I was able to determine about where
the middle of that area was. Then I'd do the same thing with the headings 90, 0
and 270, 0. By doing this, I was able to determine in which direction we needed
to head to keep the signal strength increasing and eventually we arrived back in
comms range and found a temporary beacon.

1. What is your interest in this model of vessel? Describe your immediate plans
should you acquire one.
You entered: I intend to replace the sightseer currently attached to my
three-person A.S.S. terroreroticist to form a more comfortable ship with
increased battery charge for short artifacting and exploration trips.
2. It is time to choose an expedition crew. Which roles do you consider
essential and what skills must they have?
You entered: One, preferably two, navigators who can read star chart notation
and who have working star charts for the particular area we plan to explore, a
captain who is fair, a skilled and experienced negotiator for interacting with
cultures we meet and who is skilled in problem resolution in case of conflict
among the crew, pilots that have the desire for exploration and a burning
curiosity for the new and unknown, someone to keep an accurate log of the
expedition, and an engineer to oversee repairs and ensure nobody gets left
behind after rift drive repairs.
3. A rift-capable ship becomes separated from the ship containing your
navigator. How would you guide the other ship back?
You entered: First, I would look to see if any points of interest can be located
by the computer. If so, I would immediately head there and communicate with the
other ship via the hyper caster transmissions. If no points of interests could
be located, I would enable the on-board beacon, and if absolutely necessary,
send out an active ping.
4. You discover a derelict station. What actions do you take?
You entered: I would definitely want to explore it after taking a space image of
it. I would also talk to the crew and obtain the advice of the more experienced
explorers.
5. An unregistered group offers a trade of a fighter in your docking bay for one
of their fighters. What is your response and why?
You entered: I would refuse the offer as I am not authorised to make such a
trade. The government subsidises  a large portion of the costs of ships I have
access to and they would not be pleased with me if I made such a transaction.
6. One of your crew members becomes ill during an expedition. What actions do
you take and why?
You entered: First aid kits have been provided in each ship for situations like
this and therefore I would utilise what I could from it. If this isn't
sufficient and the crew member is still ill, I would contact alliance space via
the QE and ask for advice. If necessary and possible, I would send that person
home in an escape pod.
7. You receive a hypercast from a direction which does not match any known
destinations. It is asking for help. What is your response and why?
You entered: My first worry is that it could be a fellow pilot in need. I would
first see if communication can be established in Esperanto and I would obtain as
much information as possible. I also don't want to risk falling into some sort
of trap that could endanger my crew or ship.
8. What actions would you take upon encountering a non-communicative alien
vessel?
You entered: I would first scan the ship to see if it has power. Perhaps the
alien vessel is unable to communicate due to lack of charge. I would keep my
distance in case the ship were to become aggressive, but I would want to learn
as much as possible. I would also see if the first contact kits could be
utilised in this type of situation. I might also consider following the ship to
see where it goes.
9. Two unregistered parties are conducting a trade of slaves in front of you.
What is your response and why?
You entered: I would either leave or ask the captain if we could leave.
10. You encounter a starship of a hostile faction that is clearly losing life
support and is unable to respond to you with violence. What do you do and why?
You entered: My worry is that if I were to help the ship, they may become
hostile towards my ship once they had received aid. Therefore, I'd probably
leave the area.
11. What previous expeditions have you organised? What is the largest difficulty
you have faced and how did you overcome it?
You entered: I have not organised very many previous expeditions. However, on a
trip out to the aquarium with only three people on board including myself, we
found ourself lost. After receiving a QE message with more information regarding
non-directional beacons, I proceeded to try to systematically determine which
direction we needed to go. I did this by keeping very careful track of how far
we went before the signal changed and only changing one aspect of the heading.
For example, I tried never to change the heading and elevation at the same time.
So, I might start at a heading of 0, 0 then wait for the signal strength to drop
and then change the heading to 180, 0 and by keeping track of how far we
traveled before the signal dropped again, I was able to determine about where
the middle of that area was. Then I'd do the same thing with the headings 90, 0
and 270, 0. By doing this, I was able to determine in which direction we needed
to head to keep the signal strength increasing and eventually we arrived back in
comms range and found a temporary beacon.
12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?
You entered: I plan to name it Freedom and it will replace the sightseer with
the same name.
13. You must choose a theme song that describes you and your approach to
exploration  What song do you choose?
You entered: Taking Chances, Celine Dion
14. What is your favorite color?
You entered: red
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Whatever you applied for, I wish you
