00:03:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:03:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

From a phone-based holoemitter: A floating Space Shopping Network logo appears next to the words "LIMITED TIME OFFER."

00:34:51 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman says, "Usually, we list this item for 269.99 credits."

00:35:03 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman exclaims, "But today, for a limited time only, we're proud to offer this item for just 179.99 credits! That's right, only 179.99 EAOS credits!"

00:35:15 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman smiles. "Just a few moments left to place your order, before this lovely item is gone forever!"

00:35:27 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman's hand traces lightly over the item, highlighting its features.

00:35:39 From a phone-based holoemitter: The camera pans slowly over a white v-neck cotton tee. Constructed of soft white cotton, this t-shirt has a v-neck and short sleeves.

00:35:51 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman exclaims, "Just 179.99 EAOS credits and one of these could be yours!"

00:36:03 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman exclaims, "Call 1111-44248 now to place your order!"

00:36:15 From a phone-based holoemitter: With an air of reluctance, the woman picks up a white v-neck cotton tee.

00:36:51 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman smiles as the shot fades.

00:37:03 From a phone-based holoemitter: The bright orange Space Shopping Network logo fills the view. A phone number is underneath it: 1111-44248.

00:37:15 From a phone-based holoemitter: The image fades to black for a moment.

00:37:27 From a phone-based holoemitter: A voice says excitedly, "Have you ever wanted to own a little piece of space?"

00:37:39 From a phone-based holoemitter: An image appears of an asteroid spinning through space. "Well, now you can!"

00:37:51 From a phone-based holoemitter: "Simply transfer 39.95 credits to the Space Object Registration Database and the next asteroid found by a civilian pilot will be registered in YOUR name!"

00:38:04 From a phone-based holoemitter: An image appears of a smiling family posing in front of an asteroid.

00:38:15 From a phone-based holoemitter: "Imagine the kids being able to tell their school friends that THEIR FAMILY owns a whole asteroid in space! Contact us right now!"

00:38:28 From a phone-based holoemitter: The voice then adds at top speed, "(Disclaimer: Registered asteroid likely to be immediately destroyed at nearest processing station.)" The commercial ends abruptly.

00:38:40 From a phone-based holoemitter: The image fades to black for a moment.

00:38:53 From a phone-based holoemitter: The shot transitions to show a well-dressed woman.

01:21:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

02:13:58 You say to Lily, "Ready?"

02:14:12 You say, "We still have about 15 minutes or so."

You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:14:31  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a stormy pair of trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks.

02:14:33 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

Evenia Callseah, Rogue Romano, and Guindalen Jones are sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:14:51 Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

02:14:53 Evenia Callseah hugs you.

02:14:54 You wave.

02:14:56 You hug Evenia Callseah.

02:14:59 You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.

02:15:00 Evenia Callseah hugs Lily Kaise.

02:15:02 Lily Kaise hugs Evenia Callseah.

02:15:04 Guindalen Jones says, "Hello."

02:15:06 Rogue says to Guindalen, "Hi, you must be the AEU cadet. I'm Rogue."

02:15:09 Lily Kaise says, "Hello."

02:15:09 You smile at Guindalen Jones.

02:15:11 Guindalen Jones takes a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

02:15:17 Rogue Romano says, "Yo Shule."

02:15:21 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

02:15:22 Lily Kaise orders a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

02:15:23 You say to Rogue, "Hi, I'm a new AEU cadet too. Nice to meet you."

02:15:26 Lily Kaise dangles a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:15:26 Rogue Romano waves to Lily Kaise.

02:15:30 Evenia Callseah says, "Zeus is waving too, but he's too lazy to actually do it."

02:15:33 Guindalen Jones says, "Nice to meet you."

02:15:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:15:36 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

02:15:41 Lily Kaise waves to Rogue Romano and smiles.

02:15:42 Rogue says to you, "Oh oh, hello cadet!"

02:15:45 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person light transport "A Dime At A Time" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:15:49 You grin.

02:15:49 Guindalen Jones takes a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

02:15:57 You glance around at your surroundings.

02:16:05 Evenia gently lifts a Tardick lizard named Zeus's right paw and waves it half-heartedly.

02:16:13 You ask, "Whats everyone doing here?"

02:16:21 Guindalen Jones says, "Why hello Zeus."

02:16:26 Rogue Romano says, "Some dude called for missions."

02:16:28 You exclaim, "Hi Zeus!"

02:16:28 Rogue Romano shrugs.

02:16:33 You chuckle at Rogue Romano.

02:16:36 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh, I'm here for that tier 5 nest you've been goin' on about for an hour."

02:16:36 Rogue says to you, "Do you know him?"

02:16:39 Lily whispers to asteria just flick that tail!

02:16:40 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

02:16:43 You say, "Can't say that I do."

02:16:47 Rogue Romano snaps her fingers.

02:16:55 Guindalen Jones takes a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

02:16:57 Rogue Romano says, "I was wonderin' if he's cute."

02:16:58 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

02:17:08 Lily Kaise says, "I don't think I want to rescue a mule this morning so I can go to bed at a reasonable time."

02:17:09 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 700" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:17:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:17:14 You say to Rogue, "I bet he's butt ugly."

02:17:22 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:17:23 Guindalen Jones snickers.

02:17:31 Rogue says to you, "I wouldn't doubt that none."

02:17:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:17:32 Guindalen Jones subsides into silence as her eyes grow large and round, and eventually glaze over. Time passes.

02:17:35 Evenia Callseah says, "I bet he's tiny, and hugely fat and just...bleh."

02:17:39 You're already sitting.

02:17:42 You nod.

02:17:46 You grin.

02:17:49 Jacob Smitt just arrived.

02:17:51 Rogue Romano laughs. "Prob so."

02:17:53 You wave to Jacob Smitt.

02:17:55 Jacob Smitt waves.

02:18:00 Jacob Smitt gives a fuzzy stuffed elk to Rogue Romano.

02:18:02 Rogue Romano waves to Jacob Smitt. "Hi babe."

02:18:05 Rogue Romano says, "Ooh."

02:18:06 Jacob Smitt says, "Hey you."

02:18:10 Rogue Romano cuddles a fuzzy stuffed elk lovingly. Aww.

02:18:13 Lily Kaise waves to Jacob Smitt.

02:18:13 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a chilled margarita garnished with a slice of lime.

02:18:16 Jacob Smitt waves to Lily Kaise.

02:18:23 Jacob Smitt waves to Evenia Callseah.

02:18:24 Rogue Romano says, "So cute."

02:18:24 Lily Kaise orders a hot cup of espresso.

02:18:27 Evenia Callseah waves to Jacob Smitt.

02:18:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:18:41 Rogue Romano puts a fuzzy stuffed elk in a sturdy black canvas Fringe backpack.

02:18:47 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:18:51 Lily Kaise orders a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:18:53 Jacob Smitt says, "Got a Donkey too, but i'm keeping that one."

02:18:58 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "Your girlfriend is over there on lily's shoulder, and you're ignoring her? How rude!"

02:19:00 Lily Kaise gives a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling to Guindalen Jones.

02:19:01 Guindalen Jones finishes off a glass of fizzy cola.

02:19:19 Lily Kaise orders a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:19:20 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

02:19:27 Jacob Smitt sits down on Baranth I'kabara's lap.

02:19:28 Jacob Smitt stands up from Baranth I'kabara's lap.

02:19:33 Jacob Smitt says, "What the fuck."

02:19:34 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:19:34 Guindalen Jones takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:19:43 Guindalen Jones says, "Thanks for the pastry."

02:19:48 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:19:55 Guindalen Jones drops a glass.

02:19:55 As soon as a glass hits the ground, it suddenly shatters into a billion pieces, never to be seen again.

02:19:57 Jacob Smitt says, OOCly, "That is so disconcerting."

02:19:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah one of the few girlie lizies."

02:20:02 Lily Kaise says, "Lizies."

02:20:11 Lily Kaise says, "'something like that."

02:20:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:20:20 You chuckle.

02:20:21 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

02:20:26 Evenia Callseah says, OOCly, "Just gloss that. If a pilot is somewhere for ages, we can't see them anymore."

02:20:31 Jacob Smitt sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

02:20:35 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Yeah thought about that."

02:20:54 Guindalen Jones takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:20:59 Guindalen Jones says, "Mmm."

02:21:03 Lily Kaise is already in your group.

02:21:05 Jacob Smitt asks, OOCly, "So you can just randomely come across a ghost in a room from years ago?"

02:21:05 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a bottle of Chetumalian Springs water.

02:21:06 You hold Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into your group.

02:21:09 You hold Rogue Romano's hand, taking her into your group.

02:21:11 You hold Guindalen Jones's hand, taking her into your group.

02:21:13 You hold Jacob Smitt's hand, taking him into your group.

02:21:16 Jacob Smitt stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

02:21:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:21:22 Evenia Callseah quickly drains a chilled margarita garnished with a slice of lime.

02:21:23 You say, "Just counting people."

02:21:24 Evenia Callseah coughs.

02:21:25 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Oh no, some guy is holdin' my hand!"

02:21:29 Evenia Callseah opens a metallic gold messenger bag.

02:21:31 You chuckle.

02:21:33 Evenia Callseah puts a glass in a shiny chrome trash bin.

02:21:34 Rogue Romano smirks.

02:21:44 Jacob says to Rogue, "So punch him."

02:21:48 Jacob Smitt grins.

02:21:56 Guindalen Jones blinks.

02:21:59 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:22:01 Jacob Smitt says, "You ahve him chained already. Hold the grip tight and start wailing."

02:22:04 Jacob Smitt laughs.

02:22:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:22:07 Evenia Callseah says, "He just loves holding people's hands. It's his thing, you know."

02:22:09 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow?"

02:22:13 Rogue Romano smirks.

02:22:14 Lily Kaise glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

02:22:17 Jacob Smitt asks, "Isn't that what chaining is?"

02:22:22 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

02:22:23 You chuckle.

02:22:23 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the six-person pincer "The Wolves Have Claws" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:22:25 Lily Kaise says, "Well erm."

02:22:25 Evenia Callseah chortles.

02:22:34 Bryan Stout just arrived.

02:22:35 Rogue playfully punches your shoulder.

02:22:36 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 700" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:22:37 You wave to Bryan Stout.

02:22:38 Jacob Smitt says, "I guess I have the name of my Gunship."

02:22:41 Evenia says to Jacob, "Um...You need to go visit a place on chet, that might fix your confusion."

02:22:42 Bryan Stout says, "Oh apparently we're using the cruiser."

02:22:42 Jacob Smitt says, "Chained in love."

02:22:46 You hold Bryan Stout's hand, taking him into your group.

02:22:47 Guindalen Jones asks, "Quick question how long till we start?"

02:22:47 You nod.

02:23:06 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:23:09 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Missions in about 10 minutes. We can take one more person."

02:23:22 You say, "Unless I can't count."

02:23:28 Guindalen smiles nods.

02:23:29 Bryan Stout says, "I see 8 I think."
Rogue Romano says, "I forgot how."

02:23:29 Evenia Callseah glances around at her surroundings.

02:23:32 You say, "Which, I have been known not to be able to do."

02:23:32 Lily Kaise asks, "You counted Bryan?"

02:23:36 You say, "Yep."

02:23:36 Guindalen Jones subsides into silence as her eyes grow large and round, and eventually glaze over. Time passes.

02:23:41 Bryan Stout is already in your group.

02:23:43 Evenia Callseah says, "Nah, we got 7."

02:23:45 Rogue Romano asks, "Bryan counts?"

02:23:47 Bryan Stout says, "7 yeah."

02:23:50 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:23:51 Evenia holds up 9 fingers. "Yeah, 7."

02:23:53 You say, "Ok, good."

02:23:53 Bryan Stout says, "I count sometimes."

02:23:57 You chuckle.

02:24:07 Bryan Stout says, "There was that one time when I took one extra on a cruiser, but that was after a solid year of not running things."

02:24:09 Lily holds up 21 and declares! I win!

02:24:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:24:12 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:24:14 Jacob Smitt says, "Anything past ten, and I need a moment."

02:24:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:24:22 Jacob Smitt says, "Boots take a second to unlace."

02:24:23 You laugh.

02:24:32 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a bottle of Chetumalian Springs water.

02:24:37 Jacob Smitt takes a sip of a cup of hot black Colombian coffee.

02:24:40 Jacob Smitt takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with banana cream filling.

02:24:43 You say, "Yeah, well, I wanted to run beacons in my cruiser and forgot to count myself once."

02:24:47 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:24:51 Jacob Smitt says, "Silly."

02:24:54 Rogue Romano says, "I believe that."

02:24:55 You grin.

02:25:00 Lily says to Evenia, "Oh I loaded that Lounge onto Libs but if you have a top from Morning Star, then I'll use it on something else."

02:25:16 Jacob Smitt says, "I'm almost afraid of joining a Org."

02:25:19 Jacob Smitt chuckles.

02:25:19 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Missions in 5 minutes. One more person?"

02:25:21 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

02:25:32 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 700" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:25:38 Evenia Callseah grins at Lily Kaise. "I sorta um...Screwed up and didn't think about star. I broke it. I was rushing to put parts together and..."

02:25:48 You ask, "Ok, anyone wish to fly?"

02:25:51 Bryan Stout says, "Let's underscrew."

02:25:52 Lily Kaise asks, "'uh so we're not on there?"

02:25:53 Bryan Stout nods and nods.

02:25:57 Rogue Romano stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

02:26:00 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "If I did mission, you'd ahve to wait on me to come back."

02:26:01 Jacob Smitt says, "Either Bryan or myself, or even you."

02:26:05 Rogue Romano stretches.

02:26:14 Evenia says to Lily, "No no. You guys are. I mean that I used your lounge. And forgot morningstar."

02:26:20 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm across the rift in the 285 asteroid station."

02:26:21 Bryan says to Jacob, "Don't volunteer me. I came to shoot things."

02:26:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:26:21 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

02:26:27 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

02:26:28 Guindalen Jones takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:26:32 Lily Kaise says, "Oh aww I'm sorry about that I shouldn't have confused things."

02:26:36 Jacob says to Bryan, "I'd say you suck, but you might."

02:26:47 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We could wait if you headed back momentarily."

02:26:51 Evenia Callseah says, "It's all good. It was my bad for not paying attention. Ali will forgive me."

02:27:02 You say to Jacob, "You want to fly?"

02:27:03 Lily Kaise says, "I'm thinking in future, may build the transmitter separately so it will last awhile and we can put a lounge on the recharging station."

02:27:05 Bryan says to Jacob, "I do suck there is no might."

02:27:10 Jacob Smitt says, "I can."

02:27:11 You chuckle at Bryan Stout.

02:27:17 Rogue Romano finishes off a bottle of Chetumalian Springs water.

02:27:21 Bryan Stout grins.

02:27:21 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

02:27:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:27:25 Evenia Callseah nods to Lily Kaise. "That's a good idea actually."

02:27:25 Rogue Romano puts a bottle in a shiny chrome trash bin.

02:27:31 Lily Kaise nods.

02:27:38 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Should we wait for you?"

02:27:41 Bryan says to Jacob, "Don't get hit too much. AEU cruisers are delicate."

02:27:42 Bryan Stout smirks.

02:27:49 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, I'm coming back."

02:27:50 Evenia says to Lily, "You did see that the beacon is dropping in a few hours?"

02:27:51 Lily Kaise says, "I don't think any of us can get the galley but that would be nice too."

02:27:55 Jacob Smitt gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:27:56 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire cheers.

02:28:02 Jacob Smitt says, "I will do my best."

02:28:07 You smirk at Bryan Stout.

02:28:14 You say to Bryan, "Quiet you."

02:28:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:28:19 Guindalen Jones finishes off a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:28:25 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:28:30 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:28:31 You say to Bryan, "Or I'll make you gun from outside the ship."

02:28:44 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:28:44 Bryan Stout says, "Hey Nissi's ship has that."

02:28:45 Evenia Callseah says, "We'll dangle him off the side with a stun weapon."

02:28:48 Bryan Stout says, "External turrets."

02:28:49 You grin.

02:28:51 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

02:28:51 Rogue Romano asks, "Hey Bry, say... aaahh?"

02:29:00 Jacob Smitt says, "Does it have windows? We could roll those down and have him use harsh language."

02:29:01 Lily Kaise finishes off a hot cup of espresso.

02:29:03 You say, "That would be cool thought. The external turrets thing."

02:29:07 You say, "Er though."

02:29:07 Bryan Stout nods and nods.

02:29:10 Lily Kaise puts a cup in a shiny chrome trash bin.

02:29:13 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lost In Paradise". The organization has earned 668,771.80 credits.

02:29:22 Guindalen Jones orders a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango juice.

02:29:27 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:29:28 Guindalen Jones takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango juice.

02:29:29 Evenia Callseah says, "I could probably curse any outsider so bad he'd leave. I don't think we should test that though. I don't wanna die today."

02:29:34 Bryan Stout says, "Yeah no."

02:29:37 Lily Kaise nods.

02:29:39 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:29:42 You nod.

02:29:44 Lily Kaise finishes off a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:29:48 You say, "We don't want anyone dying today."

02:30:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:30:11 Lily says to you, "So who are we waiting for?"

02:30:16 You say to Lily, "Eva."

02:30:16 Evenia Callseah asks, "I would really like to hold off on the dying thing for at least a couple more days. Can we do that?"

02:30:27 Rogue Romano says, "Evenia's twin I thought."

02:30:32 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

02:30:33 "Ok that's cool!" Lily Kaise smiles.

02:30:35 Jacob says to Rogue, "God I'm 28. Wha should I do? Get a drink from someplace? Get drunk and see if I can end up someplace new?"

02:30:40 Jacob Smitt gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:30:47 You say to Jacob, "Do the chicken dance."

02:30:53 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Five minutes and nine seconds, then I'm yours."

02:30:58 Jacob Smitt says, "I can't."

02:30:59 Bryan Stout keys his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:30:59 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout whistles.

02:31:06 Jacob Smitt says, "My legs are to thick."

02:31:06 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Awesome."

02:31:09 Bryan Stout speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:31:10 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I am here with my gunning leash."

02:31:12 Evenia Callseah says, "I do not want my birthday to come. I am hiding from it."

02:31:14 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 700" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:31:15 Bryan Stout speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:31:15 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "That made no sense. Ignore me."

02:31:16 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 855" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:31:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:31:28 Jacob Smitt says, "I haven't celebrated my brithday since I was 10."

02:31:29 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oooh."

02:31:33 Jacob Smitt says, "Birthday, I mean."

02:31:37 You ask, "I have a brithday?"

02:31:40 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:31:42 You ask, "Birthday?"

02:31:42 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll be 30. I don't wanna. I'm hiding."

02:31:51 Jacob Smitt grins.

02:31:57 Jacob Smitt says, "But you'd make 30 look hot."

02:32:05 You ask, "How come nobody ever told me I had such a thing?"

02:32:08 Rogue Romano smiles at Jacob Smitt. "Well, I suppose we can fig somethin' out to do."

02:32:09 Evenia Callseah pokes you in the ribs!

02:32:15 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it's scarey as I was 24 when I became a pilot. Not as young as many but I had already been working."

02:32:16 You say to Evenia, "What?"

02:32:21 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

02:32:32 Evenia says to you, "You're a smart ass. Stop it."

02:32:34 You say to Evenia, "I am innocent. Remember?"

02:32:35 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:32:42 Lily Kaise tickles you!

02:32:46 You grin.

02:32:49 Evenia Callseah chortles. "Sure, you're about as innocent as half of me."

02:32:54 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:32:56 Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:32:57 Guindalen Jones chuckles.

02:32:58 You laugh.

02:33:07 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Tell me about it!"

02:33:09 Jacob says to Evenia, "Smartass? Your so ass fixated. The rest of him got though school tool."

02:33:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:33:11 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "Ain't that right."

02:33:28 Jacob Smitt says, "I think."

02:33:32 You chuckle.

02:33:38 You're already sitting.

02:33:47 Evenia Callseah looks at Jacob Smitt thoughtfully.

02:33:54 Evenia says to Jacob, "You are a confusing man, sir."

02:34:10 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 700" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:34:12 Jacob Smitt says, "What is confusing."

02:34:15 Guindalen Jones gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:34:17 Jacob Smitt says, "You called him a smartass."

02:34:29 Jacob Smitt says, "And I said the rest of him got through school too."

02:34:33 Guindalen Jones takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango juice.

02:34:35 Bryan Stout says, "Some of me didn't."

02:34:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:34:40 Evenia says to Lily, "Do you wanna do what we did yesterday. Since...Well. we've both probably got that gunning issue today?"

02:34:43 Lily Kaise tunes a metachannel FTL communicator.

02:34:49 You say to Guindalen, "Don't worry. We're not all as weird as most of them."

02:35:06 Jacob Smitt shrugs.

02:35:09 Rogue Romano asks, "Am I a weird one?"

02:35:14 Rogue Romano glances around at her surroundings.

02:35:17 You nod to Rogue Romano. "For sure."

02:35:19 Jacob says to Rogue, "Seems like I am."

02:35:26 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm more weird than most. Get used to it."

02:35:32 Lily Kaise smirks.

02:35:32 Rogue says to you, "Oh, why thank you!"

02:35:32 You laugh at Evenia Callseah.

02:35:41 You grin.

02:36:15 Evenia Callseah asks, "I mean I talk to Vartija here like he's a best friend. Who does that shit?"

02:36:16 Vartija the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Unknown command. Please ask for 'help.'"

02:36:20 Evenia Callseah sighs at Vartija the arachnoid security robot.

02:36:22 You chuckle.

02:36:29 Evenia says to Vartija the arachnoid security robot, "I wasn't talking to you then. Hush."

02:36:34 Jacob Smitt says, "And seems to enjoy the conversations greatly."

02:36:47 Evenia Callseah says, "He does."

02:36:49 You say to Vartija the arachnoid security robot, "Yes, you do need tohelp her."

02:36:55 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Hi vartija!"

02:36:56 Vartija the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Hello, Evenia."

02:37:02 Evenia Callseah says, "See? He does."

02:37:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I assume new earth?"

02:37:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Correct."

02:37:13 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:37:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes Ma'm."

02:37:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright, coming there."

02:37:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Fantastic."

02:37:42 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lost In Paradise" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:37:48 Lily Kaise cheers.

02:37:48 Evenia Callseah stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

02:37:50 Evangeline Adaire just arrived.

02:37:54 You hold Evangeline Adaire's hand, taking her into your group.

02:37:55 You stand up from a slim and fashionable couch.

02:38:00 Jacob Smitt runs his fingers back and forth through Rogue Romano's hair.

02:38:01 Bryan Stout says, "Wait."

02:38:05 You nod.

02:38:08 Bryan Stout orders a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

02:38:12 Lily Kaise looks at Bryan Stout thoughtfully.

02:38:12 Evangeline Adaire speaks into her violet touch einrophone:
Evangeline Adaire asks, "Marcus?"

02:38:13 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:38:13 You grin.

02:38:15 Bryan Stout orders a flaky iced pastry with banana cream filling.

02:38:20 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

02:38:21 Bryan Stout exclaims, "Okay!"

02:38:21 Rogue Romano smiles at Jacob Smitt.

02:38:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:38:24 Evangeline is speaking into a violet touch einrophone as she is grabbed.

02:38:24 Lily Kaise orders a hot cup of espresso.

02:38:25 Bryan Stout takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

02:38:31 Jacob says to you, "I'll be ready by the time we get out there."

02:38:33 You grin.

02:38:41 Evangeline Adaire speaks into her violet touch einrophone:

02:38:41 Evangeline Adaire says, "Ah I think I know who you mean."

02:38:48 You say to Lily, "Please take everyone into the control lobby when we board."

02:38:52 Lily Kaise nods.

02:38:52 Bryan Stout takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

02:38:55 Bryan Stout gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:38:57 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

02:38:57 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, Vartija the arachnoid security robot, and Muffin the little orange CatBot here.
Guindalen Jones is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch. Evenia Callseah, Rogue Romano, Lily Kaise, Jacob Smitt, Bryan Stout, and Evangeline Adaire are standing here.
You can go out.

02:39:02 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 700" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:39:05 You pull Guindalen Jones to her feet.

02:39:09 Evangeline Adaire speaks into her violet touch einrophone:

02:39:09 Evangeline Adaire says, "I know who you meant."

02:39:17 Lily Kaise says to you, "Taking Raging Seas?"

02:39:21 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into stairway to the pilot's lounge.

02:39:22 You say, "Sure."

02:39:27 Lily Kaise beams.

02:39:31 You say to Lily, "But I'm not flying though."

02:39:35 You peer into stairway to the pilot's lounge...

02:39:42 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.
Muffin the little orange CatBot trots happily in after Rogue Romano with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.
Lily Kaise, Evenia Callseah, Rogue Romano, Guindalen Jones, Jacob Smitt, Bryan Stout, and Evangeline Adaire followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:39:46 Evangeline Adaire continues speaking into a violet touch einrophone quietly, following along.

02:39:50 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]

02:39:50 You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

02:39:51 Lily Kaise leaves your group.

02:39:53 Bryan Stout looks at Evangeline Adaire thoughtfully.

02:39:54 You disband your group.

02:39:57 Evangeline Adaire speaks into her violet touch einrophone:

02:39:58 Evangeline Adaire says, "And I can understand how that would effect you."

02:40:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:40:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:40:02 Bryan Stout ambles south.

02:40:04 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:40:05 Evangeline Adaire glides south.

02:40:07 Evenia Callseah tramps south.

02:40:07 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters after Evenia Callseah.
Rogue Romano slinks south.
Muffin the little orange CatBot trots happily after Rogue Romano with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:40:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:40:13 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]

02:40:13 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Guindalen Jones and Jacob Smitt are standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:40:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Raging Seas, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:40:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:40:21 You say, "Go south."

02:40:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:40:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:40:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:40:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:40:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:40:38 Lily Kaise glides in from the south followed by Evangeline Adaire and Bryan Stout.

02:40:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:40:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:40:40 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:40:41 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

02:40:41 Evangeline Adaire says to Bryan Stout, "Nadine."

02:40:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:40:44 Lily Kaise holds Guindalen Jones's hand, taking her into her group.

02:40:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:40:44 Bryan Stout says, "No not yet."

02:40:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:40:45 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:40:46 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:40:47 Lily Kaise holds Jacob Smitt's hand, taking him into her group.

02:40:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:40:48 Bryan Stout says, "Oh that."

02:40:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:40:49 Evangeline Adaire says to Bryan, "I will concentrate on Gunning, I swear."

02:40:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:40:50 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:40:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

02:40:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:40:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:40:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:40:55 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:40:58 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Raging Seas. Welcome to Accord space."

02:40:58 You accidentally slam your shoulder into Guindalen Jones as you attempt to work with a nearby control panel.

02:41:05 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]

02:41:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.

02:41:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:41:56 You take control of Lily Kaise's group.

02:41:56 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:42:03 Guindalen Jones asks, "What room?"

02:42:05 Evenia Callseah gestures vaguely at herself.

02:42:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:42:14 Lily Kaise says, "Stay put for the moment."

02:42:14 You say to Guindalen, "Hang on."

02:42:15 Evangeline Adaire speaks into her violet touch einrophone:

02:42:15 Evangeline Adaire says, "Alright, see you."

02:48:33 
[Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Three.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Two.

[Starship "The Wolves Have Claws"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "It's A Wolf Thing"; Weapons Room Four]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

05:26:00 Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200. At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500 Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations. I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

Apartments are places that your character can rent and furnish to their liking. You will find several apartment buildings scattered across planets and space stations.

Apartments require an initial deposit, as well as rent paid once a month. This rent is due on the first day of every month. If your rent is more than two months overdue, you will lose access to your apartment and eventually be evicted.

RENTING AN APARTMENT

You can register for your apartment from any apartment lobby with the REGISTER command. This will offer you a selection of floors where you can place your apartment. Generally, each floor has a different apartment layout, so pay attention to how many bathrooms and other rooms you'll be getting, as well as extra features. Bigger apartments have higher rent, of course. You can only own one apartment in each apartment complex.

You also pay your rent in the lobby by simply using the RENT command.

If you wish to permanently move out of your apartment, use the MOVE command. Since you can only rent one apartment per building, you must do this if you wish to upgrade to a better apartment.

VISITING AN APARTMENT

If you're inside an apartment, you can type OPEN DOOR to allow others to enter freely. You'll want to close the door again afterwards, of course.

If you are visiting an apartment, you may use the BUZZ command in the lobby to let the residents know that you've arrived.

MANAGING OTHER RESIDENTS

You have two commands controlling who can freely enter your apartment: ALLOW and DISALLOW. They do about what you'd expect. You must use them while inside your apartment.

As the original renter of the apartment, you will always be responsible for its rent, no matter who else might be living there.

REPURPOSING ROOMS

You might have noticed that your new apartment is filled with a lot of empty rooms! You can fix this with the REPURPOSE command. This will change the room's name and default description, letting you lay out your apartment however you like.

Certain rooms cannot be moved, such as bathrooms. You are not a space plumber.

Furnishing is entirely up to you!

LUXURY FEATURES

Once your character is wealthy enough, you may end up renting a place at a luxury apartment complex or building. These places tend to have a few extra features:

* Restricted access: Most of the building is inaccessible to people who are not residents.
* Special rooms: Residents may enjoy a private pool, gym, lounge, or other features.
* Mail room: Residents may reroute their mail to a mail room inside the building.
* Self-storage: A self-storage room may be available to safely store your large items. Only residents of your apartment can access your self-storage unit.
* Concierge phone service: Check the lobby for a number for the front desk. The conc
05:39:34 ierge will let you pay your rent over the phone, or call a taxi to and from your building.

14:38:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes, and a small purple trash bin here.

15:16:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:16:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:16:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:16:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:16:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:32:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:32:17 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:32:22 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

16:32:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:32:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:32:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:32:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The advanced scout "Celtic Rose", the two-person light transport "Pelican", the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 372", the three-person clipper "Firestorm", and the two-person Accord gemini "The Wolves Have Eyes" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

16:46:12 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "The Wolves Have Eyes" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

You can go south, up, and out.

20:08:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:08:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:08:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:08:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:08:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:08:55 The ship is already moving.

20:08:56 The ship is already moving.

20:08:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:08:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:08:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:09:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

20:09:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:09:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:09:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I transferred a load at the temporary station and did get much more money."

20:09:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:09:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:09:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:09:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:09:12 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:09:15 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

20:09:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it said I wouldn't get the money until the station's salvage was transferred somewhere else."

20:09:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Awesome!"

20:09:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that also true of the points? It seems like I got no points."

20:09:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:09:38 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:09:40 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Hexidus" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

20:09:40 I don't understand that.

20:09:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:09:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:09:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:14:29 You peer northeast...

20:14:30 
[Starship "Liber Wing Alpha"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a black leather captain's chair here.
Nathaniel Owens is standing here.
You can go southeast, south, southwest, and out.

20:33:26 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Liber Wing Alpha"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a black leather captain's chair here.

20:59:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:59:20 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:59:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:59:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:59:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:59:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:59:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:59:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:59:47  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.

21:07:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:07:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", a wormhole drive tracer, and Shule Elemmire's workbench here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:07:43 Wait 2 seconds.

21:07:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:07:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:07:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:07:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:07:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:21:41 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Earth Lounge."

21:21:43 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Can't do missions until midnight."

21:21:46 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I'll join! ETA is... three hours."

21:22:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow, that's some bad flow."

21:22:40 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Yep. And I don't even have a portable hot tub to wait in."

21:22:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:23:08 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Need more people."

21:23:15 You can't go that way.

21:23:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:23:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:23:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:23:24 [Tactical Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "For what?"

21:23:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:23:33 The ship is already moving.

21:23:33 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Beacons. Missions. Whatever."

21:23:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:23:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:23:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:23:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

21:23:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:23:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:23:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:23:43 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:23:44 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

21:23:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:23:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:23:47 [Tactical Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "Oh I will do a beacon."

21:23:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:23:48 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:23:49 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:23:50 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

21:23:51 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

21:23:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:23:54 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-90" has jumped into the sector.

21:23:55 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-34" has jumped into the sector.

21:23:57 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 123" has jumped out of the sector.

21:23:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:23:59 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-90" has jumped out of the sector.

21:24:01 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-34" has jumped out of the sector.

21:24:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:24:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:24:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:24:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:24:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:24:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:24:14 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:24:15 You exit the ship.

21:24:15 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 599" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

21:24:17 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

21:24:17 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Jason Rat is dozing on a cushy booth seat. Katina Faye is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair. Ali Candan is sitting on a cushy booth seat. Jacob Smitt is standing here.
You can go out.

21:24:19 Ali Candan takes Katina Faye into his group.

21:24:23 Ali Candan takes Jacob Smitt into his group.

21:24:23 Ali Candan takes you into his group.

21:24:24 Katina Faye exclaims, "Shule!"

21:24:27 Katina Faye waves to you.

21:24:29 I don't understand that.

21:24:30 Jacob Smitt orders a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

21:24:32 You wave to Katina Faye.

21:24:38 You say, "I can't do missions though."

21:24:42 Ali Candan says, "It's fine."

21:24:44 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:24:45 A group of pilots is holding an intense meeting on the other side of the room.

21:24:50 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 599" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

21:24:53 Ali Candan says, "We can do beacons instead."

21:24:57 I don't see that here.

21:25:01 Katina Faye nods.

21:25:01 You smile at Katina Faye.

21:25:05 Jacob Smitt says, "I have 7 open."

21:26:40 Katina Faye laughs.

21:26:50 Katina Faye says, "The more the better."

21:26:52 Jacob Smitt asks, "Have you tried the muffins?"

21:26:52 Katina Faye smiles.

21:26:54 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

21:26:54 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "We're waiting in the Earth Lounge."

21:26:56 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:26:59 Katina Faye says, "No."

21:27:03 [Tactical Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "Oh sorry going."

21:27:09 Jacob Smitt says, "Let's see."

21:27:15 Jacob Smitt strolls out.

21:27:19 Katina Faye takes a sip of a mug of hot rich French coffee.

21:27:32 You say to Ali, "Can I engineer?"

21:27:37 Jacob Smitt just arrived.

21:27:44 Ali says to you, "You're not qualified to do that get out."

21:27:47 Ali Candan grins at you.

21:27:48 You chuckle.

21:28:02 Ali says to you, "Sure bro. Go ahead."

21:28:07 Jacob Smitt says to Katina, "Free a hand."

21:28:10 Ali Candan takes Jacob Smitt into his group.

21:28:11 Katina Faye quickly drains a mug of hot rich French coffee.

21:28:12 You say, "Then I'll stand in engineering and try to look like I'm being productive."

21:28:16 You grin at Ali Candan.

21:28:24 Jacob Smitt says, "Well, that had to be lovely on the throat."

21:28:24 Katina Faye puts a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee in a small red trash can.

21:28:28 Katina Faye says, "Oh."

21:28:30 Jacob Smitt chuckles.

21:28:33 Ali Candan says, "As long as you don't look like you're trying to be reproductive."

21:28:33 Katina Faye blushes.

21:28:34 I don't see that here.

21:28:37 You chuckle at Katina Faye.

21:28:42 Jacob Smitt says, "Its all good."

21:28:45 Jacob Smitt gives a warm chocolate chip muffin to Katina Faye.

21:28:46 Katina Faye puts a mug in a small red trash can.

21:28:47 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person runabout "You Can't Just Fly With Wings".

21:28:51 You say to Katina, "Easy there. No need to burn yourself with the coffee."

21:28:52 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Rosebud".

21:30:14 Katina says to Ali, "We're doing Beacons?"

21:30:15 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah maybe like 3."

21:30:16 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ish."

21:30:21 Ali says to Katina, "Yep."

21:30:22 Nathaniel Owens nods.

21:30:24 Katina Faye grins.

21:30:26 Katina Faye says, "Okie dokie."

21:30:34 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

21:30:34 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "1 more for a cruiser."

21:30:35 Nathaniel Owens says, "I need a lot of beacons."

21:30:50 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

21:30:53 You say, "We're going to do them in 8 separate cargo haulers. Hope you all are prepared."

21:30:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

21:30:57 Ali Candan says, "I'll go check on the ship."

21:30:59 Ali Candan disbands his group.

21:30:59 Katina Faye laughs.

21:31:00 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

21:31:00 Ali Candan just went into the stairway to the garage.

21:31:02 Jacob Smitt says, "We can DO it."

21:31:06 Nathaniel Owens says, "Yeah. I am. Lets rock this."

21:31:12 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

21:31:14 Katina sighs happily.

21:31:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm getting so close to the vectoring thingie."

21:31:17 You say, "No upgrades."

21:31:19 Jacob Smitt grins at Katina Faye.

21:31:22 Nathaniel Owens says, "All unupgraded cargo haullers, I would hope."

21:31:23 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

21:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Nice!"

21:31:32 Alexandra Rose says, "I hope not."

21:31:34 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Over drivven too?"

21:31:35 Jacob Smitt says into his off-white metachannel FTL communicator, "Hey there."

21:31:43 Jacob Smitt says into his off-white metachannel FTL communicator, "About to go on beacons."

21:31:45 You nod to Nathaniel Owens.

21:31:48 You chuckle.

21:31:52 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "It's the creature that calls himself the org founder."

21:31:58 Jacob Smitt says into his off-white metachannel FTL communicator, "You no want in?"

21:32:01 Nathaniel says to you, "Good."

21:32:12 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 599" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

21:32:12 Katina Faye finishes off a warm chocolate chip muffin.

21:32:31 Nathaniel Owens says, "Now you've got me worried."

21:32:38 You laugh.

21:32:44 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the eight-person prime defense mark two "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

21:32:49 Nathaniel Owens says, "How about we do 8 gunships, one person to each gunship."

21:32:57 You say, "Nah."

21:33:00 Katina Faye giggles.

21:33:03 Jacob says to Katina, "There is a shop just outside and along that southern corridor that has a nice little coffee shop. They have those muffins and Donuts."

21:33:03 You say, "Cargo haulers it is."

21:33:06 Nathaniel Owens says, "Be a good workout."

21:33:10 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the eight-person prime defense mark two "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight".

21:33:12 Katina Faye nods to Jacob Smitt.

21:33:12 Ali Candan just arrived.

21:33:13 You say, "It's the only way to go."

21:33:17 Ali Candan takes Katina Faye into his group.

21:33:18 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person light transport "Pelican".

21:34:05 I can't find "chair."

21:34:06 [Starship "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight"; Engineering Room]

21:34:07 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

21:34:13 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

21:34:18 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Last call for cruiser beacons. Need 1 person."

21:34:52 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Looks like under crewed it is."

21:35:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:35:13 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

21:35:20 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Settled."

21:35:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:35:27 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo we have Johann."

21:35:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:35:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:35:44 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:36:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:36:12 You peer north...

You see an ammunition storage box here.
You can go south.

21:36:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:36:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:36:28 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:36:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:36:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:02:51 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Then again they could just set the bar low because we choose to become pilots."

22:02:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:02:53 The ship's lights dim briefly as additional energy is shunted into the starship's weapon rooms.

22:02:53 An expert battle recharge appears to have six uses left.

22:02:53 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

22:02:56 The ship vibrates slightly as a hail of bullets is fired from its chainguns.

22:02:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:02:57 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

22:02:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:02:59 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Down."

22:03:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is that."

22:03:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:03:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm at least as sane as Shule."

22:03:59 You prepare to use an expert battle restoration.

22:03:59 (3 seconds roundtime.)

22:04:02 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

22:04:03 You hear a sudden high-pitched whine all over the ship as the engineer effects swift repair of all components.
An expert battle restoration appears to have twelve uses left.

22:04:04 The damage control computer reports, "Repair of light turret #19 has been completed."

22:04:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Maybe."

22:04:09 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Armor is gone."

22:04:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:04:11 [Starship "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight"; Engineering Room]

22:04:11 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

22:04:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How much is that really sayin?"

22:04:23 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "More?"

22:04:28 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm game."

22:04:29 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

22:04:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I'm out. Sorry."

22:04:33 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I cannot."

22:04:40 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "As many as you'd like."

22:04:41 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:04:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:04:48 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "IFS."

22:05:01 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Smart."

22:05:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Shule, how sane are you?"

22:05:17 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm totally normal."

22:05:27 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:05:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:05:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:05:35 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:05:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:05:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:05:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:05:40 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:06:18 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So we done then, or you want to try for gunship?"

22:06:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:06:27 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're not done yet."

22:06:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:06:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:06:37 You are credited with 6,266,630.06 League credits of bounty.
313,331.50 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

22:06:49 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Morris I'm locked out."

22:06:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Get in here."

22:06:58 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Go morris, go."

22:07:04 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Just...turn off your coms."

22:07:39 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "See? So if Shule is completely normal and I am at least as sane as him...We're good."

22:07:46 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Oh dear."

22:07:49 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

22:07:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He says he's completely normal."

22:10:20 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Melinda said something like a week ago that was absolutely savage."

22:10:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My question is. What are you using to rate the savage? I mean. What gets points. And what makes you lose points?"

22:10:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Just think of it as a burn scale."

22:11:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh, well that makes it much easier."

22:11:13 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The worse the person gets roasted, the more savage."

22:11:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My goal is for a 10. I will find a way."

22:11:40 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Melinda managed an eight."

22:12:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am a gentle caring soul, so this could take time. But work with me here."

22:12:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:12:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:12:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:12:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. I musta missed it."

22:12:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

22:12:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:12:45 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 599" has jumped out of the sector.

22:12:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:12:48 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:12:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:13:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Huh."

22:13:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I missed it too. But if it was related to that...Uh. situation. I can imagine it being pretty damn savage."

22:13:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:13:36 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:13:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:13:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:13:49 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Not Gonz. Gonzo."

22:13:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:13:56 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:13:59 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "You butcher the nickname."

22:14:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:14:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:14:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have called him Gonz since he joined the corps. I'm not about to stop now."

22:14:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He's a little less O if he's Gonz and not Gonzo."

22:14:22 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I get it, like he is a gonzo from the fleet, right?"

22:14:32 [General Communication] "Wow?" Morris Corlew laughs.

22:14:41 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:40:10 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:40:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:15:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I mean, it's the hawk!"

23:15:16 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Perhaps the tips."

23:15:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just the tip."

23:15:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah snickers.

23:17:55 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Morris if I did manage, I am sure I could get paid for it."

23:18:03 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Only reason he was speachless is beacuse he was taking a trip down imagination street."

23:18:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "By whom?"

23:18:15 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Someone, I am sure."

23:18:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

23:18:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Shit. Making Morris speechless is so rare that yeah, I'd probably pay you."

23:18:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "See."

23:19:02 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "If you manage for 3 days in a row i'll pay you 100 mil."

23:19:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll raise that by another hundred."

23:19:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I might be speechless just 'cause just so you can give up your credits Nathaniel."

23:19:51 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "You do that and the credits will be coming out of your account."

23:20:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You have no access to my account, so good luck with that."

23:24:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I wonder if I could go a whole 24 hours without saying a single swear word? Shit, I'd pay me if I managed that."

23:25:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Morris couldn't manage to stay speechless unless he was either sleeping or was talking somewhere else with his comms off for three hours, let alone three days."

23:25:06 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ha, ha."

23:25:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

23:25:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A true comment."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Athe rmakes nothing less."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "True comments are normally the most savage."

23:30:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hey Ather, do you still have that airlock cycle plant?"

23:32:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Attention AEU pilots. In an attempt to help limit the spread of Bari, keep your ships powered down and garaged! Even though there is no active Bari threat at the moment, they could technically strike at any time, and you don't want to be the reason that an infestation spreads to other landed ships."

23:32:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:32:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

23:35:30 The walls of this subfloor appear to be carved out of the natural rock. Small crystals are set at regular intervals along the floor and ceiling, glowing with artificial light. The staircase leading both up and down appears hewn from the very rock as well. Signs beside the staircase inform you that the gym and communal area on this floor are open to all residents of the complex. Straight ahead are the building's mail room and self-storage room.

23:59:35 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:59:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

23:59:39 Not much to see out there.

23:59:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:59:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:59:49 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:59:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:59:51 You peer out...

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The advanced scout "Celtic Rose", the one-person cargo hauler "Golden Dawn", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
