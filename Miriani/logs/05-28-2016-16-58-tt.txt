Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

say what you want. But maybe it will interest you to know that the founder of
Cats, Nissi, told me that allowing members from other alliances to join was the
only way to give the org any kind of future, as in new members who want to do
things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm certain that Nissi
said that but you are taking her way out of context. You didn't figure in what
she would likely add are the consequences of political relationships with other
alliances and how they affect an organizaiton's Unity and disorganization as
well as if you want to continue to participate in station building to help other
pilots which most organizations like to do, then you will be more limited as to
which level of modules you will be able to purchase through the organization.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and

1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own.
What do you do and why?
You entered: Move in, string them out if necessary, and take out as many ships
as I can. On beacons and missions, we are out numbered and out gunned.
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
You entered: Same thing as above and call for reiforcements if necessary.
3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
You entered: Short one gunner as I can still do damage with being short a
gunner. Being short an engineer means no one is available to use advanced
engineering tools quickly if necessary.
4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
You entered: Do what's necessary to leave the sector, call for backup, get
repairs, and once backup arrives, head back in.
5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
You entered: Since the battle seems to have already been won, we leave the
sector.
6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what
would be your priority and why?
You entered: My first priority would be to protect New Earth and other major
alliance planets and space stations. I would want to defend other civilians and
any research that is going on.
7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing
commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?
You entered: I would try to be respectful and calm and encourage my crew to do
the same.
8. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?
You entered: IFS ships as I have no experience flying against them.
9. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?
You entered: Not very long. I'll take it out the same day I purchase it and
upgrade it.
10. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?
You entered: During an invasion.
11. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?
You entered: Lethal Strike
12. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while
fighting. What song do you choose?
You entered: Thunderstruck
13. What is your favorite color?
You entered: `Red

Subject: starseekers is looking for new members
Author: Kim Saunders
Posted: 17:19 28 May 2316 GST

Hi,
Myself and various other Starseekers members have been talking for some time
about various things we want to change about the org. I am excited to post here
that we have decided to welcome pilots from any alliance that might wish to
join.
I would like to add at this point that we are not looking for people who just
enjoy doing their own things and working solo. neither do we have the desire to
constantly be working ourselves into the ground. If you are looking for an org
to join where you can meet friends, have a good time, take part in social
activities, exploration trips and other things we might organize as an
organization, then Starseekers might be the place for you. If you are that kind
of person looking for what we hope to turn into a fun org, then I invite you to
apply for membership. if you have more questions first? No problem. Talk to me,
Shule or Angel on comms, write a letter, or give one of us a ring if you have
our einrophone numbers.
Kim Saunders, starseekers Founder

much," Lily says.

you all won't be able to purchase certain temporary modules at a higher level."

Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.
'Well, how does Ather's org do it then?
"Well," you ask, "how does Ather's org do it then?"
Lily says, "What Kim said to me was that Nissi had told her it was good for an
org to diversify but I'm sure nissi added that as long as the political
relationships between the alliances involved were optimum and not as a NAP."
'I wasn't privy to that conversation. So I don't know what she told Kim, but
Ather has an org with AEu and Mutuality... so how does that work?
"I wasn't privy to that conversation," you say. "So I don't know what she told
Kim, but Ather has an org with AEu and Mutuality... so how does that work?"
"Until we have better relations with all of the alliances, our organizations
will suffer," Lily says.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly
while dancing around it.
"She has this hang-up about points and I think she thinks that's all it's about
for me," Lily says. "That is not what I was trying to tell her but here she's
all about being helpful and social and things but if you can't provide very good
components for stations, then Starseekers isn't as viable."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Is that salvage operation still
ongoing?"
"Anyway that's my take and I wish you all luck," Lily says.
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "Its almost done."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee

Lily says, "Ather has had an org for years and has accumulated a lot of points
but notice he doesn'tparticipate in many stations his unity is in the 60's
because it's docked due to his ties with Mutuality."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Do any of the courier services
pay better than any others?"
"If his unity was at 100 percent," says Lily, "he would be able to purchase at
the same level as Cats."

[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "I think you can only join
the one for your alliance, anyway."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That's not right. They're
corporate, so you can work for any of them that will have you."
[General Communication] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "Noget bolt from workb."

then."
[General Communication] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "Err, ignore me."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Today, they are angels..."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You can say that again."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson laughs.
"I'm not being very kind though as I'm weeding out the stumblers," Lily says.
"They tend to take over and I was down to just 2 sabre-tooth in the lemmo."
Lily says, "But they're coming back since I took a bunch to Hyperion and 4 today
so getting my good bunch of sabres back."
Lily says, "Going to go by the Xeno station to turn in some more artifacts."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
[General Communication] Paige McCormick transmits, "Oh. And I see a green one."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
K<O:47G1UmSS_;,bV)}W@P2?{#W0I+C@jI/=y58T
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "No green for me."
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a clear plastic food
storage container, and Xavier the big silver soldier felo here.

and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Emerald McKay"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
WD<(pR93}JDb>}w=p0aD}2TH&a[j!]I7-.71sYf8
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 3031 light-minutes per second from Galactic North and
Slightly Up."

[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Ball suits."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Outpost F-287. Local rift accelerator
with matching vector found."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Syrup."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
"Wow no toll?" asks Lily.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I can rock whatever."
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
