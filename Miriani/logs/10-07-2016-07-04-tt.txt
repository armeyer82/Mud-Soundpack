Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a small seashell pink trash can, an insulated green cooler, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated orange cooler, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.
Corey Matthews's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey Luja. Bye
Luja."
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
The room begins spinning around you.
Soraya Rhyz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Make that your final
regret."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the west.
Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to
one side.

Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to

A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming
countless mouths, gasping for relief.
You gag slightly.
You begin dry heaving.
The stage lights flicker briefly.

You begin dry heaving.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Destroyed alien starships and space stations fill space in this area. Unlike
similar sites, the damage appears to be rather one-sided, with most of the
debris consisting of non-military equipment that is nonetheless rather
battle-scorched.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and
advance into the fray.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Zéro Des Cartes/General.
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Aisling."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the west.

Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on
Lily Kaise's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.
An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the
fog.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches out.
The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.
An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the
fog.
A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
