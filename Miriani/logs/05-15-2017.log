[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

00:40 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:40 [TSS] Daniel Smith transmits, "Mmm."

00:40 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

00:40 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:41 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:41 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:41 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:43 You peer up and see...

00:43 ["Brutal Asset" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a glossy black captain's chair, a black leather recliner with diamond chips on the arms, and a starship-shaped red glass coffee table here.
You see Daniel Smith here.
You can go south, down, and out.

00:44 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:44 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

00:44 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:44 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:14 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:15 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

01:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

01:15 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Brutal Asset" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

01:18 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Ok, I'm back"

01:18 You peer up and see...

01:18 ["Brutal Asset" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see a glossy black captain's chair, a black leather recliner with diamond chips on the arms, and a starship-shaped red glass coffee table here.
You see Daniel Smith (sitting on a glossy black captain's chair) here.
You can go south, down, and out.

01:18 Daniel Smith's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "fantastic"

01:18 You hear several loud thuds as cargo is transferred from the ship.

01:18 You hear the bustle of activity from the ship's cargo hold.

01:18 The noises coming from the storage room gradually cease until they can be heard no more.

01:19 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Brutal Asset" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:19 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:19 Daniel Smith's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "am going to have to be done after this one unfortunatley, the disadvantage of being busy"

01:19 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:19 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "No problem."

01:20 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

01:20 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:20 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:20 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:20 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:20 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Brutal Asset" has initiated an intrasector slip.

01:20 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:20 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Brutal Asset" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

01:20 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:20 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:20 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:20 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:20 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:10 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the two-person asteroid hauler "Roid Roper", the one-person cargo hauler "Mephia", and the seven-person expeditioner "Packer" powered down here.

05:04 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a leather-covered oak navigator's chair, a metallic white starship simulator, an overstuffed royal blue leather love seat, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.

05:24 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

05:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:24 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:24 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

05:24 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

05:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

05:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

05:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

05:24 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

05:24 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

05:25 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

05:25 You peer northeast and see...

05:25 ["Determined Destination" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a yellow lab here.

05:26 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

05:26 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

05:26 Daniel Smith's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "undercrewed?"

05:26 Joseph Riddle's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Piped, sorry"

05:26 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

05:26 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

05:26 Joseph Riddle's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Nah, Tibo's here."

05:26 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

05:26 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:26 Daniel Smith's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Oh quiet."

05:36 ["Determined Destination" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

05:38 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

05:38 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

05:38 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

05:39 Joseph Riddle's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "will need to wait a bit for sub to charge, but then we're back in!"

05:39 You peer southwest and see...

05:39 ["Determined Destination" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a yellow lab here.
You see Doraleigh Soto (lying on the floor) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

05:39 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

05:39 I don't understand that ("armor" is an ambiguous name).

05:39 You need a free hand for that.

05:39 You are carrying a hollow cylindrical device in your left hand and a droid remote titled "Empanda" in your right hand.

05:39 You deftly insert a hollow cylindrical device into a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

05:39 I don't understand that ("armor" is an ambiguous name).

05:40 You begin carefully disconnecting pieces of armor from a bulky stun armor battery pack.

05:40 (20 seconds roundtime.)

05:40 Wait 2 seconds.

05:40 Wait 1 second.

05:40 You finish disconnecting armor from a bulky stun armor battery pack.

You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

05:40 You remove your stun armor and place each piece in the designated area in a black stun armor storage bag.

05:40 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

05:40 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

05:40 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

05:40 You must be in space to fire weapons.

05:40 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

05:40 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

05:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:49 You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

05:49 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

05:49 You peer southwest and see...

05:49 ["Determined Destination" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a yellow lab here.
You see Doraleigh Soto (lying on the floor) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

06:21 ["Determined Destination" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

06:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

06:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

06:24 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

06:24 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

06:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

06:24 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

06:24 There are no ships here.

06:24 The ship is already moving.

06:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

06:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

06:24 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

06:24 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

06:25 [General Communication] Joseph Riddle transmits, "One spot mods!"

06:25 There is no repair in progress.

06:25 The computer reports the starship is headed for Empanda Station (10, 12, 9). The computer estimates approximately 8 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

06:25 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

06:25 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

06:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

06:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:14 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Once Upon A Time", the one-person cargo hauler "Chasing Fortune", and the six-person sentinel "Diva" powered down here.

16:15 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

16:15 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

16:15 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:15 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

16:15 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:15 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:15 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:15 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:15 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

16:15 You must stand up first.

16:15 Jenaia the droid

16:15 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a red keychain with "beer lover for life" printed on it.
She is carrying nothing.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.
