["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

It is currently Alexander West's turn.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that th

15:09 ["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, and three glossy pink security drones here.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, and three glossy pink security drones here.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room] (indoors) (sitting on a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa)
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
