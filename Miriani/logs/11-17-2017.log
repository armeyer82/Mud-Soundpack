["Oblivion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a wide rectangular blue picture frame with kneeling angels engraved in each corner containing a picture of Lily Fisher, a skull and crossbones flag, and a dark tapestry depicting a battered starship descending through a stormy sky hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.

15:25 She looks like too much effort to carry.

15:25 A black leather briefcase
This black leather briefcase is simple and elegant in its design. Plain gold clasps hold the briefcase shut, and its carrying handles are lightly padded for comfort. Several pockets along the inner walls of the case are designed for holding papers and folders.
You see four armor repair kits, a small box labeled "Starlight Express", a small box labeled "Dolphin", a small box of Makincake instant pancake mix, a piece of purple stationery with a seashell border, an empty mug inscribed with Tibo Beauchene's name, a sleek white metal pancake griddle, a red universal drone remote labeled "Trans-E-F", a cork remover, a silver crown encrusted with diamonds, a large red hat with a giant stuffed panther perched on top, a builder host application, a drone remote, a soft leather ammunition storage belt, a picture of a kitty, a blue vest with 'Force' embroidered on the left breast, a camouflage vest with 'Force' embroidered on the left breast, a red keychain with "beer lover for life" printed on it, a droid remote titled "jenaia", a casual red muscle shirt which says "medraska's Nightclub" across the back, a bulky stun armor battery pack, a pocket knife with a red wooden handle, a small gray whetstone, a large clay sculpture of a woman, an application for the ten-person battlecruiser, a purple oxygen tank, a protective component container, a bottle of rose scented massage lotion, a bottle of lavender scented massage lotion, a gold glass

15:25 Are you sure you wish to boot Mekensie the droid? [Enter "yes" or "no"]

15:25 Mekensie the droid has been booted.

15:25 A security drone appears and drags Mekensie the droid off the ship.

15:25 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:25 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

15:25 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You c
15:25 an go south and out.

15:25 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black stun armor storage bag, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a red leather artifact storage container, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a red spacesuit jet, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, and a gray armor storage bag.

15:25 You are carrying a droid remote titled "angelus" in your left hand and a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in your right hand.

15:25 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:25 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

15:25 You're already sitting down.

15:26 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:26 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:26 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:26 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:26 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

15:26 The ship must be in space to do that.

15:26 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:26 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:26 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

15:26 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:26 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:26 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:26 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:26 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:26 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the eight-person gunship "Alpha Magnetic", the ten-person battlecruiser "Deliver Us In Flames", and the five-person transverser "Celestial Siren" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the droid, Kirsty the droid, Sl

The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.

16:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

16:36 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:36 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

16:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:37 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:37 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:37 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:37 The computer announces, "Four planets have been detected in the sector."

16:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 4."

16:37 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:37 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:37 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:37 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

16:37 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:37 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

16:37 You must stand up first.

16:37 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

Most of what might have once been an active spaceport is now run down and unused. Old buildings are now boarded up, a few torn down completely.

  Introduction:
Droids are humanoid robots that follow you around to do your bidding. Most models exist solely to protect you, but in addition to that they also possess the ability to store items and, most important of all, tell you the time and date.

  Commanding Droids:
To command a droid, you simply speak the droid's name followed by the command you wish to give. For example, to instruct your droid, Noodle, to follow you, you would type:

say Noodle, follow.

Or your favorite variation of the say command.

Remove [person/clothing] - Remove the person from the droids friends list or removes the clothing specified.
Friends - List the droids friends.
Authorise [person] - Allow  to command the droid.
Deauthorise [person] - Remove  from droid command list.
Owners - Lists who can control the droid.
Get [item] - Attempts to pick up an item.
Drop [item] - Drops [item]
Give [item] to [person] - Gives [item] to [person]
Contents - Lists the droids contents.
Holding - Tells what the droid is holding without telling what it has stored.
Store [item] - Stores [item] in droids storage compartment.
Unstore [item] - Retrieves [item] from storage.
Wear [item] - Dons [item].
Follow - Follows you around. Or stops following you around.
Remote - Enables remote mode.

16:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets have been detected in the sector."

16:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.

18:10 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

18:10 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

18:10 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

18:10 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

18:10 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

18:10 Enter a destination:

18:11 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

18:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:11 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

18:11 You're already sitting down.

18:11 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

18:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:11 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:11 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:11 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

18:11 The ship must be in space to do that.

18:11 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:11 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:11 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 7, 3."

18:11 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:11 Sector 25: Pegasus (The Hale Collective)

18:11 Galactic Coordinates: (-602662, 109, 417)

Debris: (4, 3, 15)
Jumpgates: (15, 5, 5)

Current Coordinates: (16, 10, 17)

18:11 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:11 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:11 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:11 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:11 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

18:11 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

18:11 You stand up.

18:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

This enormous central plaza area is full of the thundering sound of falling water which comes from the towering fountain at its center, the lighted tiers nearly reaching the opening of the level above. Surrounding the fountain in a square are several shallow wide steps on which a number of people are seated. A gleaming escalator set off to the right moves slowly upwards.

In keeping with the theme of this store, the white floor tiles are dotted with hundreds of tiny red hearts. A line of jewelry cases spans the length of the back wall. Mounted on the coral white wall above the cases are red wooden shelves holding rows of differently sized glass bottles. Rather than shelves on the left and right walls, enormous menu screens display the items for sale. From the demonstration depicted on a screen just inside the entrance, it appears as if a customer simply has to make their selections on the menu and their purchase will be brought out by a droid.

18:20 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at 51 Pegasi b; Balloonzia Circle Landing Pad.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go south and out.

18:27 A letter

Dear tibo My Love! I am so sad ... I know I had left my kids and robots in your trannie but here I noticed you had left. I initially thought you just went out for work ... then I saw my things in the garage. I didn't think much of it but I went over to Acrylon to look around in your trannie for some other things that I knew were still in there and I noticed that i no longer have a key! Pray to the stars ... what is wrong? What did I do for you to just leave me like this? I also checked the keys to the apartment and noticed yours was gone so I guess you threw that away? I then noticed you've deleted our private link and you're not allowing me to track you anymore. I know what I said the other day may have seemingly been hurtful towards you. I honestly meant nothing towards you at all. I just meant that I am so fed-up with the heavy-handed tactics of others. I would hate to be a new pilot these days, just trying to make a few credits and everytime they try to launch, they are hurled into a mine field and lose everything. I can afford it but they can't. I just find it painful to observe this going on day after day and my first inclination is to run away from all of this madness! You know too, I didn't say I would leave right away as I wanted you to have the opportunity to do more work and to decide if you truly wanted to go with me. I am enclosing another key to the apartment. You are still welcome anytime even if you don't w
18:27 ant to stay with me. I love you Tibo, more than you will ever know. Please come back ... oh please do come back. If you just can't, please then, I believe I do deserve an explanation as to why I was all of a sudden abandoned by the man who I consider to be the most awesome man in the Universe. I love you Tibo. - Kitty

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

18:35 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:35 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

18:35 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:38 [Miriani; Landing Area] (outdoors)
The reinforced steel of this massive landing site gleams in the multitude of lights glittering from the massive spaceport tower to the north. The curved structure spears up towards the sky, its exterior marked and colored with a vast array of murals and messages. Its many windows glow with blazing light, and enormous colored spotlights cast their beams down from the very top of the tower. A sculpted granite archway leads into the spaceport, and above it is a gold embossed plaque with engraved letters which read, Miriani Spirit tower. A lighted sign directing pilots to the spaceport garage is visible off to the left above a set of gleaming metal stairs which lead downward. In the far distance, at the gated edge of the landing site, there appears to be a small brick structure with several people gathered around it.

18:40 You can't launch from here.

18:40 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

18:40 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

18:40 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

18:40 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

18:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:40 The computer announces, "Three planets have been detected in the sector."

18:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:40 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 13, 6, 8."

18:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:40 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

18:40 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:41 You peer out and see...

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Rosario; Intergalactic Landing and Launch.

Two enormous white vases filled with a riot of exotic flowers stand either side of the carved double doors leading into this elegantly furnished foyer. Set in the middle of the plush red carpeted space is a polished wooden podium behind which stands a black suited maitre d'. The walls are papered in a soft cream silk which is decorated with an intricate paisley pattern, and a delicate gold and crystal chandelier hangs from the arched ceiling. A wide archway to the left leads off into one of the many dining rooms, and an open set of double doors leads north into a brightly lit corridor.

18:49 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

18:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:49 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Three planets have been detected in the sector."

18:49 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

18:49 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

18:49 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

18:49 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:49 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:49 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:49 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:49 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

18:49 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:49 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

18:49 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:49 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:49 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:49 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:49 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

18:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:50 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I love you."

18:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:50 You must stand up first.

18:50 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

18:50 You stand up.

This large room appears to serve a dual purpose: One is to purchase books and the other is to instantly publish them. Shelves upon shelves upon shelves fill the room, but in the back a large machine stands ready to instantly publish the book of your choice, making the shelves a redundant or decorative addition. A large banner hanging over the machine reads "SUBMIT your books today!" A smaller, much less prominent, sign indicates that you can also REDACT a book to remove it from the shelves.
You see a tasteful wire trash can here.
You can go west.

An intricate pattern of tiny translucent white tiles makes up the floor of this large well-lit art gallery. Sleek menu terminals which look like podiums more than anything else are situated around the room, each one glowing faintly in a different color. Taking up prominent position near the entrance is a simulated wooden menu terminal whose top resembles an open book. On the left side the screen glows with the word SUBMIT. The screen to the right reads, REDACT.
You can go east.

An intricate pattern of tiny translucent white tiles makes up the floor of this large well-lit art gallery. Sleek menu terminals which look like podiums more than anything else are situated around the room, each one glowing faintly in a different color. Taking up prominent position near the entrance is a simulated wooden menu terminal whose top resembles an open book. On the left side the screen glows with the word SUBMIT. The screen to the right reads, REDACT.

18:56 A canvas titled "Ledgend of The Christmas Tree Angel"
This painting has been split into several smaller panels. The pictures in each have been painted in vibrant colors that resemble those found in a commic book. The first shows a close up on santa claus. He is wearing his trademark red suit, and has a smile on his jolly face. He is sitting in an overstuffed easy chair with his feet up, and has a book in one hand. The second panel shows a messy kitchen. There is flour all over one of the counters, a large table in the center of the room is laiden with all shapes and sizes of cookie cutters, and there are measuring cups, spoons, plates, trays, and various other utencils spread across other surfaces. Santa is standing with Mrs. Claus and looking down at an open oven with a slightly annoied expression. A small tendril of smoke is curling up from a tray of blackened cookies on the rack in the oven. The third panel shows a room full of elves holding signs demanding more pay. A picket line has been formed near a large machine that is spitting out packages, and toys in various states of completion are stroon across the floor. Santa is standing in the doorway, and looking agrivated. The next panel shows an open air stable. Hay is everywhere, and several reindeer seem to be leaning drunkenly against the wall. Empty cans labeled Egg nog have been left lying all over the floor. Santa is standing in the center of everything looking mad. The next panel shows a festive sleigh with it's front
18:56  bumper wrapped around a large pine tree. Several elves are standing nearby looking guilty. Santa is assessing the dammage, and looks furious. There is smoke coming out of his ears. The next panel is showing the same comfortable living room depicted in the first. Santa is pacing, and glancing toward the door. There is still smoke coming out of his ears. The final panel shows a huge christmas tree being squeezed through the door of the living room by a small angel.. She is asking santa where he would like her to put the Christmas Tree. In gold test at the bottom of the painting is the caption, "And you've always wondered when we started putting Angels atop our Christmas trees."
It has been signed by Jade Starling.

19:13 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "it'sok i'm pretty busy looking through things and organizing a bit"

19:14 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:14 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

19:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:14 You don't see that here.

19:15 I don't understand that.

19:15 Enter a destination:

19:15 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:15 You're already sitting down.

19:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:15 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

19:15 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:15 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:15 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:15 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:15 The computer announces, "Three planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

19:15 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:15 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 15, 2, 9."

19:15 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:15 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:15 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:15 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

19:15 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:15 Space.

19:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:15 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

19:15 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

19:16 You peer out and see...

19:16 [Uranus; Landing Block]
In an amazing combination of the marvels of technology with the fury and beauty of nature, this landing block seems to simply float above, or in, the gasses of the planet itself. Beyond the edge and far below, swirls and bubbles of unknown substances dance around each other, hypnotic in their constant motion. The fact that the barriers which preserve life and environment on the landing block are invisible, only adds to the disorientation. On the north end of the block, a small building stands with its doors open and waiting.

19:16 This large piece of furniture consists of a short bench that sits before a round table set atop a platform. The table is spool-like in appearance, and clay can be formed on top, while the sculptor's feet can be used to rotate the surface, allowing creation of bowls and the like.
You see a red plastic clay storage bag on it.

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Uranus; Landing Block.

19:28 [Uranus; Landing Block]
In an amazing combination of the marvels of technology with the fury and beauty of nature, this landing block seems to simply float above, or in, the gasses of the planet itself. Beyond the edge and far below, swirls and bubbles of unknown substances dance around each other, hypnotic in their constant motion. The fact that the barriers which preserve life and environment on the landing block are invisible, only adds to the disorientation. On the north end of the block, a small building stands with its doors open and waiting.
You see Ju the droid here.

19:33 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

19:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

19:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:33 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

19:33 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

19:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and ou

20:46 You peer out and see...

20:46 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

20:59 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the one-person expediter "Starblast", the three-person antagonizer "Primordial Storm", and the three-person antagonizer "Ascendancy" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, Kitty the droid, and Mell the droid here.

20:59 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

20:59 [Private | Aaron Blade] You chuckle and transmit, "Not much. Just watching people battle Cria."

21:00 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

21:15 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.

21:54 ["Sparkling Wings" Engineering Room] (indoors)
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
