00:45:32 You peer out...

00:45:32 
[AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The four-person light carrier "Star Of Destiny", the two-person Accord space module scout "Probable Solution", and the two-person Accord gemini "Seventh Star" are parked here.

01:01:16 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a League Paladin, 
01:01:16 and an AEU Combat Universalist here.
You can go up and out.

01:01:17 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Airlock]

01:01:17 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:01:19 You exit the ship.

01:01:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hey love!"

01:01:36 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:01:44 Lily Kaise says, "Just hanging out up here."

01:01:47 You smile.

01:01:49 You say, "No problem."

01:01:56 Lily Kaise asks, "You ready?"

01:02:00 You say, "Yep."

01:02:08 Lily Kaise exclaims, "All right then, let's go!"

01:02:11 You grin.

01:02:12 Lily Kaise grins.

01:02:21 Some lights on the two-person Accord gemini "Seventh Star" flash as Lily Kaise boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

01:02:21 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:02:22 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]

01:02:22 You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a League Paladin, and an AEU Combat Universalist here.
You can go up and out.

01:02:23 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:02:24 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:02:26 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:02:39 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

01:02:44 A launch trajectory is located.

01:02:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:02:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:03:01 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

01:03:02 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

01:03:05 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

01:03:05 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:03:15 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:03:15 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:03:25 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

01:03:32 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

01:03:32 The tetras drift apart momentarily, then suddenly converge and flit in another direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.

01:03:52 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

01:03:52 The tetras drift apart momentarily, then suddenly converge and flit in another direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 0.0.

01:04:15 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

01:04:24 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

01:04:24 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:04:25 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

01:04:25 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 2.0.

01:04:39 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

01:04:44 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:51:46 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

01:51:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.

01:51:53 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

01:51:53 I don't understand that.

01:51:58 I don't understand that.

01:52:00 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

01:52:00 I don't understand that.

01:52:02 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

02:11:30 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:11:41 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:11:41 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:11:42 The starship has left a unique area of space.

02:11:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:11:51 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

02:12:00 You exclaim, "Woo! Ocean!"

02:12:12 Lily Kaise says, "Yay."

02:12:27 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:43:21 You've earned 15,000,000.00 AEU credits for exploring a Glyphmaker artifact.

02:43:21 0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:43:22 Lily Kaise lights her ascent rockets and returns to the ship.

02:43:23 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and hurl yourself down the corridor and out through the access point.

02:43:23 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:43:42 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hey Constantine?"

02:43:43 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

02:43:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.

02:43:44 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

02:43:44 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, Lily Kaise (League Paladin), and an AEU Combat Universalist here.
You can go up and out.
You collect the items you retrieved from the battle and place them into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

02:43:48 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:43:56 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

02:44:01 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:44:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:44:07 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:44:12 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

02:44:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yo."

02:44:14 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:44:16 Lily Kaise glides up.

02:44:20 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's up?"

02:44:27 Lily Kaise glides in from above.

02:44:27 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Would you be up for some Ground work?"

02:44:33 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:44:37 The starship transitions into another sector.

02:44:55 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

02:44:56 The starship transitions into another sector.

02:44:59 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't do anything too serious at the moment."

02:44:59 You're already sitting.

02:45:04 I don't understand that.

02:45:07 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:45:08 You turn on the silent running feature.

02:45:10 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sadly."

02:45:11 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:45:22 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Anytime in the next hour or so?"

02:45:54 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would think not for another two at least."

02:46:49 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Would anyone be up for Missions, Beacons, or even a Op. We do have six Canisters to still use up."

02:47:19 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I can do one of the other, but I'm still new and not the best in the world. Ground I got a tier 1 fringe. Gunning I'm about 15 to 25%."

02:47:26 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "And if it is a Op, I can do Salvage or Defense."

02:47:53 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Never done a salvage op, but I'd be up to do either part of it assuming you don't mind teaching me what I need to know."

02:48:18 [Tactical Communication] Mark Washington transmits, "I would, but I only have a grade 30 grapple."

02:48:50 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Then you two would most likely be on defense for this run."

02:56:34 The ship's current engine speed is 26667 km/s.

02:56:34 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 8.1 seconds.

02:56:41 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:56:50 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:56:54 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:57:45 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

02:57:48 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

02:57:53 Lily Kaise turns off the silent running feature.

02:57:54 You grin.

02:57:56 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:57:59 You say, "No idea."

02:58:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:29:28 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

03:29:28 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

04:13:42 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

04:13:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.

05:05:43 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

05:05:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go up and out.

05:05:44 Lily Kaise (League Paladin) returns from deep space.

05:05:52 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

05:05:52 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, a compact white refrigerator, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, an AEU Combat Universalist, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.
You collect the items you retrieved from the battle and place them into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

05:05:55 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:06:00 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

05:06:16 I don't understand that.

05:06:17 Lily Kaise says, "Haha if it weren't so late, I'd probably be able to do two more."

05:06:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:06:28 You say to Lily, "Yeah, I should start thinking about bed."

05:06:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly up.

05:06:50 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok so should we just go charge then or try to head back?"

05:07:10 You say, "Hmmm, either or. I can bring us back home when I wake up."

05:07:30 Lily Kaise says, "Let's see wht the flow looks like."

05:07:35 You say, "Ok."

05:07:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:07:36 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:07:40 You're already sitting.

05:07:41 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:07:45 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:07:46 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:07:46 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:07:47 The starship has left a unique area of space.

05:07:47 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:07:56 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

05:08:34 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:08:34 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:08:38 Lily Kaise says, "Wow doesn't lood very good m."

05:08:41 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:08:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station.

05:08:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:08:45 You nod.

05:08:55 Lily Kaise says, "We'll see though."

05:08:59 You say, "Ok."

05:09:04 Lily Kaise says, "Will go ahead and dock things."

05:09:08 You nod.

05:09:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:09:22 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

05:09:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

05:09:32 Lily Kaise glides up.

05:09:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:09:41 Lily Kaise glides in from above.

05:09:44 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

05:09:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:09:46 Lily Kaise glides out.

05:09:49 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:10:09 You peer out...

05:10:09 
[AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The four-person light carrier "Star Of Destiny" and the two-person Accord gemini "Seventh Star" are parked here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, up, and down.

05:11:21 You peer out...

05:11:21

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
The two-person Accord space module scout "Probable Solution" and the two-person Accord gemini "Seventh Star" are parked here.
You can go up.

05:11:23 You scramble to your feet.

05:11:23 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

05:11:24 You exit the ship.

05:11:25 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

05:11:25 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

05:11:25 You see a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

05:11:26 You say, "Hi."

05:11:31 Lily Kaise grins at you.

05:11:32 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:11:33 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:11:35 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:11:35 You grin.

05:11:43 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

05:12:13 Lily Kaise asks, "So hmm it's a little over a half hour should we go ahead or go charge?"

05:47:41 Lily gently rubs your back.

05:47:48 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:47:48 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:47:51 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

05:47:51 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "HELLO PEOPLE."

05:47:52 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

05:47:55 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:48:24 The starship transitions into another sector.

05:48:28 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:48:28 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

05:48:32 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:48:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Cross. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:48:33 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I'm so glad my comm has a channel toggle."

05:48:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Cross."

05:48:37 [General Communication] Johann Schraft laughs.

05:48:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:48:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:48:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:49:06 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:49:07 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yeah, a full load in an hlv gets you slightly less than a mine."

05:49:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to Gateway.

05:49:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:49:12 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Buttons!"

05:49:32 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:49:33 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We are 4 points shy of our Lab but we'll do this!"

05:49:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:49:56 You feel the ship shudder slightly as it approaches a quantum skim accelerator.

05:50:00 The computer announces, "Initiating connection with Gateway's local quantum skim accelerator network."

05:50:25 The computer announces, "Connection established. Communicating between quantum skim acceleration gates now."

05:50:45 Lily Kaise says, "We'll go turn in Artifacts and then go to Accord to take the proessor out to 285."

05:50:57 The computer announces, "Three."

05:50:58 The computer announces, "Two."

05:50:59 The computer announces, "One."

05:51:00 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initialized."

05:51:01 You feel the deck underneath you shudder violently, and you stumble slightly.

05:51:03 Lily Kaise yawns.

05:51:04 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am$thinking about a beacon soon."

05:51:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:51:06 The shuddering finally settles down.

05:51:11 The computer announces, "Skim initialization complete."

05:51:12 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We'll manage!"

05:51:19 You grin.

05:51:32 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Any int$rest?"

05:55:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:55:00 You grin.

05:55:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

05:55:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:55:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:55:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:55:07 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: "nI_#TdBgB;WAmXo.le.X/PW6.b@&[}CcznOjwrS
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:55:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:55:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:55:21 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:55:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

05:58:18 [League Xenological Solar Temporary Station; Docking Bay]

05:58:18 The four-person light carrier "Star Of Destiny" is parked here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

05:58:19 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep was."

05:58:21 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Airlock]

05:58:21 You see a row of flightlockers and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

05:58:22 I don't understand that.

05:58:24 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

05:58:24 You see a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

05:58:33 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Lily and Shule? Who are they?"

05:58:43 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:58:43 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Now we're going to take the new asteroid processor out to 285 and go crash and die."

05:58:49 You laugh.

05:58:50 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:58:50 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

05:58:53 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

05:58:59 A launch trajectory is located.

05:58:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:59:04 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Oh, just don't launch a very high bastille beacon then show up in a clipper!"

05:59:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:59:11 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

05:59:15 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:59:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:59:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

05:59:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:59:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:59:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:59:22 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:59:23 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

05:59:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:59:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:59:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:59:27 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:59:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

05:59:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:59:31 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:59:31 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh and install a lab."

05:59:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:59:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:59:32 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:59:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

05:59:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:59:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:59:37 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Fighting IFS in a clipper was interesting!"

05:59:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:59:38 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:59:41 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Star Of Destiny. Welcome to Accord space."

05:59:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:59:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

05:59:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:59:57 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You guys actually stayed? I wasn't going to touch that. I was having enough trouble with the ships I had."

06:00:06 Lily Kaise says, "Oh crap."

06:00:11 Lily Kaise says, "We forgot to transfer."

06:00:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We did. And fought it for a while."

06:00:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:00:16 You say, "I transfered."

06:00:20 You say, "I did it."

06:00:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:00:21 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.
Lily Kaise says, "We'll do that on the way out."

06:00:26 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

06:00:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:00:29 You say, "I already transferred."

06:00:32 Lily Kaise says, "Oh good."

06:00:35 You grin.

06:00:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:00:42 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't even think."

06:00:47 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

06:00:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:00:49 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I assume the outsiders fought the IFS."

06:00:50 Lily Kaise glides out.

06:00:51 You grin.

06:00:52 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:00:56 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Airlock]

06:00:57 You see a row of flightlockers and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

06:00:57 You exit the ship.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

06:01:02 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]

06:01:02 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

06:01:02 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

06:01:02 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

06:01:07 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

06:01:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:01:11 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "They did and then we fought the IFS."

06:01:12 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:01:24 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:01:25 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:01:25 I can't find "sofa."

06:01:28 You're already sitting.

06:01:29 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

06:01:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:01:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:01:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:01:47 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:01:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:01:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

06:01:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:01:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:01:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:01:54 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: N/h2rXeA|u/kA{6"29KD9t0aCH^Rz8?lE-je4HtL
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

06:02:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:02:04 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

06:02:29 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:02:30 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:02:31 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:10:42 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:11:06 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:12:34 Are you sure you wish to launch a temporary space station created out of a temporary space station core module (contributed by The Society For Harmonious Interstellar Teamwork) (attached), a basic control center module (contributed by Risoluto E Unisono Noblezza Espressione) (attached), an electromagnetic sifting asteroid processor module (contributed by Business Cats, Allied Libertarians, Spatial Stability, Morning Star, and Unlimited Potential) (attached), a fission breeder reactor module (contributed by Starseekers and Space Explorers Amidst The Stars) (attached), a storage container unmanned pickup module (contributed by Space Invaders) (attached), and a stealth sheathing module (contributed by Rift Surfers) (attached)?

06:12:34 [Enter `yes' or `no']

06:12:39 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All right Love do the deed!"

06:12:41 You press your back up against a temporary station with a temporary space station core module (contributed by The Society For Harmonious Interstellar Teamwork) (attached), a basic control center module (contributed by Risoluto E Unisono Noblezza Espressione) (attached), an electromagnetic sifting asteroid processor module (contributed by Business Cats, Allied Libertarians, Spatial Stability, Morning Star, and Unlimited Potential) (attached), a fission breeder reactor module (contributed by Starseekers and Space Explorers Amidst The Stars) (attached), a storage container unmanned pickup module (contributed by Space Invaders) (attached), and a stealth sheathing module (contributed by Rift Surfers) (attached), then slowly pushes it towards the open bay door, gradually building momentum, until it drifts out into empty space.

06:12:41 (30 seconds roundtime.)
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station in Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285.

06:12:52 A small light near the massive bay door blinks for a few seconds, then the door begins to slowly slide closed. After a moment, air begins to fill the bay.

06:13:11 [Enter `yes' or `no']

06:13:12 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

06:13:14 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Main Deck]

06:13:14 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

06:13:14 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

06:13:15 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

06:13:15 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

06:13:15 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok all of you roid heros! You're back in business!"

06:13:20 I can't find "sofa."

06:13:22 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:13:23 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

06:13:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:13:27 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

06:13:28 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yes, make us all megacredits!"

06:13:29 You laugh.

06:13:30 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:13:37 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:13:37 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

06:13:47 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:13:48 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:13:49 The starship has left a unique area of space.

06:13:49 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:13:58 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

06:15:35 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

06:15:42 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:16:32 Lily Kaise says, "Heh."

06:16:40 Lily Kaise says, "No need to vote for anybody."

06:16:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:16:44 You laugh.

06:16:46 You say, "Nope."

06:17:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

06:17:43 Lily Kaise says, "Will try to run Old FRontier by late this evening or in the morning."

06:17:47 You nod.

06:17:50 Lily Kaise says, "Old Frontier that is."

06:17:54 You nod.

06:17:54 You grin.

06:21:52 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:21:54 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:21:54 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

06:21:57 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

06:21:58 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:22:01 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

06:22:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:22:19 [Tactical Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Yeah, come to old earth."

06:22:29 The starship transitions into another sector.

06:22:29 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

06:22:29 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "I could join as well."

06:22:31 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2160 light-minutes per second from Galactic East and Very Slightly Up."

06:22:35 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

06:22:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:22:35 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

06:22:36 [Tactical Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Come on down."

06:22:39 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:22:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:22:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

06:22:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:22:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:22:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:22:47 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:22:47 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

06:22:53 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Nothing higher than tier two."

06:22:54 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:22:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:22:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:22:57 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:22:58 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

06:22:59 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:23:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:23:02 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:23:04 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

06:23:05 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

06:23:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

06:23:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:23:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:23:26 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

06:23:30 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

06:23:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:23:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:23:43 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

06:23:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:23:45 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Another IFS Ares at BAS station, it jumped out."

06:23:48 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:23:51 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

06:23:51 Lily Kaise glides out.

06:24:12 You laugh.

06:24:21 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:24:23 Lily Kaise says, "Ok off to spend a billion of org funds."

06:24:27 You laugh.

06:24:27 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:24:33 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

06:24:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:24:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Only a billion Love!"

06:24:42 Lily Kaise chuckles.

06:24:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:24:42 You grin.

06:24:45 You chuckle.

06:24:47 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "I could bring a rental, it could replace AEU. I have a League3, can change it with 2 if needed."

06:24:47 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:24:47 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:32:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

  WARNING: Nonstandard starship computer firmware upgrades detected!

14:13:08 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

14:13:30 [Starship "Kalina"; Main Deck]

14:13:31 You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

14:13:31 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

14:13:31 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

14:13:33 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:13:33 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:13:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:13:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have been given clearance to launch.

14:13:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:13:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:14:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Cross. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:14:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:14:03 I can't find "couch."

14:14:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Cross."

14:14:05 You sit down on a tiger stripe leather sofa.

14:14:06 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:14:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:14:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:20:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Shipyard Structure.

14:20:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:20:27 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

14:20:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

14:20:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:20:48 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

14:20:52 The computer receives no response, and begins docking procedures.

14:20:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:20:57 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

14:20:57 [Enter `yes' or `no']

14:20:58 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

14:20:59 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

14:20:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:21:00 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

14:21:02 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

14:21:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

14:21:04 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

14:21:09 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

14:21:10 You exit the ship.

14:21:10 [Shipyard Structure; Docking Bay]
The exploration vessel "Percival Lowell", the one-person cargo hauler "Nation", the one-person cargo hauler "Supernova20", and the four-person light carrier "Kalina" are landed here.

14:22:36 You begin the launch sequence.

14:22:41 The computer locates a launch trajectory.

14:22:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:22:51 The ship is already moving.

14:22:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:22:53 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:22:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:22:54 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

14:22:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:22:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:23:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:23:00 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:23:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

14:23:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:23:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:23:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:23:05 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:23:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:23:21  You are wearing a gold spacesuit helmet, a black spacesuit top with a red star on the right shoulder, a pair of black spacesuit gloves with a gold stripe around each cuff, a black spacesuit bottom with a red stripe down the outside of each leg, and a pair of black spacesuit boots with a gold stripe down each side. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of white cotton briefs, and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.

14:23:21 You are carrying nothing.

14:23:25 The ship's current engine speed is 5333 km/s.

14:23:25 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 13.5 seconds.

14:23:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:23:33 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:23:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalina. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:23:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:23:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:23:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:23:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:23:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:23:55 I don't understand that.

14:24:00 The ship is already moving.

14:32:47 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

14:32:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:32:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:32:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:32:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:32:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:33:02 The ship is already moving.

14:33:06 The ship is already moving.

14:33:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:33:07 Which sector did you mean?

14:33:08 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

14:33:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:33:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:33:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

14:33:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:33:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:33:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:33:17 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:33:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

14:33:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:33:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:33:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:33:22 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:33:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Beta).

14:33:25 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalina! Welcome to The Torus!"

14:33:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:34:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:34:00 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

14:34:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

14:34:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:34:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

14:34:19 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

14:34:19 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:18:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:19:40 There are no other ships in the sector.

15:19:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:19:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:19:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

15:19:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:19:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:19:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:19:50 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:19:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

15:19:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:19:55 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:19:58 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

15:36:30 Ted Warburton says, "Hmm, I forget how your gunships are set up."

15:36:41 You say, "Lasers and lasers and more lasers."

15:36:45 You laugh.

15:36:48 Ted Warburton says, "Need eng then."

15:36:54 You nod.

15:36:55 You say, "Yep."

15:37:12 You say to Ted, "Which engineering tools can you use?"

15:37:20 Ted Warburton says, "Everything."

15:37:31 You ask, "Can you use expert tools?"

15:37:38 Ted Warburton says, "I have 10 K industry now."

15:37:44 Ted Warburton says, "And enough tools for these."

15:37:44 A seagull flaps by the window.

15:37:46 You say, "Nice."

15:37:52 You say, "Cool."

15:38:06 You say, "You've just been volunteered as eng."

15:38:25 Ted Warburton says, "I've had some GMG, usually with Ali, I just really want to switch so I can get more, for points, parts, everything."

15:38:33 You ask, "You have minicannon resists?"

15:39:05 Ted Warburton says, "22 uses, and 80 or energy resists."

15:39:21 You say, "Ah, ok."

15:39:23 You say, "Cool."

15:39:42 Ted Warburton says, "You and Gonz don't get hit usually though."

15:39:45 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

15:39:55 You say, "Well, rapids can be rather unpredictable."

15:40:04 You say, "Not much we can do about those."

15:40:11 Ted Warburton says, "They can, I would always throw something if I saw rapids."

15:40:24 You say, "Yeah, minicannon resists help a lot."

15:40:28 Ted Warburton nods.

15:40:29 You grin.

15:40:45 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

15:40:58 Ted Warburton says, "I struggle for parts to make the energy resist, and I don't have the mini resist blueprint yet."

15:41:29 You say, "Well, I, along with others, can help make them for you. I have plenty of parts."

15:41:44 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

15:41:54 Ted Warburton says, "Thanks, I'm sure there are a good few of you who can."

15:42:02 You grin.

15:42:15 You say, "I keep over 150 uses of just about every tool."

15:42:27 You say, "Usually, more like 200."

15:42:33 Ted Warburton says, "Mine are mainly around 100 right now, apart from that."

15:42:39 You nod.

15:42:42 You say, "100 is good."

15:42:45 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

15:42:56 Ted Warburton says, "It's enough for today, I can make more then if I need to."

15:43:00 You nod.

15:43:35 Ted Warburton says, "I could easily go through that many recharges on your bloody ships, except it won't let me."

15:43:36 Ted Warburton laughs.

15:43:44 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

15:43:47 You laugh.

15:44:34 Ted Warburton says, "If we go with 4, I'll call one of the gunners to move to help."

15:44:44 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

15:45:05 You say, "I'll just have everyone leave room 3 open."

15:45:12 You say, "I can double when I need to."

15:45:19 Ted Warburton says, "OK."

15:45:55 Ted Warburton says, "Doubling 3 and eng is fun, in our torp boats and the like."

15:46:00 You grin.

15:46:01 You say, "Yep."

15:46:04 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Chuh Ching" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

15:46:13 Katina Faye just arrived.

15:46:14 Ted Warburton says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Gonz?"

15:46:21 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Those interested in beacons, come to New Earth please."

15:46:28 You hold Ted Warburton's hand, taking him into your group.

15:46:31 Hold who?

15:46:31 Ted Warburton stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

15:46:32 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the vostok-class capsule "Festina Lente" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

15:46:34 Gonzales Bourne just arrived.

15:46:35 You hold Katina Faye's hand, taking her into your group.

15:46:37 You stand up from a slim and fashionable couch.

15:46:55 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

15:46:55 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Ted Warburton, Katina Faye, and Gonzales Bourne are standing here.
You can go out.

15:47:41 You say, "Ah, ok."

15:47:42 Gonzales Bourne says, "Well whenever Ted and I are involved there's an undercrewed gunship."

15:47:46 You laugh.

15:47:49 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah right."

15:47:49 Katina Faye laughs quietly.

15:47:57 Ted Warburton says, "2 on a torp boat was fun."

15:48:00 Gonzales Bourne grins.

15:48:26 Katina Faye dances south.

15:48:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:48:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:48:30 Ted Warburton walks south.

15:48:30 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

15:48:38 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:48:38 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello old friend."

15:48:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:48:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:48:46 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oops, helps to launch the ship."

15:48:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Katina Faye is standing here.
You can go south and out.

16:21:37 You say, "Ok."

16:21:42 Katina Faye looks at you thoughtfully.

16:21:46 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:21:48 You say, "Had to get repairs."

16:21:51 Katina Faye nods.

16:21:57 You ask, "So, what was your question?"

16:22:07 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:22:12 Katina Faye asks, "Go for the thralls first unless it's a rapid?"

16:22:17 You say, "Exactly."

16:22:18 Katina Faye asks, "Ignore the corvettes?"

16:22:29 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:22:29 You say, "Corvettes can be thralls."

16:22:34 Katina Faye says, "Oh."

16:22:36 You say, "Adapas are also thralls."

16:22:41 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

16:22:42 You say, "And ninlils."

16:22:50 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:23:12 You say, "Get rid of adapas, and enkidu first."

16:23:14 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:23:22 Katina Faye nods.

16:23:23 You say, "And similar types."

16:23:34 Katina Faye asks, "So then if it's a corvette thrall, then go after it instead of the fighter?"

16:23:35 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:23:55 You say, "Also, it looked to me like you may have gotten a bit out of rhythm? And yeah, if it's a vette and a thrall go after it first."

16:24:01 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:24:13 You say, "Leave the cnt class ships alone for a bit."

16:24:19 Katina Faye says, "I pannicked when he said ftl out, and I panicked when I was surrounded by chains, and them, and debris."

16:24:20 You say, "At least, at first."

16:24:23 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

16:24:24 Katina Faye says, "I could barely move."

16:24:33 You nod.

16:24:35 You say, "It happens."

16:24:47 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Clear."

16:24:56 Katina Faye asks, "If we do another one, may I try again, or would you like to fly?"

16:25:03 You exclaim, "So, one strategy is to think of alternate moves in case you can't move to where you want to. And of course!"

16:25:09 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Sec."

16:25:13 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks though."

16:25:16 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No worries."

16:25:16 Katina Faye says, "My apologies, I'm too hard on myself, and want to get it right."

16:25:32 You say, "No problem. No need for apologies."

16:25:38 You say, "We all have our bad days."

16:25:54 You say, "So, for every move, try to think of at least two alternate moves."

16:25:55 Katina Faye says, "Yes, the one that sucks is if you're chained, and blocked by ships and debris, then you kind of have to be forced to go back in to their line of fire."

16:25:58 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hey all."

16:26:17 You say, "And also, feel free to salvage the debris."

16:26:23 You say, "I do it all the time."

16:26:26 Katina Faye asks, "It will let me move if I salvage it?"

16:26:31 You say, "Yep."

16:26:31 Katina Faye asks, "Can we try to get one more person?"

16:26:36 You say, "Of course."

16:26:42 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "One for beacons?"

16:26:51 Katina Faye glances at her cinnamon brown touch einrophone and checks her missed calls.

16:27:07 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Sure."

16:27:13 Katina Faye glances at her cinnamon brown touch einrophone and checks her voicemail.

16:27:14 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "New Earth please."

16:27:31 Katina Faye removes a cinnamon brown touch einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

16:27:32 You say, "And if it's a gilgamesh, it's also a thrall."

16:27:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:27:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:27:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:27:46 Katina Faye nods.

16:27:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:27:53 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:27:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:27:54 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:27:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:27:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:28:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:28:00 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:28:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:28:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:28:05 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:28:08 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Critical Strike! Welcome to home space!"

16:28:14 You say, "Also, don't be afraid to break contact."

16:28:18 You say, "If need be."

16:28:25 Katina Faye asks, "What you mean?"

16:28:26 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "On-n-n-ne moment, need-d-d-d medical I forgot."

16:28:29 Katina Faye asks, "Like run for a bit?"

16:28:34 You say, "Don't be afraid to move out of range."

16:28:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:28:37 Katina Faye nods.

16:28:53 You say, "You're priorities are evade, then stay in range."

16:29:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh dear, you OK?"

16:29:05 Katina Faye nods.

16:29:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:29:07 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:29:10 You pat Katina Faye on the back.

16:29:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Critical Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:29:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:29:20 You say to Katina, "Don't be too hard on yourself."

16:29:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:29:24 You hug Katina Faye.

16:29:28 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:29:28 You say, "I'm not mad at you."

16:29:31 You smile at Katina Faye.

16:29:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:29:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:29:41 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I will be."

16:29:41 Katina says to you, "Thanks."

16:29:47 Katina Faye says, "That makes it better."

16:29:52 You grin.

16:30:06 You say, "You at least knew when to ask for help and that's important."

16:30:10 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:53:59 You say to Katina, "Good job."

16:54:02 Katina Faye grins.

16:54:06 Katina Faye says, "That was better yay."

16:54:11 Katina smiles softly.

16:54:11 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Because people tend to fly into their locks."
