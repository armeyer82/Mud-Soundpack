The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

I personally have one and I just filled it with some milk, which was ordered from a food bot.

You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a silver king-sized pillow-top bed with an elegantly curving headboard, a long buffet table covered with a sapphire blue velvet tablecloth, and a tall clay sculpture of a willow tree here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a silver king-sized pillow-top bed with an elegantly curving headboard) here.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
