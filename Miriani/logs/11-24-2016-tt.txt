Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a compact
red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, a blue plastic food
storage container, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small gold
dragonflies, a pair of skinny white low rise jeans, and a pair of mystic purple
suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a Tardick
lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,
both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise
Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco in her right hand.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

You peer down...
[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Is it ok for me to have a word
with you once you have the time?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yes, but I'll need a few
minutes."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Sure, whenever."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Where do you want to meet?"
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh, Clarkson's Push is clear."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anywhere you want."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh hey, it's Mister Bentham."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "How do you make the commands for your
battle suit?"
Lily Kaise glides out.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Type commands."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "While inside the suit."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, that...forgot about that..."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rubs up against your ankle, purring

Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "Deploy brings the suit, what takes it away
again?"
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "Clear."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "But that's only in big ships."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "I think you don't have to."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you're in the low deps area or at
SVP, you don't have to."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "Is there a way to salvage the drones wen
you do that battle suit mission?"
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "No."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "You take the stuff that fall from it."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You can pick up the repair drones, energy
bottles, and detonators they drop."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Sometimes, rarely, they'll drop other
things too."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Fighting against different kinds of ground
enemies will yield different equipment."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "RATS ground enemies do drop parts, some of
which can be really valuable. So if you get a chance to go on a RATS nest with a
group, you ought to give it a try."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "Ok just got a 1 use repair drone and
energy bottle. Can I use the repair drones?"
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "To repair yourself yes, and it's one
use."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can. You'll need to go into commands
again."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "And what are the energy bottles for."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "Energy?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If your suit is an erergy hog, those
come in useful."
[Newbie Help] Johann Rowan transmits, "Certain abilities on certain suits use
energy, it just helps refill your reserves."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Your suit evades less when it is low on
energy, so if you are using a suit that relies on evasion for defense energy
bottles are very useful."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "Got a detenator. Guessing its some type of
explosive you can shoot at them fore more damage?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. It's a bomb, pretty much."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's a splash damage explosive, yeah."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "They're useful for drawing enemy attention
to you if the enemy focuses on someone that is having a problem, or for quickly
finishing off a group of weakened enemies, or just for doing some extra damage
if your basic weapons are not that great."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "I got the micro drone. How does that work.
Should have got the armor though."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz yawns.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Mornin'"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Oh wait, afternoon here
already, I think."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Yeah, Earth's weird."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Appreciate the tips Lily, but
the intent is to find one that hasn't already been pillaged."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup thought so we didn't though.
Anyways, good luck."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Javen the microdrone ability can do simple
repairs to battlesuits. If you assigned a command to it, you can just aim it at
yourself."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "For anyone that cares, trying
the same heading. We got tagged with a storm -right away- last time, and we
ended up being north and up from home space when we started off heading
eastsoutheast and very slightly down."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "What type of storm?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "No idea, no detector and I
don't have the parts for one right now."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "I figured it out. So what would be better
that or the armor. Also, what is that sonic thing."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Ahh."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sounds like you have a rental...the
microdrones would be more useful to you at this point. Sonics are a different
type of weapon."
[Newbie Help] Johann Rowan transmits, "Until you can get both, having the
ability to repair is more important."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "I do. Wich one is the other one."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "One of the other suits."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Blake, do you want your hull
plant before you leave?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Because if you want it now,
then you have to answer now since I'm about to wander off for the day."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK, we shall push it back until
you return again! Unless you want to mail me a key of the ship you want it in so
I can put it there to grow."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Has he already paid for it?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Enroute."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just have him mail me a key of
the ship so I can put it on there or someYou are not Blake."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Blake and I are on the pad!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Thanks!"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "So, there's apparently a rift
storm between Orion and the Bubble."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We just hit 9519 light-minutes
per second."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Cool!"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "Crap. Ran out of ammo on the ground
mission. What do I do?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Launch, buy more ammo, and deploy
again."
[Newbie Help] Javen Smith transmits, "Yo yo yo, ok. Was not sure you could do
that."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "The storm is an astable one,
just an FYI."

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

stations of unknown origin.

Subject: Time to practice what we preach
Author: Kim Saunders
Posted: 20:01 24 November 2316 GST
--
Hello all,
Although our meeting ended rather abruptly and after a rough and serious
conversation, I generally do think it was productive. I thank everyone for
attending and for your input and cooperation.
It is time that we try to move on now. Lily has appologized for her decision not
to return home once she learned the news, and unless she gives us a new reason
to doubt the sincerity of her words, we should leave it at that. Our statement
has also made the news. For anyone who was not in the meeting, we decided to
send the following messages in our statement.
1. A message of support and condolences to the victims and their families.
2. A call for peace and understanding, a call for the AEU citizens who are
involved in these acts of violence to stop what they are doing and think things
through. The hope that we can solve differences by communicating rather than
attacking and killing people.
3. We also put our support behind the statement the League, Fringe and Mutuality
pilots released earlier, and we expressed the hope that the people responsible
will be found and brought to justice.
I know it's been a tough week, and things were said that we all may regret. I
know that even I have said things, in anger and frustration, that I probably
could have worded differently, and I appologize for this. What matters now is
that we try to find common ground again from which we can move on and work
together. How can we preach peace and understanding when we are at each other's
throats? I hope we can all let past animosities go and turn a new leaf.
Then there is another thing I would like to address. Ather, I know you are not
fond of felo and see them as tools. I am not here to start another felo
discussion. no, i am not fond of what some people do to felo, you are not the
only one. we will probably never agree on the subject. It is up to the lawyers
and other such people to define whether felo should be treated the same as all
animals, and whether mutilating and killing them is a punishable offense or not.
But it is a hot topic among pilots from all alliances. I think it is walking a
very thin line when you openly defend felo mutilation.
I agree whole heartedly with a notice I received today from the liaison office.
If we on one hand preach cooperation,love, understanding and peace, and on the
other hand publicly argue with each other, attack each other, threaten each
other or state that animal mutilation is ok, we are contradicting ourselves. It
will send a very wrong signal and will give people even less a reason to trust
us. Now, I don't know who threatened who, this was just something the liaison
mentioned. This request is addressed to us all, whether you were at the meeting
or not, and yes, it includes me as well. Let's work together towards our goal of
understanding and peace. I know we can do it!
Take care,
Kim

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a dark gray leather captain's
chair, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go down and out.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

Subject: Belt of Orion Salvage/Xeno Station Up Again
Author: Akemi Bando
Posted: 19:45 24 November 2316 GST
--
I've put the station back up. Just as a reminder to everyone, the station runs
on a blast fusion chamber at full load, which means that it burns fuel fast. It
can hold 80,000 units of debris to fuel itself, but it burns through that much
every 22 hours. As long as the station is seeing regular use it's not an issue,
but when we have a lot of people out it is worth being mindful about keeping it
fueled up.
It may help to think of every 3,600 units of debris donated to the station as an
extra hour of life for it.
Should the station run out of fuel, it will go on emergency power. In that case,
whoever is available to take care of it has under an hour to get some debris
transferred to the station so that it can resume normal power mode.

You see a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold fleur-de-lys
in the center and thick gold fringe, a walnut rocking chair with a turquoise and

[Starship "William Dove"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
&"G-yFrj^%}'SfZ_[7tPevK"<Z^L#/iyJLDJ~&ia
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, welcome to Belt of Orion. Remember to watch your ship's charge, have
enough EAOS credits for tolls, and most importantly, fly safe!"

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
^m#;2\DQjFT3j`Ee@GBNV[!wAJmE7[kE7D=G$1_*
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Please only use lasers unless
otherwise directed. Thank you." and an overstuffed red chair here.

Subject: Time to practice what we preach

Hello all,
Although our meeting ended rather abruptly and after a rough and serious
conversation, I generally do think it was productive. I thank everyone for
attending and for your input and cooperation.
It is time that we try to move on now. Lily has appologized for her decision not
to return home once she learned the news, and unless she gives us a new reason
to doubt the sincerity of her words, we should leave it at that. Our statement
has also made the news. For anyone who was not in the meeting, we decided to
send the following messages in our statement.
1. A message of support and condolences to the victims and their families.
2. A call for peace and understanding, a call for the AEU citizens who are
involved in these acts of violence to stop what they are doing and think things
through. The hope that we can solve differences by communicating rather than
attacking and killing people.
3. We also put our support behind the statement the League, Fringe and Mutuality
pilots released earlier, and we expressed the hope that the people responsible
will be found and brought to justice.
I know it's been a tough week, and things were said that we all may regret. I
know that even I have said things, in anger and frustration, that I probably
could have worded differently, and I appologize for this. What matters now is
that we try to find common ground again from which we can move on and work
together. How can we preach peace and understanding when we are at each other's
throats? I hope we can all let past animosities go and turn a new leaf.
Then there is another thing I would like to address. Ather, I know you are not
fond of felo and see them as tools. I am not here to start another felo
discussion. no, i am not fond of what some people do to felo, you are not the
only one. we will probably never agree on the subject. It is up to the lawyers
and other such people to define whether felo should be treated the same as all
animals, and whether mutilating and killing them is a punishable offense or not.
But it is a hot topic among pilots from all alliances. I think it is walking a
very thin line when you openly defend felo mutilation.
I agree whole heartedly with a notice I received today from the liaison office.
If we on one hand preach cooperation,love, understanding and peace, and on the
other hand publicly argue with each other, attack each other, threaten each
other or state that animal mutilation is ok, we are contradicting ourselves. It
will send a very wrong signal and will give people even less a reason to trust
us. Now, I don't know who threatened who, this was just something the liaison
mentioned. This request is addressed to us all, whether you were at the meeting
or not, and yes, it includes me as well. Let's work together towards our goal of
understanding and peace. I know we can do it!
Take care,
Kim

Annie reacted to what others from I think it was either Fringe or League said
about Gray's intentions and so AEU defense went charging out to Andy's. I think
that is what happened but the situation was that she got information outside of
AEU and reacted in a manner which was quite an embarrassment. We were afraid for
aEU to go out to Andy's on their own."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips,
groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left
uncovered.

[Starship "Unicorn"; Control Room]
This control room would look less out of place as an old atmospheric fighter
cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able
to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The
nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that
one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the
pilot's controls. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a black leather sofa here.

Star Conquest Help: Starship Amenities

Category: Game Systems

Starships possess a few minor amenities to make long trips bearable!
SHIP'S HEAD
First of all, are you out in deep space and you really need to "go"? Never fear!
All starships have a ship's head! It's conveniently located in the storage room,
simply because there is no good place to put such a thing.
Ship's heads also possess a first aid kit for use in emergencies. These are kept
stocked automatically by alliance spaceports.
LIVING QUARTERS
Living quarters are the center of most amenities, logically! Living quarters are
typically found on larger ships, and tend to be centrally attached to a "hub"
room. This hub will possess a tiny, single shower that you can GO into. It has
the usual START and STOP commands.
Also in the hub, you may CLAIM a living quarters if you have a key to the ship.
This will lock a living quarters so that only you may enter it! If you wish to
give up your room, you may UNCLAIM it later.
If you own the ship, you may OVERRIDE a living quarters lock from the hub in
order to forcibly unclaim it.
Once inside the living quarters, you may ALLOW anyone you brought with you to
also be able to get past the lock. If you change your mind, you can DISALLOW a
person.

So...  There is a potential diatribe we could post for your eyes only.
It's a pretty important thing but it will not be a very nice one to read.  
But the Squidmind communed and we realised that in a situation similar to this,
we would do something akin to what we are suggesting here.  But it's up to you
guys - this diatribe could make you quite angry and upset.
Do we post it?

I'm sure this has been said already, but thanks for the hard work to make things
more real with smells and activity. sounds maybe silly but I enjoy the fact I
need to make sure I'm not smelling like a dead rotting fish after I've just
cleaned out my aquariums, or that after I've shoveled I'm all swetty and
smelling of hard work.

Hi,
I am honestly torn here. Most of your diatribes give some good thinking
material. On the other hand, I have just settled down from being darn angry. So,
I don't know.
I am sure it is not wrong that my character gets angry from time to time, but
when I as a player get angryer than my character, ouch. then i know I am doing
something wrong.
I hope what I am saying makes some sort of sense.

It started out as a diatribe and ended up more as an in-progress breakdown. 
What you say makes sense - if a character gets angry, that's roleplaying.  If a
player gets angry, there's a problem somewhere.
But that's three of four, so I think we'll count that as a pass.
Here goes.

motion or planned. This story arc has -IN ITS ENTIRETY- been set up, continued
and reinforced by you, the AEU players themselves.  All the staff have done is
have NPCs and the game world respond logically to repeated player action.
--
A GIANT'S REACH SHORTENS
--
With the conclusion to the opening Catalyst story arc, things calmed down
dramatically - combat was no longer a near-constant thing, invasions slowed, and
the playerbase were able to take a breath and enjoy their victory.  The AEU,
long known in SC Classic as the alliance for exploration, began to reclaim its
title with ships and upgrades superior to the other alliances for the purpose
of, well, exploring.  For some time, AEU starships and upgrades were simply the
best, by far, for distance travel and exploration.  This was intentional as the
AEU focus WAS exploration.
That's not to say that exploration was impossible for non-AEU players; in fact
much of the early exploration was done by non-AEU players using non-AEU
technology - starships and upgrades that were inferior to AEU versions, in fact.
 It appeared that though they had the best options available, the AEU players
were content to allow non-AEU players to do the bulk of the exploring using
non-AEU technology, perhaps being part of the crew but almost never initiating
exploration trips by themselves.
Two early expeditions WERE led by one AEU player, but after that this player
became content to merely join exploration missions rather than lead them - and
as things continued it became clear that the AEU playerbase as a whole had no
real interest in exploration.  Yes, they continued to SAY they wanted to explore
- but no one actually went out and did it.  
We had the AEU government (IE, us) suggest, we had them cajole, we had them
directly request that AEU pilots initiate and lead expeditions.  And still no
one initiated any exploration trips - instead many of the AEU players began to
focus on keeping temporary beacons online.  So as time went on, the alliances
who contained the players who DID explore gradually overtook the AEU in
exploration technology, while the AEU began to release technology more suited to
the tasks that AEU players were beginning to actively involving themselves.
The AEU was no longer the alliance of exploration, but of maintenance -
completely via player action.
--
DISSOLUTION OF TRUST
--
After the Catalyst arc the three main alliances (League, AEU, Fringe) had ended
up fairly close due to the near-extermination of humanity.  As time went on the
three alliances (through the actions of the players) grew closer still and ended
up with full alliances in an attempt to stop piracy and other conflict.  As
expected, the Mutuality was the outlier - originally (after an initial stumbling
block) the Mutuality had had relatively strong ties to the AEU and Fringe. 
However, as time went on events both staff and player initiated caused tension
between the Mutuality and both AEU and Fringe, leaving lasting scars and giving
the League a chance to swoop in and forge closer ties to the Mutuality.
And then the AEU pilot corps unilaterally decided to break diplomatic ties with
all the other alliances, remaining neutral to them all.  This was unexpected -
with the sheer amount of support for it from the AEU playerbase surprising us -
but the AEU players had spoken: the AEU would go it alone as the AEU playerbase
continued to reinforce their desire to separate from the other alliances.
The AEU had become increasingly isolationist, purely through player choice.
--
THE PRICE OF INACTION
--
One of the largest problems we have had in Star Conquest is the lack of active
decision-making by the playerbase.  While this is also an issue with major
plotlines and the playerbase as a whole, we will focus here on purely AEU
events, most of which were primarily player-driven and (unfortunately) far more
negative in outcome than events involving players from other alliances.
The Slavers
--
At one point, a non-AEU expedition discovered the unreg faction called the Feng
Wo Collective and several of their trading stations.  They learned a bit about
Feng Wo cultural mores and attitudes and took that information back home. 
Another expedition of other players (led by a League player, but with several
AEU players present) decided to find the Feng Wo and see what they had to offer.
When this second crew reached Feng Wo space, they brought their security robots
onto the station with them.  At the time, we considered having the Feng Wo react
badly to this and treat it as a hostile action; after all, this was a crew of
regs - people known to hate unregs - who had arrived in a powerful warship, and
had now brought out several weapons platforms.  But in the end we decided that
while that might have been the most logical approach it would have been a little
extreme, so instead we had the Feng Wo confiscate the robots and began what we
thought was a fun, minor mini-event to let them acquire the funds necessary to
pay the fine to get their robots back.
Without bogging this down with detail, suffice to say that the players decided
to take an unnecessary route to maximise profit rather than simply get their
robots back, and it involved buying and selling slaves.  When this information
came back to the AEU playerbase as a whole, they refused to take any action and
tacitly supported the actions of the 'slavers' by saying it 'wasn't that bad'
and that as they had apologised, it should be forgotten and people should 'move
on'.  
We have seen people comment both ICly and OOCly about the difference between the
response to the AEU and to the League.  The primary reason for the different
responses is that the League players immediately condemned the actions of the
lone League pilot involved, then worked fast to contact the Mutuality to find
out more information and took steps to both find the slaves ICly and to have the
government deal with their single League slaver.  In comparison, the AEU
playerbase spent their time telling other players to leave the AEU slavers alone
since they had 'apologised' and then telling people they would do something and
then not doing it.
This took alliance relations further down and had the AEU as a whole appear in a
worse position - in the end the AEU government (IE, the staff) had to force the
issue in order to get the AEU playerbase to acknowledge that slavery is in fact
bad.
Negotiation With Evil
--
A while after this, the Voice at the time was convinced to attempt to
re-establish diplomatic relations with the Mutuality.  However, this Voice was
known to make very public anti-Mutuality and anti-Mutuality Council comments,
even going so far as to call the Council itself 'evil'.  During the negotiations
the Voice was insulting, derogatory and ultimately made relations worse than
before.
When that term ended, the next Voice stated they would attempt to undo the
damage - yet listened to the previous Voice's suggestions when they attempted to
communicate with the Mutuality and in the end decided that it was not worth
continuing the effort.
The Voice after THAT made big claims that they would re-establish relations with
the Mutuality, yet made not a single effort to do so.
This was all very public at the time and made the AEU even more of a laughing
stock.
All Roads Lead to Helios
--
Another exploration trip led by someone who was not AEU.  Through a few minor
errors, an Outsider patrol stumbled over them and destroyed the ship.  This by
itself would have been frustrating for the players, but ultimately a footnote -
except for the fact that the AEU players who were part of the trip decided to
redirect the escape pod to Helios; a place that in-game is required to remain
hidden from the Outsiders at all costs.
This started a minor event which culminated in the Mutuality being forced to
make a choice - sacrifice thousands to potentially save millions, or take a risk
and save everyone... but sacrifice their only possible escape plan if things go
wrong.  
By itself, this would merely have had the Mutuality once again lower its opinion
of the AEU - which was already at rock bottom.  However, the AEU Voice at the
time decided to throw under a bus the AEU player who had redirected the pod -
they had taken a trip to Feng Wo space, and the AEU Voice suggested to the AEU
government that they were fleeing, implying that they had redirected the pod
intentionally and were now trying to evade consequences.
The only realistic response to this was for the AEU government to send a
military task force to capture the AEU player - except the AEU player was
already returning to AEU space; it was a shopping trip, not an attempt to
escape.  This resulted in yet another Mutuality/AEU diplomatic incident and had
the AEU once again lose face on an interstellar scale because of player
decisions.
A Man of Wealth and Taste
--
Most players are aware of the Allied Pirates; once-registered individuals who
have banded together under the banner of one Mister Kelsey, a mysterious yet
apparently refined and intellectual gentleman who has major issues with the
alliances - especially the EAOS.
Mister Kelsey occasionally adds his voice to discussion on General
Communications, often entering into discourse with the civilian pilots - much to
the chagrin of the alliance governments and the joy of the media.
A relatively new AEU player had convinced the AEU playerbase that they should be
Voice.  They did not know much about the political climate, about the current
situation with enemies and allies, or anything else.  They also did not see it
necessary to learn about these things, either - once again a small but important
negative incident for the AEU even without what followed.
After getting lost in deep space, another new AEU player and friend of the Voice
was rescued by Mister Kelsey - as he is wont to do now and then for reasons of
his own.  The player did not know who Mister Kelsey was and did not ask anyone
via Communicator who he was, either - but they were on the phone to the AEU
Voice, who also did not ask who Mister Kelsey was.  All they saw was 'Allied
Pirate', which should have given enough of a hint.  Instead, they expressed an
interest in meeting Mister Kelsey in person and an agreement was reached -
resulting in them being taken to the Allied Pirates base.
This resulted in this AEU player declaring that the Allied Pirates were a force
for good and ultimately become branded a traitor for their actions, while the
Voice of the AEU would end up actively defecting to the Allied Pirates thanks to
the first player's actions.  The rest of the AEU playerbase, as with the Slaver
situation, refused to condemn the actions of either player for a considerable
amount of time and attempted to ignore that the situation was taking place,
again until the AEU government (the staff) forced the issue.
The AEU government was very displeased and highly vocal about what it expected
from AEU pilots and the response to pirates, and made a point to indicate that
the AEU pilot corps was now treading on thin ice after so many prior missteps.
Renewed Hope
--
Seeing how much negativity had come from the AEU in recent times, the staff
decided that we needed to do something to allow the AEU to show some positivity
instead.  So - since the AEU players kept crying out that they wanted to explore
- we set up a government initiative known as the Explorer's Corps; a special
group that players could be invited into if they showed their exploration
expertise.
We had many good and fun things planned and hinted at several in-game, hoping to
inspire the AEU players - people who constantly said they wanted to explore - to
actually do so.
After several months, not a single AEU player had taken up the challenge.
The Krupin Report
--
A new AEU player.  Taken on an expedition led, once again, by someone not AEU. 
Tensions rise and - after an unusual event within the rift - explode.  The
player is sent home via escape pod and in revenge begins a campaign of character
assassination of the rest of the crew, who are still out in deep space, by
claiming that they are dangerous and have gone mad thanks to the rift.  Petty,
but potentially interesting.
The AEU players back in home space offer verbal support to their fellow AEUer,
but have little interest in actively doing anything to deal with a potentially
insane crew of skilled long-time pilots.  The options are that the AEU pilot is
lying or that a rift event has caused a crew of talented pilots to lose their
minds - there is no middle ground in this scenario, either the crew have gone
mad or they have not.  Yet the AEU playerbase said that they supported the AEU
player's statements, but that the crew going mad was 'probably not important'.
The AEU Voice at the time is tasked by the government to gather information to
determine how valid the claims are - and is told exactly how they can easily do
this (by using the Quantum Entanglement device linked to the expedition ship in
question).  They do not follow these guidelines, instead choosing to vaguely
agree with the claims made by the AEU pilot without offering specific details or
facts, and ultimately doing no research whatsoever into the claims.  When the
government informs the Voice that they require an active decision from them, the
Voice immediately takes the path of least resistance and buckles, calling the
player a liar - again after doing zero research into the matter.
Thus the player discusses their final plan - the extinction of ALL HUMANITY
through activating beacons in Mutuality space... to get revenge on a small crew
who sent them home to avoid infighting.  When this came out the AEU government
needed to act and immediately revoked the player's licence - but eventually
returned it after deciding that their ranting was hyperbole rather than insanity
or actual intent (an opinion shared by the AEU players), along with the fact
that she was unable to actively achieve said goal due to being banned from
Mutuality space.  The player ultimately ranted both ICly and OOCly about what
had happened and then deleted the character.
This was the final straw - after yet another outrageous situation, the AEU
government made good on its threats and stopped allowing cadets into the AEU
civilian pilot program.
--
Each of these mini-events, taken by themselves, is a problem but not
game-changing.  They could all have added to the game story and created useful
drama.  However, the consistency with which AEU players cause massively negative
story arcs to themselves and the AEU as a whole is impressive - and entirely
down to two problems that are not limited to AEU players, but are most extreme
with them:  inaction and doubling down.
The majority of players refuse to take a stand or make an active choice when
there is no 100% guarantee that they will benefit from doing so. Instead, they
will always take the path of least resistance and go with whatever decision is
easiest for them to make without having to do anything.
The few players who don't do this have a tendency to 'double down' - that is, to
continue to up the ante in whatever decision they have made until they reach
extreme levels, in the belief that once they've made a decision, it has to be
followed to the bitter end even if they know things will get worse; basically,
escalating a minor problem into a major one.
--
ELECTION FEVER
--
Our most recent attempt to give the AEU playerbase a chance to show us what they
wanted was something that had been planned for some time but never actually set
in motion - the first post-Resistance general election.  This, we thought, was a
chance to get some debate going about the future of the AEU!  What did the
players want?  What were they going to talk about?  What was going to be the
main focus?
The status quo and personal gain, apparently.  
The three 'main' candidates were fairly specific in their public policies.  
* Garner's focus was progress in the AEU as a whole and attempting to end its
isolation, but hardship for the pilot community.  
* Rebane's interests were in less government oversight, basically allowing the
pilots to remain as they were, but giving corporations a more powerful sphere of
influence within the main AEU and the civilian pilot corps.
* Best's choice was to continue the path laid out by the players - to remove its
vestigal interest in exploration, to continue its jingoistic obsession with
separating itself from the rest of the alliances while pushing for greater
glory.
We were not entirely surprised, though we were disappointed, to see almost the
entire AEU playerbase immediately latch on to Best's rhetoric without even a
token discussion.  Garner was bad and discounted because of his (fairly
reasonable) reaction to the constant and consistent problems that the AEU
civilian corps had caused.  Rebane was discounted as the middle road option. 
Best was supported because he promised toys and told people the AEU would be
great again.
Politics at its finest.
The election results themselves were always intended to be fairly even, with the
AEU playerbase vote OOCly swinging things one way or another.  Rebane was always
the outlier, with only a near-unanimous vote for her by the players likely to
elect her (OOCly, of course).  The real battle was of course Garner versus Best.
 
100% of the player vote went to Best.  So of course that pushed him to victory.
The AEU pilots chose jingoistic fascism.  Now they reap the rewards of what has
been sown.
--
CONCLUSION
--
Star Conquest is a roleplaying game, and the staff enjoy putting on events and
story arcs both large and small.  But we can only do so with player engagement -
and consistently negative outcomes is as hard for us as it is for the players.
We have been concerned about the direction the AEU has been taking for some
time, but if the ultimate choice of the playerbase is to have events transpire
where the AEU eventually reaches an untenable position, we will go that route.
However, if that is NOT the route that AEU players want to take, we cannot stop
that from happening without player help.  If you want positive things to happen,
you need to MAKE them happen.  If you want improvement to the AEU, be that
improvement.
There are no quick fixes to this.  This has been a situation four real life
years in the making.  Every time we have tried to set up a situation to make
things better for the AEU the response (or lack thereof) of the AEU playerbase
has made it so much worse, to the point where we actually worry about making
further attempts to give options to fix things because we fear the inevitable
result.
One consistent comment we have seen is the line that the AEU should develop
better exploration tech.  If you want better exploration technology, show it
will be used.  EXPLORE.  Lead expeditions.  Find new things.  Technology doesn't
improve because people ask for it, it improves because it's profitable to work
on it, because people use what they have already.
The League, the Mutuality, and the Fringe all get new toys related to what their
players DO, not what they SAY.  The same applies to the AEU.  If AEU players
actually explore, the AEU will develop more exploration tech.  If all you do is
SAY you want more toys, you will get absolutely nothing.  
If things continue as they have, the AEU will continue as it is and will
eventually either collapse in on itself or start a confrontation on multiple
fronts that can only end one way...
And if it does, it will be entirely your fault.

Hi,
I am not angry. Do I like this situation? No, I don't. But it is at least for 99
percent true.
There is one minor thing I do want to comment on today. Although my character's
exploration trip was not a policy 14, she still tried to organize some
exploration. i had my reasons for taking the trip this way, it was meant to be a
preparation for more exploration trips, some possibly might end up as policy 14
events. i just wanted to get my character to try and run something, learn how to
organize stuff, how to take responsibility for an entire crew, the things she
would need to be aware of and prepare. It wasn't just for my character a
learning experience, for me as a player as well. It is regretable that only 2
other AEU characters showed any sort of interest in joining that trip.
There is a lot more that I could say here, a lot more that I should say here
probably, but I will need some time to think certain things through.
to be continued.

Thank you for posting that. Although reading it may have stirred up some

It has given me much to think about. I do have one question though and I'm sure
I'll have more later. When referring to "exploration tech" and its lack of use,
are we talking specifically of just focusing on using AEU tech more? I know some
of us have or have looked into obtaining a tactical platform with attached
sightseers as a large exploration ship. However, this does not use any specific
AEU exploration ships.

Thank you for posting that. Although reading it may have stirred up some
frustrations and strong feelings, I know personally that I needed to read that.
It has given me much to think about. I do have one question though and I'm sure
I'll have more later. When referring to "exploration tech" and its lack of use,
are we talking specifically of just focusing on using AEU tech more? I know some
of us have or have looked into obtaining a tactical platform with attached
sightseers as a large exploration ship. However, this does not use any specific
AEU exploration ships.

The fighter and heavy bomber listed in this section are generally similar to the
ones rented at Tannhauser, save for the fact that I'm pretty sure they start out
with stock upgrades and have to be upgraded by the long-term renter. The modular
tactical platform and the Modular Terrorerotici both can only have
corporation-based fighters such as the hyperion ships or the ones rented either
short-term or long-term by Agnar attached to them as far as we've deduced, as
well as the shuttles manufactured by corporations such as Hermes or United. You
can attach the ships to the platforms only from space. Note: the docking bay
size of the tactical platform and the Terrorerotici will increase depending on
the types of ships you have attached to them.

If you want to own a six-person ship to do stuff in and don't quite qualify for
the Pincer, then this ship is for you! It has fewer weapons, but would be able
to perform well enough in a fight with decent upgrades. It does however require
you to fill out an application, and approval or denial notifications may take
some time to reach you, but you'll be notified by mail regardless.

Star Conquest Help: Space Geography

Category: Game Systems

Star Conquest has a fully-realized space system as one of its primary features.
Space is big and it can be confusing. Sometimes intentionally! But here are the
basics.
SECTORS
Space is divided into sectors, which are simply a way of marking off and
differentiating volumes of space.
Sectors are three-dimensional, and are further subdivided into coordinates: 20
by 20 by 20.
Numbers! Each sector is 240,000km across on each axis, or about 1/625th of an
astronomical unit, or about 8/10ths of a light-second. So, a lightyear is just
shy of 40 million sectors. This would be common knowledge among pilots.
BEACONS
A sector exists because a beacon has been placed there broadcasting its
location. This beacon is what allows starships to jump there using their
wormhole drive.
Beacons can be based on planets, on space stations, or free-floating in a beacon
housing.
There are three types of beacons you'll commonly encounter:
* Primary beacons: These are beacons for main sectors that you can jump to from
any location (with a few exceptions). Examples are Earthgate, Providence Gate,
or the Dusty Reaches. These are primary thoroughfares and also act as travel
bottlenecks.
* Secondary beacons: These are used within a sector cluster. For instance, Old
Earth Orbit and Martian Orbit are both marked by secondary beacons. What this
means is that from another sector cluster, you would first have to jump to
Earthgate, because that is the primary beacon for the cluster. From there, you
can jump to Old Earth or Mars, the secondary beacons.
* Weak beacons: These are not really a separate category, because primary or
secondary beacons can also be weak. Weak beacons do not broadcast over a wide
range, and generally a ship's computer must know of its approximate location
before it can scan for a weak beacon. Scanning will still usually take several
attempts. Weak beacons are used in Mutuality space to help it remain hidden.
SECURITY
Sectors also each have a security rating describing the degree of safety you can
expect there. Check the SECURITY RATINGS help file for more information.
MOVING BETWEEN SECTORS
You can travel to other sectors with your starship's JUMP command. You can type
this command by itself for a list of accessible sectors, or you can type JUMP
[sector name] to start traveling there immediately. For instance, JUMP EARTHGATE
will take you straight to the Earthgate sector from most locations.
Your starship can also successfully navigate multiple jumps. For instance, if
you're in a distant sector cluster and you type JUMP OLD EARTH, your ship will
automatically travel first to Earthgate and then make a second jump to Old Earth
Orbit. Linked jumps such as these will occur faster and use less battery charge
than if you performed the jumps individually.

Subject: Re: DIATRIBE OF FURY: THE FALL OF THE AEU
Author: atherj
Posted: Fri Nov 25 22:35:22 2016 UTC

I'm going to try to cover as many of your points as I can in this post. However,
they will not be in order, so I will offer quotes from your posts and my
explanations of why I put in those quotes.
"As expected, the Mutuality was the outlier - originally (after an initial
stumbling block) the Mutuality had had relatively strong ties to the AEU and
Fringe. However, as time went on events both staff and player initiated caused
tension between the Mutuality and both AEU and Fringe, leaving lasting scars and
giving the League a chance to swoop in and forge closer ties to the Mutuality."
I don't know where that particular thing is coming from. In my experiences (and
I was around since pretty much the opening events) the Mutuality never had
strong ties with the AEU. Especially after the whole AEU rogue navy disaster
which was not player-initiated. That was all followed closely by the weapon
platform incidents around gateway, where we also shot down a Mutuality sponsored
pilot's vessel in an AEU ship, though that could be one of the staff-initiated
event arcs that you were referring to in your post.
"And then the AEU pilot corps unilaterally decided to break diplomatic ties with
all the other alliances, remaining neutral to them all."
A vote was taken on that proposal, and agreed on by the majority of the active
pilots. So, I don't see why this was a surprise. Being the person who initiated
this (it's alright, I'll call myself out) I wanted to see what would happen if
the alliance stood alone, without piggybacking on other alliances for help other
than free trade and the like. I don't know what's wrong with that, and I still
don't see anything wrong with that. We weren't rewarded for that initiative
though, probably because of the other things that I will be covering further
down. Keep reading!
I'm not going to cover the slaver issue in great detail. I've already written
several things about the entire thing in other message board threads, and made
my displeasure about how the whole thing was handled both OOCly and ICly quite
clearly. If people want additional information, I'll jot down my thoughts.
"A while after this, the Voice at the time was convinced to attempt to
re-establish diplomatic relations with the Mutuality."
Again, I don't mind calling myself out. Yep, totally me again. All happened as
was said. Pretty much in the entire paragraph. With further elaboration as
stated previously in-character basically covering it: why bother bowing and
scraping to them when they want us to move mountains that are unmoveable?
"After getting lost in deep space, another new AEU player and friend of the
Voice was rescued by Mister Kelsey - as he is wont to do now and then for
reasons of his own."
Please give me another example of this instance ever occuring again? I've never
heard about this kind of thing happening except for that one particular instance
unless we're counting invasions for some inexplicable reason. Granted, the
events that transpired were entirely the fault of the people involved.
Otherwise, let us press on, shall we?
"The rest of the AEU playerbase, as with the Slaver situation, refused to
condemn the actions of either player for a considerable amount of time and
attempted to ignore that the situation was taking place, again until the AEU
government (the staff) forced the issue."
I don't know where that's coming from, as I pretty much condemned their actions
from day one, and when I had discussions with the voice behind closed doors,
told them that Mr. Kelsey should not be trusted. I didn't hear any other AEU
pilots defending them either at the time, though I also do not recall any other
remarks of public condemnation.
"Seeing how much negativity had come from the AEU in recent times, the staff
decided that we needed to do something to allow the AEU to show some positivity
instead. So - since the AEU players kept crying out that they wanted to explore
- we set up a government initiative known as the Explorer's Corps
a special group that players could be invited into if they showed their
exploration expertise."
Lovely idea. From an OOC perspective though, I've honestly been idle more than
active for the last several months. I've had a lot of stuff on my plate, been
hanging out more with friends, spending more time with family etc. That's about
as OOCly detailed as I'd like to get about my life on a public forum in a game
where I'd rather not establish a deep relationship with other players on an OOC
basis. Anyway, that's the big thing that's always kept me from leading
expeditions.
I don't have any particular quotes from the election that I want to use, so i'll
just try to cover it in detail here. Garner: my player didn't want him because
he still believes, perhaps naively that the AEU can stand alone and with a bit
of hard work, accomplish what they want to accomplish, doing it better than
everyone else because they had to work so hard for it. Rebane: sounded a bit too
passive for me, honestly. Best: let's make the AEU great again! Something that
resonated with my player's beliefs, even if he didn't agree with all of Best's
ideas on how to make the AEU great again. However, he spoke to my player's
personal beliefs about how the AEU can stand alone, and still be a great
alliance. Unfortunately, I believe too much OOC has been taken from this
situation. Perhaps a bit by the players, and a bit by the staff as well. A lot
of what has been happening in the AEU election, and the real-life presidential
election in the United States has been remarkably similar. That's been obvious
for several months, but not pointed out by a lot of people that I've seen. Which
honestly, is a bit disheartening to the OOC me. I go to this game to get away
from real-life election stuff and all the political crap that goes with it. If I
want to read about it, all I have to do is look at my twitter timeline. Now
though, I get to see it ingame too, which is...just eh, in my opinion.
At this point and time, I honestly don't know where I want the AEU to go. We've
had a lot happen in recent years where it feels like certain players
intentionally wanted to sabotage the alliance for some reason or other (no, I
don't believe that remaining at non-aggression pact levels is actually sabotage
before anyone tries to point fingers at my player). Anyway, it just feels like
all possible avenues at redemption have been closed off. Some of it is player
fault, but some of it is definitely staff fault too. There have been things that
have been done and said which were then taken to extreme levels by staff-driven
roleplay. I will only grant that yes, often times, the staff-driven roleplay was
a result of a player's action. However, I will still say that some of it has
been extreme. I will provide examples if you'd like.
That's all for now though. Flame away.

Upon reading what Atherj posted, and digesting a few things from the original
post, there are some things I will try to comment on.
Tatiana. The first thought my character had when Syona and Tatiana arrived back
home was, oh god, what did they do. It was the first time crew members were sent
home from a trip. I had not been playing for personal reasons for a while, so my
character did not know either one of these people. But she knew Nissi as a
decent and balanced person, Anfisa as a skilled person, maybe with a temper but
not entirely without reason. The exact accusation Tatiana made was unknown to my
character until the message on the qe from metal heart arrived. You say there is
no in the middle but I don't agree with you there. My character trusted the
people on that ship to make the right decisions, generally. It was not
unreasonable to expect that Tatiana and Syona were overwhelmed with what
happened during a trip, these trips are not for everyone. It is also not
entirely known what rift entities can do. Did they offend someone, was it the
pressure from all being stuck in a ship? Or was something really wrong with the
crew. So, Tatiana and Syona could have overreacted, or they could have said
something that may have offended someone,without talking with everyone, it was
not easy to learn. So I had my character investigate, talk with Tatiana because
Syona was unavailable. As the conversation continued, it became clear from some
of the things Tatiana said to my character, that, pardon the expression, she had
a screw loose. But without the crew home to actually talk to them, it was still
not easy to figure out what exactly happened. The thought that Tatiana was just
overwhelmed by events during the trip lost merrit though, and the news story on
the holovid took any remaining doubt my character had away, Tatiana must have
done something to upset or annoy this crew, the way she talked to my character,
and then the mentions of revenge, quarentine being the next best thing. Before
that point, my character gave Tatiana the benifit of the doubt, then the benifit
of the doubt was gone, and that is how I roleplayed the story from then on,
including having my character propose she'd be removed from office. This only
after several more attempts of getting her to admit to the truth. Talking with
Tatiana had become increasingly impossible, simply because from the way she
talked, you just never could be sure whether she meant it. And what the secret
plan was? The only people who finally got Tatiana to the point of telling them,
never told any of us, so when the government learned, that was also the first my
character heard about the plan to launch beacons in mutuality space using a
league ship. And I can not remember that my character ever said things that
suggested she did not take what Tatiana was threatening seriously. I remember a
very frustrated conversation in which several of us tried to get Tatiana to see
how wrong she was, how terrible it was what she threatened. That it was no joke,
and it all glanced off her like it didn't matter. And a week later she had her
license back, after which she deleted her character. And I remember thinking,
what the....
As for the incident with Jonathan and Annie, where she stated that Jonathan had
ran from his responsibility and redirected the rescue pod on purpose... Maybe we
didn't throw her out of office for it when we should have done that, but stating
that none of us ever reacted, that no one ever got angry with her, is also not
true. I remember a very overheated conversation in the office, and after Annie
failed to blame it on Jonathan, she tried to throw my character under the bus.
She, oh I might as well just use her name here, Kim, upon learning that Jonathan
had redirected the rescue pod to Helios and what danger was about to arise from
that, said that we should talk to Jonathan and have a general discussion about
how we were going to fix this. A week later, she claimed that Kim had wanted her
to file a report with the liaison office that Jonathan had ran away with the
intention to escape. This was never said, and there were some very angry words
about it.
Don't get me wrong, I am not pretending I didn't make mistakes, that things I
did, or didn't do haven't added to this situation. The slave trades are the
worst example of what inaction can lead to, and as a player I sure have done a
lot of nothing in that department. And even in the past 2 years there are a
number of incidents where my character got upset, but maybe did not do all the
things she could have done to work towards a change.
I unfortunately so have to agree with Atherj on the comparison between real life
and SC presidents. That part was really not evident to me, I did not consider
it, until this violence thing got thrown in the mix.
No, I don't want to see the AEU continue down hill like this. It is a very sad
thing and honestly started long before I ever knew about the existance of Star
Conquest, and involves characters and players who are not in the picture
anymore. I see where Gordon and the other hosts are coming from, I also see a
few things where atherj may have a point. I am honestly not sure where to begin
fixing this, but I will sleep on it.
Have a nice evening everyone.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a felo nest, a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl, a sleeping big
violet soldier felo, a big violet bobtailed felo, a hefty violet soldier felo

This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened
metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow
lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate
where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent
atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs
is emitting a steady hum, indicating that it should be replaced. A ramp leads up
to the rest of the station.

Star Conquest Help: Events
--
This game is Roleplay Enforced, which means that you should have your character
act in a manner consistent with the profile you will write in order to leave
cadethood.  This also means that your actions will have consequences, both
positive and negative, depending on those actions.  
There are four major types of event in Star Conquest:
1) Story Arc Plotlines
- These events are game-wide and will happen at specific points, when things
in-game set them up.  These have included First Contact with the Jinu, the
Renegade War, the Rebellion against the Outsiders and Diplomacy with the
Children of the Sun, to name a few.  
- Anyone who wishes to take part in these events will be able to join in, but
some parts may only be open to people who meet specific criteria. These events
will occur whether one particular person may want them to or not, but the
outcome may depend on player participation. 
2) Personal Event
- When the player of a character wants to enhance their roleplay in a way that
requires staff intervention but is not game-wide, the personal event comes into
play.  They are technically host-run, but will have the input of the player who
has specifically requested it.  They will usually be minor events in-universe,
but the more people involved, the greater the event will become.  
- These are covered by Policy 14, and will ONLY occur when a player has
specifically spoken to a staff member to request one, and this has been
discussed at length.  While a player can request specific things, it is
ultimately up to the staff to decide how the event is implemented, though we
will do what we can to keep things as requested while remaining in-theme with
the game universe.
3) Consequences
- NPCs will respond to the actions of a character or group of characters.  Meet
with a government official?  Maybe your actions can result in something that
will benefit your entire alliance!  Or maybe you attack another alliance's navy,
and the target blacklists you for a time, stopping you from accessing their
space.  These consequences will always make sense and will always be logical,
even if you are not aware of the entire sequence of events leading up to them.  
- Consequences to your character's IC actions will occur whether you want them
to or not, and if the actions of your character are extreme enough this will be
stressed ICly and eventually, if it continues to the point that your character
nears unplayability, you will be notified OOCly to make sure that you are aware
of the inevitable result.
4) Outside Interference
- Sometimes unexpected things can happen, things you never expected but that
affect you in minor (or possibly major) ways.  These 'Outside Interference'
events will happen unexpectedly and may alter your character without your
explicit consent.
- These events are OPT-IN only.  If you wish to be considered for participation
in such events, check your OPTIONS command, which will let you toggle whether
you are interested or not.  Unless you specifically opt-in using this command,
you will never have to worry about these events occuring to you.  These events
are random and unique, so even if you have opted in you may not experience
anything for quite some time.
NOTE: This is not something you can toggle freely at will. If you wish to
opt-in, please keep in mind that this is a one-time option.  If you subsequently
opt-out again, you are PERMANENTLY opted out.  You can never again opt in.

Star Conquest Help: Exploration
--
Category: Activities
--
Exploration, in terms of activities, is simply the act of venturing into
uncharted space and discovering artifacts, abandoned space stations, and objects
of that nature. In the wider sense, exploration is the act of making entirely
new discoveries: unique structures in space, previously unknown human
settlements, and perhaps even new alien species.
An explorer's career can begin upon achieving 300 industry points, purchasing an
AutoVector unit, and looking for relatively intact debris from before or during
the Outsider War. From there, there is a progression of ever more exotic and
distant artifacts and things to explore.
Making entirely new discoveries is something completely different; it requires
careful planning, good roleplaying, and contact with the staff, usually invoking
Policy 14: Minievents. Each new discovery is something truly unique and requires
new designs and new writing from the staff.
If you wish for your character to make unique discoveries, you should first lay
the groundwork. Does your character concept describe an explorer, or someone who
would be more content with staying nearby and making money? Have you played your
character as someone with the curiosity to make new discoveries? If your
character has been more of a homebody, you should start by simply exploring with
the resources available. Take some trips in the vicinity of local space for the
joy of it. Travel to some of the nearby known destinations. Travel straight out
for a couple of hundred lightyears, traveling through the night, then come back.
None of these things require staff involvement, and by spending some time
gradually establishing your character as one with curiosity and a drive to
explore, you will have a character more likely to receive serious staff
attention in an exploration endeavor. A character who has made a career of
sitting in a mining center but who suddenly wants to discover aliens 3,000
light-years away seems far less plausible than a character who has already been
exploring at every opportunity who has the same end goal. Remember, Christopher
Columbus was on the sea all his life -- he didn't suddenly give up a career as a
sedentary banker in Genoa and stumble straight into America.
If your character is an established explorer and has a sensible goal, the next
step is to plan. New discoveries aren't made on a day trip -- you must plan to
push the limits of your ship. How much battery time does your ship have? How are
you going to recharge it? Who is your crew? Do they have the skills you will
need for a successful journey? How far do you plan to go? How are you going to
navigate? What is your backup plan? If you can answer all of these questions and
have a properly prepared ship and crew, you may be ready to make a new unique
discovery.
At some point in this process, you should contact the staff about your
minievent. Policy 14 applies to events such as these, and the staff are more
likely to be interested in your proposal if the following things are true: 1)
Your character has been roleplayed well and with consistency. 2) You are
including many characters -- a full house aboard, not just the two or three
people you normally interact with. 3) You have provided us with a sensible goal
for your character. 4) You are not attempting to dictate what you find. For
example, your character may wish to make an expedition 2,000 light-years
Coreward, which makes perfect sense, and the staff are free to determine what
you might find there. If you begin specifying that you want to find an alien
race after 1,000 lightyears with unique laser technology that lets you snipe
enemy ships from one sector away and so on and so on, then we are more likely to
turn the whole thing down. Give us your character's goals and wishes, not the
exact plot you wish to happen.
And, finally, follow through. Of the players who have made a complete plan for
new exploration, only a minority of those have actually gotten a crew together
and left the docking bay. This results in wasted work by everyone.
So, in brief, if your character is a well-roleplayed character with an
established curiosity for the unknown, if he or she has sensible goals, and if
he or she wishes to maximize inclusion by having a full crew instead of his or
her usual tiny circle of friends, then you may wish to ask the staff via the
SUPPORT command whether it is a good time for your character to explore and make
a new discovery. Note that, because a unique discovery often requires a great
deal of work on our part, often on a deadline, it is not something we can do
every week. A successful discovery often gets other players thinking about
heading out immediately to make discoveries for their own characters, but the
truth is, after rushing to complete something unique, we often want a month or
three of downtime and working on other projects before we do something like that
again. If a major discovery has just been made, take some time to consolidate it
-- return to it, explore around it, get to know the area. After some time has
passed, it may be time for someone else to make a new discovery.
If you have any questions about these concepts, please use the SUPPORT command
to discuss it with the staff.
