01:48 ["Sanatized Insanitarium" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, an antique bed, and a rose bush here.
You can go east and west.

04:56 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "ok, cool"

04:56 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

04:56 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

04:56 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I put it up ... I guess a couple of days ago"

04:56 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

04:56 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

04:56 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

04:56 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

04:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

04:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

04:56 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

04:56 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

04:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

04:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:57 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:57 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, and a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here, sleeping.
You can go east.

12:34 A red heart-shaped air freshener freshens the room with the scent of roses.

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.
You can go west.

17:49 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:49 Erik Yobi's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Ready?"

17:49 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:49 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

17:49 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

17:49 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:49 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

17:49 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:49 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I'll giv it to you or do you have both yet?"

17:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Heh, I want one of those. Hopefully, I can get one."

17:49 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:49 Erik Yobi's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Like it or not. Here we go."

17:49 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I'll give you mine"

17:49 Jack West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "oh boy"

17:49 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:49 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Nineteen starships have been detected in the sector."

17:49 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:49 The computer announces, "Synchronized modulated laser burst to begin in 20 seconds. Three weapon locks must be confirmed by the SML before firing can commence."

17:49 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Thanks."

17:49 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "that's too funny though"

17:49 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Pre-defined modulated laser burst program loaded. Lasers locked on coordinates 20, 18, 1. Firing will commence in 10 seconds."

17:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] You laugh.

17:49 You hear a high-pitched squeal followed by three distinct pulsing sounds as the laser turrets are fired in sync.

17:49 The computer announces, "Pre-defined target has been neutralized."

18:02 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:02 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:02 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:02 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

18:02 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

18:02 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

18:02 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

18:03 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

18:03 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:03 The computer announces, "Synchronized modulated laser burst to begin in 20 seconds. Three weapon locks must be confirmed by the SML before firing can commence."

18:03 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:03 [General Communication] Jack West transmits, "We got a spot for you reserved with the trigger pullers, my friend."

18:03 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:08 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.

22:08 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

22:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:08 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:08 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
