Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a dusky pink rattan
cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, and a small seashell pink trash can here.
You can go out.

Enter your selection:

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
{^'vM)i6Qybi#<Xd"2q8u|l>fJU`[2@%Ieoye0"!
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Money Maker" has
jumped out of the sector.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Money Maker" has
jumped out of the sector.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Money Maker" has
jumped out of the sector.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2355 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southwest
and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Asteroid King.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
sit couch
You sit up onto a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "The Huggy Pug" has
disappeared from sensor scans.
ftl 285
This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 7,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do
you wish to pay this?
[Enter `yes' or `no']
y
You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Allowing
external rift insertion. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "6 minutes."
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "On my way."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "To earth."
[General Communication] Elizabeth Beckman transmits, "Good way to raise funds,
charge toll payments for each ship in an op."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in OOC/General/All.
[Notification from Starseekers] A load of salvage has been received at League
Xenological Salvage Processing Debris-Burning Message Beacon from the two-person
medium transport "Money Maker". The organization has earned 466,390.82 credits.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Welcome
to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Surrounding space is rich with haulable asteroids
and grade 40 to 60 debris chunks. The occasional salvage op might also be held
here and repair, rearm and recharge facilities are frequently present. Your way

lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off

[Starship "Star Of Artaban"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

Dear Kim,
I have thought long and hard regarding the topics we discussed at our last
meeting and your feelings towards Lily and her org. This situation puts me in a
difficult spot and I feel very much caught in the middle. I still stand by the
principle that  we, the AEU, should stand by our own alliance's civilian pilots.
The number of active pilots has certainly diminished greatly as of late and
contentions amongst the AEU pilot Corps only serve to further tarnish our
reputation and in turn, the strength of a pilot corps. I understand that
personality clashes happen and that not everyone can get along, but
vasselization, as I understand it, is purely business and to my knowledge, there
is no way SEAS or Lily herself could threaten or take advantage of Starseekers.
This is a point I thought you made to Demarco when he opposed vasselization with
SEAs earlier. As I wish to no longer have to be caught in the middle, I have
chosen to leave Starseekers. I wish the best for you and Starseekers in future
endeavours and am willing to help whenever and wherever I can. I appreciate the
opportunity to be part of Starseekers and feel honoured that I was able to serve
in the capacity as a trustee. Take care.
Sincerely,

Dear Kim,
I have thought long and hard regarding the topics we discussed at our last
meeting and your feelings towards Lily and her org. This situation puts me in a
difficult spot and I feel very much caught in the middle. I still stand by the
principle that  we, the AEU, should stand by our own alliance's civilian pilots.
The number of active pilots has certainly diminished greatly as of late and
contentions amongst the AEU pilot Corps only serve to further tarnish our
reputation and in turn, the strength of a pilot corps. I understand that
personality clashes happen and that not everyone can get along, but
vasselization, as I understand it, is purely business and to my knowledge, there
is no way SEAS or Lily herself could threaten or take advantage of Starseekers.
This is a point I thought you made to Demarco when he opposed vasselization with
SEAs earlier. As I wish to no longer have to be caught in the middle, I have
chosen to leave Starseekers. I wish the best for you and Starseekers in future
endeavours and am willing to help whenever and wherever I can. I appreciate the
opportunity to be part of Starseekers and feel honoured that I was able to serve
in the capacity as a trustee. Take care.
Sincerely,
Shule

Dear Kim,
I have thought long and hard regarding the topics we discussed at our last
meeting and your feelings towards Lily and her org. This situation puts me in a
difficult spot and I feel very much caught in the middle. I still stand by the
principle that  we, the AEU, should stand by our own alliance's civilian pilots.
The number of active pilots has certainly diminished greatly as of late and
contentions amongst the AEU pilot Corps only serve to further tarnish our
reputation and in turn, the strength of a pilot corps. I understand that
personality clashes happen and that not everyone can get along, but
vasselization, as I understand it, is purely business and to my knowledge, there
is no way SEAS or Lily herself could threaten or take advantage of Starseekers.
This is a point I thought you made to Demarco when he opposed vasselization with
SEAs earlier. As I wish to no longer have to be caught in the middle, I have
chosen to leave Starseekers. I wish the best for you and Starseekers in future
endeavours and am willing to help whenever and wherever I can. I appreciate the
opportunity to be part of Starseekers and feel honoured that I was able to serve
in the capacity as a trustee. Take care.
Sincerely,
Shule

Star Conquest Help: Limited Support For Starships
--
Category: Game Systems
--
An alliance limits the total number of starships of certain models, particularly
gunship- and cruiser-class ships. This is because an alliance's funding is
limited, and starships incur a constant cost in energy, replacement parts, and
routine maintenance performed by spaceport technicians. These starships are
referred to as having "limited support."
Most models of starship enjoy unlimited support, and a newer player will
certainly not have to worry about support limits.
Each model of starship, if it is limited, has its own individual support limit.
For example, most alliances will support two starships of its cruiser model.
Is your starship supported?
* If you bought a ship less than a week ago, it will be in a grace period and
your alliance will support it.
* If it is one of the newest ships under the limit (for example, one of the two
newest cruisers), then your alliance will support it.
* If there are ships newer than yours being supported (for example, if your
cruiser is only the third newest), then your alliance will be supporting those
ships and will not be supporting yours.
What happens if your ship is no longer supported by your alliance? Most
importantly, flight control will deny launch clearance. This is not good. But
you can solve this problem by asking your organization to pay the support costs
for your ship. Organizations can pay these costs once per Conquest period and
allow your ship to continue flying. See HELP ORGANIZATIONS for more information.
To easily tell whether your ship is supported, you can use the SHIPINFO command.
This will show one of three status for each of your ships:
* Alliance Support: This ship is either within the one week grace period or a
newer ship under the model limit. It is currently supported by your alliance,
but it may not always be. This status will also display the support limit for
that model.
* Organization Support: This ship is supported by your organization. Nothing
will threaten its ability to fly as long as the organization pays the support
fee.
* Alliance Support Withdrawn: This ship is beyond the model limit and no longer
within the grace period. It will not be able to launch unless an organization
pays its support costs.
If you see no support status listed for one of your ships, that means that model
enjoys unlimited alliance support and you do not have to worry. Again, limited
support is mostly for larger warships and other rare or expensive models. Most
models have unlimited support.
If your character is an ace or a veteran, then you enjoy special consideration
with your alliance, and you will always have alliance support. Further, this
alliance support will not count against the alliance's model limits. You do not
need to have an organization support your limited support ships.
