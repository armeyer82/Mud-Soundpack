Attention pilots,

As of today, Event Horizon, colloquially known as simply Horizon, is actively declaring war on the private organization known as Insanity. We already have many allies, and will actively disrupt all Insanity operations from this moment forward. This has been a long time coming, and is very well deserved. The organization leaders -- Cria Blur and Fawkes Fogwell -- are well established liars, backstabbers and have pushed the envelope so far that we feel we have no choice but to bring down the hammer on this ongoing mischief. Fawkes and Cria have stolen or destroyed other people's ships, threatening them that they should join Insanity or will be continually hunted. They have used their words to strike fear into their own members, bribing people to join with false promises, and even gone as far as having serious issue with people leaving to the point where people are too scared to stand up for themselves and leave the organization. This is unacceptable.

Cria himself has lied to many pilots to gain money and sympathy. The latest incident of this occurring was during an invasion when he lost his battlecruiser. Rather than purchasing a new one, he immediately deposited money into his insurance fund and approached many people asking for credits. reliable sources report that he had more than enough money to purchase a new battlecruiser, but played people's feelings to obtain credits that he rightfully never earned. During this same invasion, his selfish tendencies were the very reason I lost my own; he landed to save himself, without coordinating correctly with other battlecruiser pilots that were present in the sector. Furthermore, Fawkes has admitted to me on multiple occasions that he invites as many members as possible into his organization so that he can collect more money from tithe. I could go on and write pages and pages describing what underhanded tactics these two have taken part in, but that would be a waste of my and your time. Suffice it to say that things have gone too far.

Insanity members: we want to help you. We understand that you may have joined out of fear, or are afraid that you will be hunted if you leave. Insanity member or not, you can approach any Horizon member to discuss this with us. As incentive, anyone who supports our endeavor will also receive the following:

* Access to private structures that we control, as well as allies private structures. Most of these structures have observation rooms that you are welcome to use.
* Protection from us. We are a group of very skilled pilots and are one-hundred percent able to help
01:06  you out of less than desirable situations, including ones with Fawkes and Cria.
* Access to Templar, the best medieval space station in the known sectors!
* Discounts on starship upgrades created with asteroid mining.
* And much more.

From here on out, all Horizon structures including our space station in sector 40 will be closed to the general public until the conflict is over. Once again, you can contact any Horizon member for more information or if you want to help with the war effort. For your convenience, these people are: Anton Navarro, Joseph Navarro, Noah Navarro, Stanton Sefdon, Jason Harkness, and Gabriel Marin.

Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!

Attention Noah Navarro,


Perhaps you are unaware, but our organization is a business enterprise and not something that one can 'declare war' on. It is the largest ever group of pilots who are devoted to most of all safety and comfort of the membership of Insanity. We apologize for the common misconceptions about the organization, and we welcome your concern, albeit rather unfounded, about the administration of the organization.

To address some of the out of context misinformation in this post, first of all, of course we would like to have as many members as possible in the organization, it is one of the primary goals and functions of Insanity to create an environment where pilots are created equal, where people can live without fear. Every single credit that has ever been earned by the tithe of our organization has been put directly back into the operations of the organization, from our homes, to helping the payouts of the lottery. Never has any of this money been used for any personal gain by myself or any other administrator, nor the owner of the organization, Cria Blur.

This post, in and of itself is hypercritical of everything that is basically being 'called out' here. We are a 100% peaceful private invite only organization with a devoted following and membership who feel not only safe, but welcome by everyone. There is no amount of force, or threat of force, that can cause someone to join something completely against there will. Can it be advantageous for someone to join a private organization for reasons of protection, safety, security and comfort? Certainly. By threatening to disrupt our 'operations', (of which there aren't any to really disrupt, as we all live our own private lives) you are being the very strongarm that you accuse me or us of being.

While there are many detractors of Insanity, we do not consider anyone as enemies of the organization. Again, our organization is not some kind of paramilitary group who wages private wars. Especially in times of great suffering from the Praelor, I don't think that now is the time for any kind of conflict between humans. Personal conflict is one thing, if you have a problem with myself or maybe Cria, that would make sense, but the inclusion of an organization in your vendetta is frankly deplorable.

As a person, I respect you Noah, and appreciate your efforts against the Praelor. I don't really understand why you are so upset all of a sudden, however I hope that you work through whatever this inner rage you are having is. I shouldn't have to remind everyone how many people you've verbally harassed, physically attacked and even tortured, often for no good reason other than apparent boredom. It doesn't particularly make sense for someone like you to call anyone out in such a way, despite your efforts against the Praelor as of late. Just because you are a 'skilled battlecruiser pilot' that doesn't give you the right to abuse people in any way.

Quite honestly I appreciate your concern for my members, but everyone is quite happy here. Are you going to offer them a spot in your organization? Are people supposed to just leave everything behind on a whim because you are offering them protection? What is going to stop you from attacking them all again as soon as a month or two goes by anyway? You call me a liar and yet I am constantly keeping my word to people in every way.

If you want to hunt people down based on what organization they choose to be in, then the bottom line is, you are no better than you are accusing me of being. If you want some kind of enemy, you won't find it here, we all have better things to do. I am sure you will call me a coward and all other sorts of nonesense, but you won't succeed in doing any harm really. Go ahead and attack people, it is what you do anyway. It isn't as if being in one organization or another is going to make you feel one way or the other about attacking anyone you decide that you want to.

I help new pilots by giving them money, weapons and other assistance. I give people comraderie and a safe place to call home. If gathering people together toward common objectives and helping others is wrong, then please, strike me down. Perhaps my personal methods appear unjust at times, but often times, things are not as they appear. If my organization were in any way based on fear, it would have crumbled a long time ago. This isn't the first time there has been aggression against this organization and it has always survived, just as it will now.

I would appreciate it Noah, with all due respect, if you would mind your own business and not get involved with the affairs of other organizations. We have five administrators who are in charge of various facets of the organization and they, along with the membership, are the only determining factors of what will happen with the organization in the future, not you, Noah, not Horizon. You are not God, you do not control me, my organization, or anything really.

Once again, thank you for your concern, but it is business as usual at Insanity, sorry you feel otherwise!

Regards,
Professor Fawkes Fogwell

fawks. and noah. and others I am just going to say this here. but you and me had an argument over something. frankly quite stupid. then when I asked to leave you said no. I was about to leave anyway when you kicked me and my wife, and two friends of mine out then demmanded 500 mill from us. which. I did eventually pay after you and cria blew up my gunship if that's not threatening and forcing then I don't know what is. I will say no more as I have said my piece.

sincerely,
Cara Reana West

Greetings, pilots,
This coming Saturday, at 13:00 GST, I would like to sponsor a game of assassins. The game will be free to play and open to anyone with a stun weapon. The basic rules of play are as follows:

1. Each player will have one--and only one--target. Player A will have Player B, Player B will have Player C, and Player C will have Player A, though the circle will be larger depending on the number of interested players. The goal of the game is to eliminate your target. If you do, you take on the target your target originally had. Thus, if Player B eliminates Player C, then Player B will have Player A, and Player A will have Player B. Play continues until there is only one player left.

2. A player is eliminated if they are heavily stunned, then dragged back to the starting location. Remember, though, that the only player you can eliminate is your current target. This cannot be stated enough. The only person you are actively trying to stun is your target, not every other player.

3. The exception to this rule is self-defence. If your pursuer comes after you, you are allowed to stun your pursuer in order to get away. You will not get credit for stunning them
01:29 , though, and you cannot eliminate them. The only way for you to eliminate your pursuer is for the two of you to be the last two people in the game, as then your pursuer would also be your target.

4. For our first run at this, droids and drones will not be permitted. I want the game to be as welcoming to new pilots as possible. If there is interest, we could certainly have a droids/drones event, however.

5. The first game will be held on Pluto.

If you are interested in playing, send me a mail or feel free to post on the board. I am also happy to answer any questions.
In these troubled times, it's important for us to keep our skills sharp. Why not have fun doing it?
All the best,
-D

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

01:30 You remove a droid remote titled "Empanda" from a black leather briefcase.

01:31 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Not much. Did some roid hauling today. Did you read the recent posts on General/General?"

01:31 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The ten-person battlecruiser "Let Justice Be Done" has launched from Acrylon.

01:31 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "nope haven't read much in quite awhile"

01:32 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Ah. Well, Horizons is had apparently delcared war on Insanity and will be hunting all of their members."

01:32 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Declared."

01:34 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Oh good then I thought the org you are in was joining in. It's not that I don't want a gang to defeat them but now we're going to see more prox and a lot more destroyed ships of innocent pilots."

01:35 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I definitely agree. At a time when there have been quite a few invasions as of late."

01:36 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Soli Deo Gloria", the eight-person gunship "Dream of The Return", the seven-person expeditioner "Packer", and the one-person cargo hauler "Flying Things" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, C

Attention pilots,

As of today, Event Horizon, colloquially known as simply Horizon, is actively declaring war on the private organization known as Insanity. We already have many allies, and will actively disrupt all Insanity operations from this moment forward. This has been a long time coming, and is very well deserved. The organization leaders -- Cria Blur and Fawkes Fogwell -- are well established liars, backstabbers and have pushed the envelope so far that we feel we have no choice but to bring down the hammer on this ongoing mischief. Fawkes and Cria have stolen or destroyed other people's ships, threatening them that they should join Insanity or will be continually hunted. They have used their words to strike fear into their own members, bribing people to join with false promises, and even gone as far as having serious issue with people leaving to the point where people are too scared to stand up for themselves and leave the organization. This is unacceptable.

Cria himself has lied to many pilots to gain money and sympathy. The latest incident of this occurring was during an invasion when he lost his battlecruiser. Rather than purchasing a new one, he immediately deposited money into his insurance fund and approached many people asking for credits. reliable sources report that he had more than enough money to purchase a new battlecruiser, but played people's feelings to obtain credits that he rightfully never earned. During this same invasion, his selfish tendencies were the very reason I lost my own; he landed to save himself, without coordinating correctly with other battlecruiser pilots that were present in the sector. Furthermore, Fawkes has admitted to me on multiple occasions that he invites as many members as possible into his organization so that he can collect more money from tithe. I could go on and write pages and pages describing what underhanded tactics these two have taken part in, but that would be a waste of my and your time. Suffice it to say that things have gone too far.

Insanity members: we want to help you. We understand that you may have joined out of fear, or are afraid that you will be hunted if you leave. Insanity member or not, you can approach any Horizon member to discuss this with us. As incentive, anyone who supports our endeavor will also receive the following:

* Access to private structures that we control, as well as allies private structures. Most of these structures have observation rooms that you are welcome to use.
* Protection from us. We are a group of very skilled pilots and are one-hundred percent able to help
01:46  you out of less than desirable situations, including ones with Fawkes and Cria.
* Access to Templar, the best medieval space station in the known sectors!
* Discounts on starship upgrades created with asteroid mining.
* And much more.

From here on out, all Horizon structures including our space station in sector 40 will be closed to the general public until the conflict is over. Once again, you can contact any Horizon member for more information or if you want to help with the war effort. For your convenience, these people are: Anton Navarro, Joseph Navarro, Noah Navarro, Stanton Sefdon, Jason Harkness, and Gabriel Marin.

Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!

01:46 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The ten-person battlecruiser "Let Justice Be Done" has left the sector.

01:48 Logged out.

01:48 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:48 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

01:48 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:50 You make a selection on a compact gold Lore computer.

01:50 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kalista" reports current location pinpointed aboard the five-person transverser "Remnants" at Hyperion.

01:52 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:52 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

01:55 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I just am not happy with coming to work these days. I had hoped to be motivated but now I just want to take off out of communications range and stay there."

01:55 A message board reader beeps quietly, indicating to you that there is a new message in General / General. It was posted by Jason Harkness with the subject "Re: Official Declaration of War Against Insanity".

Intimidation isn't even the only issue here. What self-respecting leader of an organization would say "Oh you left my org without permission? You owe me half a billion credits now."? What the hell gives these people the right to expect to be owed anything of that magnitude? A reasonable person would say that it's the leaving party's loss and move on with their life. There's also the sheer amount of subjugation going on. I've heard on multiple occasions bragging about how many people are in this organization and how much money they're raking in and how they're going to "put it to good use". Right. Because how does having a whole bunch of houses and space stations benefit the individual? It doesn't. I'm sorry, but this has been entirely too long in coming.

While I do not seek to disclose any classified information with this post, I would like to raise a point which I think has been long-neglected. Alliance specialty starships are fairly balanced in most respects, save for the lack of docking bays on ANY of the Commonwealth and Hale ships. The fact that AIE specialty ships have docking bays on two of them is somewhat logical--they are an Alliance of explorers. However, it does not strike me as logical that Hale--as more of a technologically and military-oriented Alliance--would not have a docking bay on say the Sentinel for smaller ships, particularly fighters. Likewise, it strikes me that the Commonwealth would want a docking bay on the Roborant-class starships, both to actually utilize the wasted space of the observation room and to keep on par with Hale and AIE. What I am proposing is the the hosts have a discussion regarding implementing docking bays on Robrants and Sentinels, at the absolute minimum. They don't have to be large--maybe 2 or 3 docking mass units--but it seems logical, from an IC point of view, that docking bays would be present on at least one of the Commonwealth and Hale specia
02:07 lty ships respectively.
Sincerely,
Allen Robinson

Firstly. AIE only has one ship with a docking bay. Secondly, it's really presumptuous of you to go telling the hosts "have a discussion about putting docking bays on..." when these designs have been in use, for what I assume, is a lot longer than you've even had an account here. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, it might be infinitely more practical to just develop a fourth wave of specialty technology.

This isn't the right place for this message, this is not a concern. A concern would be like a balance issue or something. What you are suggesting would be unbalancing the game, and should go under the suggestions category if anything. Roborants and Sentinels are already powerful and useful ships, many pilots use them, no need to improve upon them. 

Honestly if anything should get a DB it is surveyors, another AIE ship, as right now their primary use is that of a battery, and even a voyager can have an easier time out of locals than one. JUST SAYING.

Fourth wave of specialty ships is a cool idea, but not sure what they would be...I was thinking since Commonwealth have storage as one of their upgrades that they could get some kind of giant superfraters. Hale always gets ships that are good in a fight, maybe they could cross streams with AIE and get a combat/ools ship, and the AIE could get a ship that could do MOD missions more effectively (although I love a good tranny mod).

Just some thoughts, there are a lot of ways to go on this. Honestly AIE kind of gets the shit end of the stick on usability of ships...think about it, you see he
02:08 lios, roborants, antags and sentinels, and you certainly see plenty of trannies, but how many people are flying around surveyors?

I think that Commonwealth actually have some of the best technology, and other than basically one drive that people like to use to go out of locals faster, AIE doesn't have much to offer...so complaining about not having a docking bay is kinda funny.

JUST MY TWO CENTAVOS!

The only thing I can really say is that the surveyor used to be great for artifacting because of reasons. But then once Praelor started showing up out of local space they became obsolete because of the lack of useability. To me, that's the only specialty ship that's utterly pointless to own, aside from the battery factor out of all nine available in game.

All right, so I may have overstepped. I still think there ought to be a discussion about this or something similar. To the hosts, I meant no offense--it was a poor choice of words on my part.

This already exists elsewhere in various forms, but I have my own idea that will revolutionize it and make target tracking great again! Prepare yourselves. Gird your loins and brace yourself for something absolutely tremendous.
When a crew is fighting, both in invasions and large combat missions, it can get confusing what ship is being targeted by the pilot. Between the spam of starship movement, repairs, and pilots screaming with joy over the intercom, this information can often get lost. By the time you're looking for it, it's scrolled a whole page up on your client, and woe is you, you dont know what the pilot is staying in range of. Or, even worse, you'll just target the closest ship rather than asking for someone to repeat themselves, which more than likely isnt the ship the pilot was going for in the first place.
This said, I propose the following idea: target tracking! It's not what you think it is. You would still have to work to obtain coordinates and other pertinent information, but you would always be able to reference back to the ship that the pilot is telling people to go for. Here's how it works.
The pilot would use a command, potentia
02:11 lly SETTARGET or just TARGET, that would set a ship-wide target for gunners to focus on. Then, gunners could use the keyword "target" to reference that ship. So let's say I set Praelor Onno 147 as my target, by typing TARGET 147. Everyone else on the ship can now type SC TARGET to scan the target I've set, or FOCUS TARGET to set the focused ship to that target. Once the target had been eliminated (or left the sector), the target would be cleared and you'd be back to stage one. That's all there is to it. Players would still have to actively work to get coordinates, and would only get updates if the target was manually changed or cleared by the pilot themselves.
I think this will, if executed correctly, help gunners exponentially both new and old. Yelling what you're going after over the intercom isn't that civilized, anyway. Since you'd not automatically be receiving coordinates, this minimizes the scriptability of it as well.
Thoughts? Hatemail? Constructive criticism? Hit me.

There have been a few fundamental changes to how atmospheric salvagers work. After reconsideration, we acknowledge that this activity had minimal risks for significant gain. As such, you are now required to keep your starship in space and within one unit of the planet before launching an atmospheric salvager. This is similar to the way gas and aquatic salvagers have always worked. To return to your ship, you should move up (hit +), rather than down. To move further into the atmosphere, move down (hit -).

Crashing an atmospheric salvager will now return you to your starship's storage room, rather than the planet's surface. Launching or returning any form of salvager will also announce what's happening sector-wide to other ships that might be present. Finally, salvagers will be notified when another ship locks on the mothership while they're launched. They'll also be alerted when the mothership's status changes to purple, or if it's been fired on.

Please report any wonkiness that occurs!

Some people have expressed that the changes to atmospheric salvaging no longer make it worth it, or that the changes overshadow gas giant and aquatic salvaging and make those activities give comparatively less return on investment. This is an ongoing balancing act, and will be addressed eventually. For more information on what will be changing with scooper salvaging of all varieties, please see board post 81859.

Thanks for your understanding and patience as we rework these activities.

As a former member and admin of Insanity I have heard these allegations before, but no proof has ever been brought up that would convince me that these rumors were true. When I chose to part ways with Insanity neither Fawkes nor Cria tried to make me pay to leave. Without proof, or a way to prove that these allegations are either true or false, all we have at the end of the day are rumors. Bbut since logic has done little to stop wars in the past, let the fireworks begin.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

13:54 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

13:55 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

13:55 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:55 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has undocked from Empanda Station.

13:55 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:55 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:55 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your chair.

13:55 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:55 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

13:55 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.

13:55 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:55 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:55 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:55 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

13:55 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:55 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

13:55 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

13:55 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:57 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:57 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

13:57 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

13:57 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

13:57 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the eight-person gunship "Dream of The Return" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid the droid, Carmine the droid, Groot the droid, Chi the droid
13:57 , Michae the droid, Andreas the droid, JessiePops the droid, Andrew the droid, Arielabear the droid, Kaiti the droid, Christifer the droid, and Bethan the droid here.
You can go north, east, southeast, southwest, west, and down.

14:04 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.

15:17 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

Subject: Official Declaration of War Against Insanity
Sender: Noah Navarro

Reference: 87641   |   Votes: +16/ -3
-----------------------------------------
Attention pilots,

As of today, Event Horizon, colloquially known as simply Horizon, is actively declaring war on the private organization known as Insanity. We already have many allies, and will actively disrupt all Insanity operations from this moment forward. This has been a long time coming, and is very well deserved. The organization leaders -- Cria Blur and Fawkes Fogwell -- are well established liars, backstabbers and have pushed the envelope so far that we feel we have no choice but to bring down the hammer on this ongoing mischief. Fawkes and Cria have stolen or destroyed other people's ships, threatening them that they should join Insanity or will be continually hunted. They have used their words to strike fear into their own members, bribing people to join with false promises, and even gone as far as having serious issue with people leaving to the point where people are too scared to stand up for themselves and leave the organization. This is unacceptable.

Cria himself has lied to many pilots to gain money and sympathy. The latest incident of this occurring was during an invasion when he lost his battlecruiser. Rather than purchasing a new one, he immediately deposited money into his insurance fund and approached many people asking for credits. reliable sources report that he had more than enough money to purchase a new battlecruiser, but played people's feelings to obtain credits that he rightfully never earned. During this same invasion, his selfish tendencies were the very reason I lost my own; he landed to save himself, without coordinating correctly with other battlecruiser pilots that were present in the sector. Furthermore, Fawkes has admitted to me on multiple occasions that he invites as many members as possible into his organization so that he can collect more money from tithe. I could go on and write pages and pages describing what underhanded tactics these two have taken part in, but that would be a waste of my and your time. Suffice it to say that things have gone too far.

Insanity members: we want to help you. We understand that you may have joined out of fear, or are afraid that you will be hunted if you leave. Insanity member or not, you can approach any Horizon member to discuss this with us. As incentive, anyone who supports our endeavor will also receive the following:

* Access to private structures that we control, as well as allies private structures. Most of these structures have observation rooms that you are welcome to use.
* Protection from us. We are a group of very skilled pilots and are one-hundred percent able to help
16:13  you out of less than desirable situations, including ones with Fawkes and Cria.
* Access to Templar, the best medieval space station in the known sectors!
* Discounts on starship upgrades created with asteroid mining.
* And much more.

From here on out, all Horizon structures including our space station in sector 40 will be closed to the general public until the conflict is over. Once again, you can contact any Horizon member for more information or if you want to help with the war effort. For your convenience, these people are: Anton Navarro, Joseph Navarro, Noah Navarro, Stanton Sefdon, Jason Harkness, and Gabriel Marin.

Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!

16:21 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

16:21 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:21 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

16:21 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

16:21 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The ten-person battlecruiser "Immortal Salvation" has jumped into the sector.

16:21 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:21 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The three-person freighter "Shimmering Rose" has undocked from Empanda Station.

16:21 The ship must be in space to do that.

16:21 The computer announces, "Four starships and two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:21 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:22 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency.

19:17 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

Not that I give two tin shits about you or your moronic ways, Tiberius, but I was told directly from the horse's ass that you were a prime target for leaving without permission. So you just go on and keep thinking that you're immune from their tyrannical ways.

I believe it's nothing but a powerplay by third-raters who want to be one up. We should focus on praelor, gentlemen. NOt such pointless "wars" as you call them. OUr organisation is a place people join when they wish, no one forced them.

23:58 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
