Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and layer of gravel on the floor creates
a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the center is
guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon green
plastic plant waves around, anchored into the gravel. A large goldfish and
several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

yellow plastic laundry basket, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a long
plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a glossy pale pink ceramic felo chow
