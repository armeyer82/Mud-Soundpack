This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
01:05 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food
frosting:
    none
    with chocolate frosting
    topped with chocolate whipped cream

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

02:17 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

02:17 ["Dark Bandis" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You can go northwest.

02:17 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Hugs and kisses."

02:17 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:17 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:17 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:17 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:17 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:18 #$#soundpack_pong

02:18 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:18 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:18 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:18 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:18 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:18 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

Miriam,
I understand your frustration, anger, and heartache. I admit that I was unfair to you. However, vindictiveness is not the answer. I really thought you were above making our former relationship a public matter.
I know for a fact that you involved Cria. The same person who attacked and blew up my gunship and stole my transverser. I also know that you tracked me and that soon after that someone attempted to enter my ship. Therefore, I have no doubt that you told him where I was.
I'll make this very very simple. I have in my possession, not one, not two, but three of your ships. They are locked up and not even Cria will be able to get them for you.
If you ever wish to see them again or any of the possessions within them, you will renounce your request for Cria to attack and/or hunt me in any way or form. You will also make certain that none of his organization members do anything to attack, hunt or trap Kitty in any manner. Furthermore, if you, Cria, or any of his organization members attempt to steal ships, droids, or to stun, incapacitate, or otherwise take any violent or malicious action against me or Kitty, your ships will never be returned into your possession.
It is imperative that these terms be written down in a letter which is to be signed by you and Cria and mail to me. Then, and only then, after thorough examination and when I am satisfied that the terms are accurate and complete, will I consider returnin
02:42 g your ships to you. 
Please understand that I do not wish nor want any hostility between us and that this action was provoked by you. Revenge is not the way nor the answer and this is no way to do things, but you have forced my hand. Do so never again and this will be forgotten and forgiven. You have until the baby's original due date to comply. The letter will hold no value if received on or after that date and I will do with your ships as I please and see fit.
Tibo

14:20 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go down and out.

14:50 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Hunks, that is to say, small circular hunks of metal, are ammunition for the most powerful of stun weapons, hollow cylindrical devices, found using archaeology at higher levels."

14:50 [Chatter] Erik Yobi transmits, "Yes, that."

14:51 #$#soundpack_pong

14:51 #$#soundpack_lag 138

14:51 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "As for forcefields, those are devices that make wearing a whole spacesuit unnecessary. You just wear one device which doesn't have to be clothing, and you can just turn it off and on."

14:55 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "One, you probably ain't there yet. Two, you wouldn't be able to find hunks for a while even if you were. Level one archaeology is... Painful. Hell levels 2 through 4 are also, but at least at level 4, you start finding some of the good stuff."

14:55 [Chatter] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "I love dirt."

14:55 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "Level 1 is like pulling teeth."

14:55 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Or hair."

14:55 [Chatter] Erik Yobi transmits, "Except you retain your teeth, and your hair as well."

14:55 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "Literally yeah."

14:56 [Chatter] Erik Yobi transmits, "They're not so yucky after they've been properly fried."

14:56 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "And once you get to level 4 by the way, keep it. Get levels five six and 7, but keep your four. Four sees less deeply than 5 6 or 7, and myabe even 8. They just starts being directional."

15:03 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Actually, this is where I must help you a bit. You will benefit from a hollow. You need them to kill mutant fuzzies."

15:03 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "A regular turret will work, but not as well."

15:03 [Chatter] Erik Yobi transmits, "I always just use a regular turret, because it makes me appreciate the challenge even more."

15:06 [Chatter] Cris Smith transmits, "This sounds even more worthless most powerful weapon around and you cant even get ammo in a normal shop."

17:10 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go down and out.

17:10 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

17:10 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

17:10 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person AIE runabout "Starfish" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

17:15 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.

17:30 ["Tibo" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go south and out.

You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

17:54 You peer northeast and see...

17:54 ["Dark Bandis" Weapons Room 2]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see May Green here.
You can go southwest.

17:54 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I can double up."

17:57 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:58 #$#soundpack_pong

17:58 #$#soundpack_lag 108

17:58 There are no damaged components.

17:58 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:58 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:58 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:58 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:58 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:58 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:58 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:58 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:58 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:59 #$#soundpack_pong

17:59 #$#soundpack_lag 110

17:59 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:59 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:59 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:59 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:59 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fire And Ice, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
Meredeth Lancaster exclaims, "sounds good!"

18:36 Meredeth Lancaster strides down.

18:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

18:36 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:37 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:37 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:37 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:37 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:37 The computer announces, "Jumpgate access has been denied owing to the fact that we do not possess a mission security clearance code."

18:37 You press a large yellow button.

18:37 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

18:38 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

18:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fire And Ice. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

18:38 No such ship could be found.

18:38 Your active starship is now the two-person vanguard "Fire And Ice". This will be the default ship at most prompts when possible.

18:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

18:38 The computer announces, "This vessel's local archive of the Galactic News has been updated with new material."

18:38 The two-person vanguard "Fire And Ice" is located at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.

A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

You see an internal stun turret, a tall red captain's chair, and a tall red co-captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

23:44 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Everyone ready?"

23:44 Magan Trinity's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "yeah lets rock"

23:44 Bob Jones's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I'm good to go!!"

23:44 Justin Stroup's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "yes"

23:44 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:44 You press a large yellow button.

23:44 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

23:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:44 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

23:44 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:45 #$#soundpack_pong

23:45 #$#soundpack_lag 108

23:45 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:45 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:45 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:45 The ship is already on that status level.

23:45 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:45 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:45 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:45 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:45 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:45 The ship must be in space to do that.

23:45 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

23:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:45 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

23:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:45 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."
