Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy
pale pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather
captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a
hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a
small white trash bin, a small blue insulated cooler, a compact red
refrigerator, a blue plastic food storage container, a small red insulated
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, Purr
the humanoid service robot, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a
white shipsuit with gold trim around the collar and cuffs here.

It's not always about where you're going.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 225.0, 0.0.
You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?
Lily says, "I'm making the circle."

You say, "Ok."

It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

"Hmmm," you say.

You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem extremely loud. The signal strength meter reads: 94%.
"Or increase it," says Lily, "either way I am jus trying to determine which way
we should fly this thing."
'right
You say, "Right."
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
"I'm so frustrated because I thought I was going in the right direction," Lily
says. "The signal showed as 'overwhelmingly loud' which means we were likely
getting close to 96 but it went went back to extremely lound and then decreased
to 94 at Extremely loud."
Lily says, "Loud that is."
'Awww.
You say, "Awww."
Lily says, "I may try comething pretty drastic like head south or north until we
get out of known space and then come back in and see how the signal is."
Lily says in a New Earth accent, "Something that is wow."

"Ok," you say.
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I've been keyboarding a lot today, sorry."

A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils

get back to local space so I have some sort of baseline."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of soft electric blue boots.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster.
Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise
Vineyards Pinot Grigio in her right hand.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy

coffee table with a glass top, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a
hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a wall-sized bubbling neon

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
-------------------------------------
Category: Game Systems
-------------------------------------
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.
Civilian Liaisons
You cannot determine the current office holders while out of communications
range.
In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
'134 is the artifact site. 135 is to come home.
"134 is the artifact site," you say. "135 is to come home."
Lily nods.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

rift heading
Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).
Invalid heading.

rift heading
Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).
Invalid heading.

[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Ah okay, thanks."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
aR2:RPxl0>?KiF#2|nS5~M4(2'MN[xJXVn'hvj/9
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2240 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northeast
