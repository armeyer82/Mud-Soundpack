11:10 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a white wicker wardrobe, a fuzzy suitcase, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a pink suitcase, and a pair of gray sneakers with red laces here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.
You can go south.

You can go south, down, and out.

11:10 You remove a red cotton polo with thin white stripes from a transparent seashell white glass low table.

11:10 You slip a red cotton polo with thin white stripes over your head where it rests comfortably on your torso.

11:10 You sit down on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt.

11:10 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

11:10 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

12:43 You will no longer be able to use non-numeric manual navigation commands.

12:43 --------------------------------------------------

12:43 Alternative Manual Navigation
--------------------------------------------------
The alternative manual navigation option allows you to use WASD (and friends) to navigate your starship rather than using the numeric keyboard (or number row). This is beneficial to laptop users or those who are more familiar with WASD-style games. The following commands are available:

W: Navigates north. (8)
A: Navigates west. (4)
S: Navigates south. (2)
D: Navigates east. (6)
Q: Navigates northwest. (7)
E: Navigates northeast. (9)
Z: Navigates southwest. (1)
X (or C): Navigates southeast. (3)
R: Navigates up. (+)
F: Navigates down. (-)
V: Maintain current position. (5)

You may notice that some of these options conflict with existing commands. For this reason, the use of alternative manual navigation commands has been made an option that can be enabled or disabled. To make use of them, type SHIP-OPTIONS and choose the option to enable the alternatives. You can still type out the full command name to access it with the option enabled. The list below demonstrates how to enable the option and also access the existing commands:

W: West
A: Act
S: South
D: Down
E: East
R: Raven

You can also disable the option at any time to resume using the shortcut keys. To quickly toggle it on or off, use the ALTNAV command.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-toole

16:29 Starship Power Systems
--------------------------------------------------
When you type SYSTEMS in the engineering room of a starship, you will be presented with the following options:

* Main Power - When disabled, your starship will have no power. Typing POWER in the control room will not work until main power is restored.

* Subwarp Drive - When disabled, the subwarp drive will not be utilized by NAVI or GATE and cannot be manually activated.

* Slip Drive - When disabled, the slip drive will not be utilized by NAVI or GATE and cannot be manually activated.

* Docking Bay Door - If your starship is equipped with a docking bay, no other starship can enter or exit your ship's docking bay when this is disabled. They can still dock to the docking ring of your ship.

* Holographic Avatar - If available, this will disable the usage of a holographic avatar.

* Salvage Line Launchers - When disabled, your ship will be unable to launch salvage lines, making salvaging impossible.

* Solar Panels - When disabled, the solar panels will not automatically deploy when the ship gets in range of a star.

* Laser Reflectors - The reflectors will not automatically reorient to reflect laser fire when disabled.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too
