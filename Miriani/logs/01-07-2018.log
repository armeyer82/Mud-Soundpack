["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and an internal stun turret here.

02:26 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and an internal stun turret here.

02:26 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit the droid, Rar the droid, Acer the droid, Kaitlyn the droid, Nala the droid, Zia the droid, Hector the droid, Morison the droid, Kangaroo the droid, Hadron the droid, and Holly the droid here.

02:34 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

11:13 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

You see nothing special. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Docking Bay.
You see a silver king-sized pillow-top bed with an elegantly curving headboard, a long buffet table covered with a sapphire blue velvet tablecloth, and a tall clay sculpture of a willow tree here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a silver king-sized pillow-top bed with an elegantly curving headboard) here.
You can go west.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, and an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, three glossy pink security drones, a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top, Breice West, James West, a cream-colored Amalthean wolfhound puppy, and an arctic wolf here.

She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This slender woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 8 inches tall with an ample bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a light golden tan complexion. Her silky waist-length, honey blonde hair is fashioned in to regal curls dusted with gold glitter and held back with an antique platinum tiara adorned with numerous precious gems. She has expressive celestial blue eyes with an elegant button nose above a set of full, pouty lips which part to reveal sparkling white, perfectly straight teeth. Her abdomen is very large and rounded, appearing to have shifted lower on her frame. She has a sapphire blue drawing of a winged heart on her forehead and a hot pink drawing of a pair of angel wings with the words "simply angelic" written above them on her ears. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a bright energy field.
She has a tattoo of a female angel with her white feathered wings spread out in flight on her right shoulder, a tattoo of a male angel with his midnight black feathered wings spread in an arc on her left shoulder, a tattoo of a red heart on her left thigh, a tattoo of a pink heart with a blood-tipped arrow going through it on her right thigh, a tattoo of an angel with rays of light emanating from it on her upper back, a tattoo of a gold phoenix being born out of flames on her lower back, and a tattoo of a sapphire blue spaceship on her torso.
She has a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her left earlobe and a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with sparkly snow white eyeshadow. She is wearing sparkly snow white lip dye on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted dusky gold with silver and gold celtic knots and adorned with intertwining hearts that flow from nail to nail and the nails on her right hand are painted dusky gold with silver and gold celtic knots and adorned with intertwining hearts that flow from nail to nail.
She is wearing a holographic tube dress comprised of writhing black and red snakes which shift and part to reveal glimpses of bare skin.  She is wearing an eye-catching sapphire blue rose gold belly chain adorned with tiny dangling white glass lilies around her waist. She is also wearing a high-capacity sparkly Lore computer, a spacious cerulean blue rabbit fur diaper bag with a dangling silver angel charm on the zipper, a small well-crafted harp hanging from a golden chain, a moonstone studded gold digital wristwatch with an angel-shaped liquid crystal face, a sky blue reinforced alligator skin leather tote bag with a heraldic cross design stamped on the front and a clasp shaped like a crown, a yellow beaded velvet garment bag with priceless gems lining the openings, an antique white gold engagement ring set with a radiant bloodstone,
21:56  an intricately braided white gold chain with an elegant baby-shaped platinum locket encrusted with sapphires suspended from it, a gold suede purse with beaded black roses on it, a dainty tri-colored gold friendship ring featuring a princess-cut red 4 karat star ruby accented by white diamonds, a gold padded fleece cradle sling, a delicate white gold diamond-studded wedding ring, and a blue spacesuit jet.

22:56 --------------------------------------------------
Assault
--------------------------------------------------
To start a game, you set the deck of cards on the ground, and type BEGIN. After the first player has shuffled the cards,
a second player may then type BEGIN to join the game.
Once there are two players, each player must type DRAW to draw their twenty playing cards. Immediately after drawing, you
will need to choose five cards to defend your space station. It is wise to put one good defense card for each of the four
attacks: Melee, Ranged, Psionic, and Siege. A word of caution however, if you put all of your best cards in your space
station, you won't have very good attacks to defend your hand. Once both players have drawn their cards, a random roll
will determine who attacks first. That person will then type PLAY to choose a card to attack with.
-- ATTACKING
When it is your turn to attack, you will PLAY a card to attack your opponent with. You should choose a card that has a
high attack rate, as it will give you a better chance of winning the attack. Your actual attack will be a random number
from 0 to the attack rate of the card. Once you attack a player, they will get a chance to defend against the attack.
-- DEFENDING
Once someone has attacked you, you must PLAY a card to defend against the attack. The type of attack will be shown to
you so you will know whether it is melee, ranged, psionic, or a siege attack, and will also know the maximum the atta
22:56 ck
will be. You want to try and defend with a card that has a higher defense than the attack, but if you do not have a card
with a higher defense, it is best to choose whichever card has the highest defense for that attack, as both the attack
and defense will be a random dice roll of the numbers.
-- ATTACKING OUTCOME
Once both players have selected their cards, the dice will roll numbers for the attack and defense, and the highest of
the numbers is decided to be the winner of that round. If the attack is successful, the card that was used to defend is
eliminated from the other player's hand, and the attacker may go again. If the attack is not successful, then the attacker's
turn is over, and the other player gets to choose a card to attack with.
Play continues like this until all 15 cards in either player's hand are eliminated.
-- SPACE STATION
Once all of the cards in one of the player's hands have been thrown out, the other player will start to attack that
person's space station. This is done using the same format as regular fighting, with the player choosing a card to
attack with, and the other player trying to defend. If an attack is successful, the card that was used to defend is
once again eliminated. If the attack is not successful then, once again, the defender gets a chance to attack.
-- SPACE STATION OUTCOME
Should a space station not lose any cards, and destroy the other players cards, then the gam
22:56 e is considered a tie since
space stations cannot attack each other. However, should the space station lose cards, but still manage to destroy the
cards in the other player's hand, the other player will be declared the winner since their space station did not sustain
damage like the other did. And the final outcome, is if a player destroys all five cards in a space station while still
having cards in their hand, they are declared the winner.

23:01 ROOC
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  ROOC [<message> | ON | OFF | WHO]
Description:
  ROOC is the room OOC command. It functions in much the same way as the SAY command, with the notable exception being that it is entirely out of character. It should never be used to communicate in character information. If you supply the WHO argument, the command will tell you all of the people in the room who have enabled the ROOC command and will hear what you say. Using a : (colon) in front of your message will cause it to be emoted. Please use out of character emotes on this channel rather than enacting them in character to prevent confusion.
Examples:
  >ROOC My fish has been eating nonstop. Now it's dead. :(
Output: [ You shatter immersion and say, "My fish has been eating nonstop. Now it's dead. :(" ]
  >ROOC :raises a mighty trout above his head, bringing it down with a resounding smack on Mitchell's upturned face.
Output: [ Victor shatters immersion and raises a mighty trout above his head, bringing it down with a resounding smack on Mitchell's upturned face. ]
  >ROOC OFF
Output: You disable OOC room communication.
  >ROOC ON
Output: You enable OOC room communication.
