The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

02:08 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:09 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub] (indoors)
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

02:26 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

02:26 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:26 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

02:27 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:27 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:27 The ship is already moving.

02:27 [AIE | Channel 1] Matt Valentino transmits in a low whisper, "Just living the life of a hermit."

02:27 #$#soundpack social | whisper | male

02:27 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:27 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:27 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:27 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:27 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:27 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:27 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

02:27 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:27 Select a ship:

02:27 [1] the five-person transverser "Going The Distance"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:27 The five-person transverser "Going The Distance" has left the sector.

02:27 Invalid selection.

02:27 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:27 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:27 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:27 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:27 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

02:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

02:27 You peer out and see...

02:27 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

13:22 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

13:22 [General Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "I'd be up for mods, but I don't think we can get enough people."

13:57 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the eight-person gunship "From Out of The Shadows", the ten-person battlecruiser "Ooey Gooey Butter Cake You're So Addictive", the five-person transverser "Iridescence", the three-person antagonizer "Primordial Storm", and the eight-person gunship "Blue Star" landed here.

15:10 You remove a droid remote titled "rolukssica" from a black leather briefcase.

15:10 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The ten-person battlecruiser "Subtle Resilience" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

15:10 You gently slide a droid remote titled "rolukssica" into a slot on the side of a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. With a soft click, the remote snaps into place and the screen is filled with a live broadcast of Observation Lounge.

15:10 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:10 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

15:10 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

15:10 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:10 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The ten-person battlecruiser "Subtle Resilience" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

15:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:10 You're already sitting down.

15:10 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:10 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:10 The ship is already moving.

15:10 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:10 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:10 [General Communication] Moiraine Soto transmits, "2 spots."

15:11 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

15:11 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:11 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

15:11 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:11 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:11 The starship is already moving.

15:11 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

15:11 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

15:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

15:11 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

15:11 [General Communication] Moiraine Soto transmits, "Alpha."

15:11 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:11 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:16 [General Communication] Moiraine Soto transmits, "Last call, 2 spots, mods."

15:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:16 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:16 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:16 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:16 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:17 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:17 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:17 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

15:17 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:17 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:17 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:17 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:17 You peer northwest and see...

15:17 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, and a compact light blue cooler on wheels here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:17 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:17 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:27 You peer northwest and see...

15:27 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, and a compact light blue cooler on wheels here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

15:43 ["Samma" Weapons Room 4] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a small white marble side table with twisting iron flower vines encircling the tabletop, a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a turquoise plastic cooler on wheels, and a silver trash bin here.

16:18 You peer southeast and see...

16:18 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact light blue cooler on wheels, a mutated fuzzy corpse, a glowing blue medical drone, a glowing blue security drone, Ia the droid, and Eo the droid here.
You see Erik Yobi, Anny Rain, and Moiraine Soto here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

16:19 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:24 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

16:24 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

16:24 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

16:25 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:25 Erik Yobi's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "On a toast."

16:25 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:25 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:25 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:25 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:25 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:25 You peer southeast and see...

16:25 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, and a compact light blue cooler on wheels here.
You see Amy Draksen (sitting on a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair) and Moiraine Soto here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

16:25 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:25 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:25 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

16:25 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:25 Erik Yobi's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Yellow is a thing."

16:25 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:26 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:26 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:26 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:26 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:26 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:35 You ask Lena Mylan if she wishes to establish a secure communications link with you. Note that this link can be used from a distance once it is established.

16:35 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:35 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:35 Your communicator flashes a series of cryptic looking numbers before confirming the secure link with Lena Mylan.

16:35 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:36 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:36 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

16:36 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:36 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:36 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I didn't gu that well this mission."

16:36 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Gun that is."

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the eight-person gunship "From Out of The Shadows", the ten-person battlecruiser "Ooey Gooey Butter Cake You're So Addictive", the five-person transverser "Iridescence", the three-person antagonizer "Primordial Storm", the eight-person gunship "Blue Star", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 9948", and the eight-person gunship "Unnatural Disaster" landed here.

17:36 A red archaeological artifact storage container

17:37 It has one of a mostly intact human jawbone with several missing teeth, one of a mostly intact wooden sledgehammer handle, one of a stained bit of cloth, and one of a human jawbone with several missing teeth stored in it.

17:37 You count 4 items in a red archaeological artifact storage container.

17:37 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:37 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

17:37 Enter a destination:

17:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:37 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

17:37 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

17:37 The eight-person gunship "Unnatural Disaster" has launched from Acrylon.

17:37 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:37 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:37 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:37 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

17:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:37 Those coordinates are currently occupied.

17:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 7, 6."

17:37 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:38 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:38 Sector 1: Satus (Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists)
Galactic Coordinates: (-603080, 1, 420)

Planets: (4, 10, 8), (14, 9, 3), and (11, 7, 5)

Satellites: (18, 7, 20)
Jumpgates: (19, 12, 7)

Current Coordinates: (8, 18, 5)

17:38 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:38 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

17:38 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

17:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

17:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

17:38 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

17:38 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

17:38 You must stand up first.

17:38 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

17:38 You stand up.

17:38 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Beginning cycling."

17:38 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard exiting the airlock.

17:38 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

17:38 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Cycling complete."

Archaeology
--------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Archaeology, like relics, is not complete. This help file will progress as the code and site generation progresses, so think of this as something like a progress report. The more you see filled the closer it is to completion. Also note that things may change since the writing of this file. If they aren't fixed when archaeology is released, be sure to let us know.

Archaeology is the process of digging up potentially interesting things from beneath the surface of wild planets or moons. There are many archaeology sites scattered throughout the galaxy, some of which contain artifacts that may be more valuable than even the alien artifacts found floating in space. Part of the good archaeologist's life is discovering new and exciting sites and artifacts.

  Requirements
* Site Scanner
* Digging tools
* Archaeology Storage Container
* Dig site
* A decent understanding of coordinate-based movement.

  Getting Started
The first thing you'll want to do is locate an archaeology site. Most beginners will want to visit sector 1 or sector 40 and begin there. Other sites are spread throughout known space while others can be found in uncharted space, oftentimes the last remnants of an alien race. Finding more advanced sites is beyond the scope of this help file.

Once you've entered an archaeology site, you'll want to begin scanning. To accomplish this, yo
19:53 u merely type USE SCANNER (assuming scanner matches to your archaeology scanner. Type MATCH SCANNER to see if this is the case. If not, you may have to use a different name, such as USE SITE or USE OTHER SCANNER). The scanner will look around and, depending on the strength and how advanced it is, will report either a vague direction or tell you if you are getting closer to something potentially valuable. As a beginner, you will probably get a message such as "A site scanner indicates a good possibility that something valuable is nearby." From there you simply walk around using the scanner until it reports that you are standing above something valuable.

  Digging
Now that you're standing above something, it's time to get out your shovel. An important thing to note here is that it's entirely possible to damage the artifact that you are attempting to dig up. If something is located 6 feet beneath the ground, it's probably safe to dig carelessly. This is accomplished by typing USE SHOVEL (assuming you're digging with a shovel). It's recommended to use your scanner periodically to check the depth of the artifact. Once you hit half a foot, it's probably not the safest idea to continue using a shovel. A lighter tool would be best until the object is just below the surface, at which time you'll want to switch to a brush. If all goes well, you'll have an intact object. If it's damaged, though, keep it. Researchers will still pay 
19:53 for damaged items.

  Researching
Once you have a storage container full of artifacts, you'll want to visit your local research center. Once there, you simply type RESEARCH ARCHAEOLOGY CONTAINER to receive your reward.

  Crafting

  Skills
Archaeology requires some degree of skill to perform. Those without the skill necessary will find themselves breaking items more often and misjudging distances while digging. The more you dig and the more artifacts you collect, the better you'll become and the less you'll break. This is why it's unwise to accept artifacts from friends just for the archaeology points.

  Discovering Structures

  Utilizing Intact Alien Technology

  Help, I'm lost!
One of the things you should know before jumping into archaeology is that some of the dig sites may be quite large, and you may find yourself facing the fact that you're lost. Not to worry, there are a few ways out. The first and most obvious is to type MAP to see where you are. Maps in dynamic rooms are not always the best, though, so the preferred way to get unstuck is to take note of the coordinates of the entrance to the site and get back to them. Once you have the coordinates to the entrance, type COORDS to see your current coordinates. From there, you just walk around until your COORDS match those of the entrance. You should never have to assist because you're lost. In fact, the majority of archaeology sites will have an entrance at coordinates 1, 1 to make getting lost a thing of the past.

  Scanners
For a list of scanner points, type POINTS in the archaeology store. Please note that, unless otherwise specified, the points are in ARCHAEOLOGY POINTS, not regular license points.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

21:06 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

21:06 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "The Cat's Meow", the six-person sentinel "Nightingale", the ten-person battlecruiser "Tribulations", and the one-person Commonwealth runabout "Potatoe Mash With Hotsauce" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Kitty the droid here.

21:15 Allon Martellato walks in from the north.

21:15 You say, "Yeah, some upgrades."

21:15 Ray Ridgeway exclaims, "oh damn! we got reppy upgardes!"

21:15 Allon Martellato examines a display containing the starship's status report.

You can go northwest.

21:15 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:15 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok, here we go"

21:15 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:15 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:15 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:15 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:15 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:15 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I think either allon or tibo should be in wr1"

21:15 Allon Martellato's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I got wr1"

21:16 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok"

21:16 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:16 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

21:16 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:16 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:16 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:16 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

21:16 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:16 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:16 [Force] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Well, at least Cria's not on the ship."

21:16 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "are you going to supbwarp?"

21:16 #$#soundpack environment starship space | powered | safe | light | indoors

21:16 ["Dark Bandis" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go northwest.

21:16 Allon Martellato's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "we in a dark bandis muhthafucka"

21:16 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:16 Current coordinates: 9, 7, 11

21:16 #$#soundpack social | laugh | male

21:16 Kenny Marley laughs over the intercom.

21:16 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:16 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:17 Current coordinates: 3, 3, 3

21:17 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

21:27 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

21:27 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

21:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

21:28 You peer northwest and see...

21:28 ["Dark Bandis" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see Michael Calaway, Kenny Marley, Allon Martellato, and Ray Ridgeway here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

21:32 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:32 Kenny Marley says, "any more"

21:32 Kenny Marley says, "that shit takes too long"

21:32 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:32 You laugh.

21:32 #$#soundpack social | laugh | male

21:32 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:32 Kenny Marley says, "uh"

21:32 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:32 Kenny Marley says, "what the fuck"

21:32 Allon Martellato says, "It does, but it's an adrenaline boost"

21:32 Kenny Marley presses a series of buttons on a sensor control board.

21:32 You say, "Time to party. I guess."

21:32 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:32 Ray Ridgeway laughs.

21:32 #$#soundpack social | laugh | male

21:32 Ray Ridgeway asks, "oh yeah, gotta burn that slip, soon as we launch, didn't ya know?"

21:32 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:33 Kenny Marley walks northeast.

21:33 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

21:33 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
#$#soundpack environment starship space | powered | safe | light | indoors
["Dark Bandis" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
You can go northwest.

21:33 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:33 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:33 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:33 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:33 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:33 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:33 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
You see Michael Calaway, Kenny Marley, and Allon Martellato here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

21:43 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

22:28 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

22:28 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:28 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

22:28 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:28 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:28 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:28 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:29 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

22:29 The ship is already moving.

22:29 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:29 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:29 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:29 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:29 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

22:29 The ship must be in space to do that.

22:29 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:29 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:29 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 7, 6."

22:29 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:29 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:29 The starship is already moving.

22:29 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:29 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:29 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:29 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:29 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

22:30 You must stand up first.

22:30 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:30 You stand up.

22:30 The internal environment does not match the external environment.

22:30 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

22:30 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Beginning cycling."

22:30 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard exiting the airlock.

22:30 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

22:30 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Cycling complete."

22:31 You stride out of the ship.

23:31 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

23:31 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:31 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
[General Communication] Allon Martellato transmits, "Shut up and gun, Jacky."

23:31 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:31 [General Communication] Kenny Marley transmits, "Oh, well jack, I guess you won't be able to come."

23:31 I don't understand that.

23:31 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:31 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:31 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:31 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:31 The ship is already moving.

23:31 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:31 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:31 [General Communication] Kenny Marley transmits, "1 spot mods folks."

23:31 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:31 [General Communication] Kenny Marley transmits, "These will be sexy mods."

23:31 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:31 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:31 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:31 [General Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "I can not fathom why you are so rude to me, sir allon, but I will find out."

23:31 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:31 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:31 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:32 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

23:32 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:32 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

23:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:32 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

23:32 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:32 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

23:32 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

23:32 [General Communication] Allon Martellato transmits, "I am rude to all engs. I do not discriminate."

23:32 [Force] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "I only have time for a couple though."

23:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:32 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

23:32 [Force] Kenny Marley transmits, "Yeah."

23:32 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:32 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.
[General Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "That's comforting."

23:32 [Force] Kenny Marley transmits, "But I still need a gunner."

23:32 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person Commonwealth runabout "Potatoe Mash With Hotsauce" has launched from Rolukssica.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.

["Palace of Shadow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.

23:47 You peer out and see...

23:47 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
