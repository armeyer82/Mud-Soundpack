01:03:46 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:03:47 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:03:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:03:48 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

01:03:49 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:03:52 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

01:03:56 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:03:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:23:08 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

Obviously the ones that come from folks saying things on comms are random but what about the others?

01:27:49 [MTTS] Ulias: I've noticed at least a few over the years that were modeled after real-world events.

01:28:12 [MTTS] usfolks: And sometimes they happen before the real world events. Which is...creepy, to say the least.

01:31:04 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:31:08 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:31:27 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh my what is going on now!"

01:31:34 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

01:31:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:31:47  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:31:47 You are carrying Prissy the big violet long-haired felo in your right hand.

01:32:20 [MTTS] Ulias: I wouldn't necessarily ask for this, because I know you guys work hard already, but the headlines are one of my favorite things, I would love it if there was at least like two a day.

01:32:27 [MTTS] Ulias: I do realize that's actually a lot ot ask though.

01:32:54 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:33:16 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:33:21 [MTTS] Ulias: One of the big things to me that makes the SC world feel alive.

01:33:44 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:33:46 [MTTS] Squidmind: Headlines come from different things. Player actions, yes, of course. We'd like to do more positive headlines in that respect, but positive proactive things tend to be rare and the negative naturally weighs more heavily in the human brain anyway. Some are spoofing current events. And some are made to move plotlines forward in a sort of background manner. Sometimes we post them instantly, but we can also queue them for any future time.

01:35:04 [MTTS] Ulias: There being less poitive ones kinda makes sense too though. In the real world the good things are often ignored by the news.

01:35:10 [MTTS] Ulias: Positive.

01:35:45 Lily Kaise gives you a letter.

01:35:54 Lily Kaise says, "This is the letter that Nicolette wrote."

01:36:01 --

01:36:02 Lily,

This isn't widely-known yet, but Eve and I are planning on putting the out-of-comms asteroid processor at 288 back up sometime in the next couple of days, given the fact that most people seem to finally be home for a while to use it. And since you were on it before, and have also been willing to consistently keep me on the one at 285, I wanted to return the favor. If you can stick a reactor, or else a basic top or sheathing, on the ship corresponding to the key here in the package, I'll see to it that you guys are there. My only request is that this be from your org directly, not a Starseekers part, as due to Kim's present stance on 777 and being unwilling to provide inserters for it, I'm currently not inclined to include them. The reactor would be preferred, but if you'd rather not spring for that much, either of the other two parts will be fine, just try to have whichever of them there within the next day or so if at all possible.

Thanks.

01:37:26 You say, "They're selfishness is catching up to them."

01:37:54 Lily Kaise says, "If Kim complains to you or tries to probe for information, just tell her to contact Nicolette as this came to me out of nowhere. I had no idea Nicolette was even going to put up the Out of Comms Asteroid Processor."

02:18:48 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand.

02:18:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:14:16 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:22:27 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

03:22:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:25:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:25:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:25:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:25:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:25:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:26:02 The ship is already moving.

03:26:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:26:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Hyperion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:26:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:26:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

03:26:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:26:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:26:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:26:14 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:26:21 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Hyperion.

03:26:22 Via general sector communication, Hyperion transmits, "Hello there, Starlight Express! Welcome to home space!"

03:26:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:26:33 The ship's current engine speed is 6857 km/s.

03:26:33 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 10.5 seconds.

03:26:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:26:47 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:26:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

03:26:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:26:54 Tamra Swenson does not seem to have an active communicator.

03:27:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:27:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:27:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:45:44 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Engineering Room]

03:45:44 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.

03:46:31 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else.

03:46:49 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Living Quarters One]

03:46:49 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.

03:47:38 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass Road]

03:47:38 Gentle winds blow the high grasses back and forth, occasionally strongly enough to push it into your path. The road is in obvious bad repair, but you don't pay it much mind, keeping your eyes on the horizon. Faint sounds of animal life can be heard over the wind. On the west side of the road the grass has been trampled, and you can see a faint trail leading from here through the grassy countryside. In addition, a bright red and white sign on the other side of the road points the way down a clear path to the Felo Sanctuary to the east.

03:47:59 You put down an old frisky hefty light red felo.

03:48:00 An old frisky hefty light red felo touches all six feet to the soft grass. It pauses, looks around briefly, then dashes off through the small door to the sanctuary.

03:48:01 A tiny bell on the donation box rings, and a small red light next to the word "Donations" blinks slowly.

03:48:03 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

03:48:11 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

03:48:11 You see Mekensie the humanoid service robot and a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go south and out.

03:48:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:48:12 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:48:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:48:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:48:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:48:25 You say, "Mekensie contents."

03:48:26 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Caretaking task has been canceled."

03:48:27 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "I am currently holding a container of fish food, a hull brush, a tube of Rust-B-Gone, a tube of weapon grease, a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow", a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow", a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow", and a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow"."

03:48:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:48:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:48:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:48:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:48:38 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:48:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:48:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:48:41 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:48:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:48:42 You say, "Mekensie caretake."

03:48:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:48:43 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."
Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "I shall watch over the living beings on this ship as if they were my own."

03:48:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:48:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:48:46 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:48:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:49:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:49:06 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:49:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:49:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:49:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:49:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:49:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

Subject: Asteroid Processor Gamma 288
Author: Nicolette Lawrence
Posted: 01:57 29 June 2317 GST

A few people have been asking about this lately, so after several months of not being there, due to various rift trips keeping a lot of people away from home and other factors, I have put the out-of-comms asteroid processor back in place, in its usual location, east of the radio bubble. There are a few caveats, however.

First, you will need the communications range safety override upgrade on your asteroid hauler to be able to make effective use of the processor. Second, the ship will also need a rift drive, as there is no inserter to or from it. Also, please note that there is no station with autonav out there, so be mindful of that and ready to land once your ship enters the sector, or risk possible problems. And finally, there is a 7.5 million EAOS credit toll for the trip back home. All of these factors have been the case for quite some time, I'm just going over them here for the benefit of newer pilots, and as a refresher course for everyone else, since it's been a while.

To get to Asteroid Processor Gamma 288, simply jump to 287 from The Belt of Orion, and then to 288 from there. You might want to trim back on the rift drive just a bit for the first few seconds of the trip out, to decrease the chances of being inadvertently pulled out into the radio bubble, although t
04:03:37 he chances of this happening seem to vary somewhat, and there doesn't appear to be any accurate way of predicting it in any case.

Happy hauling!

04:05:16 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

04:06:16 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:06:17 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:06:21 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:06:24 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:06:26 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:06:35 You say to Lily Kaise, "Hi beautiful."

04:06:51 Lily Kaise says, "Oh well we're not on the toll staiton which certainly would have helped the costs a bit but glad we're at least on the asteroid processor."

04:06:57 You nod.

04:07:00 You say, "Ah, ok."

04:07:19 Lily Kaise says, "But we have the most expensive part other than the asteroid processor itself."

04:07:26 You nod.

04:08:00 Lily Kaise says, "Ah well I probably should have put on a battery. Will next time and oh yeah I didn't give her any other parts so my bad oops."

04:08:06 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:08:42 Lily Kaise says, "Will be better prepaired but was about half asleep when I went over there."

04:08:48 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:08:49 You say, "It's ok."

04:08:53 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:24:43 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Elissa, I'm going to kick it in the pub here and munch on a cookie while we wait."

04:24:52 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "We're back."

04:25:59 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Hey Jacob? Can you come to the battlesuit place?"

04:26:49 You beam at Lily Kaise.

04:26:55 Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:28:45 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:28:47 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well might as well make it a gropu thing. Come to the battlesuit store."

04:28:52 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales laughs.

04:28:56 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Okay fine."

04:28:56 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Group thing... I mean."

04:29:08 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Tesla?"

04:29:18 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Um, if its an orgy. I wan no part of it."

04:29:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:29:25 You chuckle.

04:29:39 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Falser words were never sp...wait shutting up."

04:29:43 [General Communication] Bryan Stout whistles.

04:30:00 Lily Kaise says, "I'm surprised as she's never hesitated to sleep around with any man who would pay attention to her."

04:30:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:30:14 You say, "Yeah."

04:30:17 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

04:30:31 You say, "Sounds like something she'd go for."

04:31:42 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Are sonics better than miniguns?"

04:34:24 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Better than what?"

04:34:33 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Never mind, figured it out."

04:34:42 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Drugs."

04:34:44 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What suit are you setting up?"

04:34:50 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Rental."

04:34:53 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "No wait, that was something else."

04:35:06 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:35:06 [General Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:35:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Rental 1?"

04:35:10 You laugh.

04:35:14 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Yeah.."

04:35:14 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:35:14 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nom drugs!"

04:35:23 You laugh.

04:35:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ah chains and reps then."

04:35:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:35:31 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Ok."

04:35:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:35:35 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Try my roaches, they have no side affects."

04:35:35 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "That's what I thought."

04:35:50 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Can add the sonics when you go into a tier 2."

04:35:58 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Ok, sounds good!"

04:36:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh sure had some fun with certain substances found in our medical practice back there. Sorry I can't deny a little experimentation!"

04:36:14 Lily Kaise giggles.

04:36:20 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:36:23 You chuckle.

04:36:26 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:36:30 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:36:50 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Seriously I thought we'd have better access to drugs as pilots!"

04:36:55 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wantz, Keegan."

04:37:04 Lily Kaise says, "We don't lack in availability of alcohol."

04:37:06 You say, "Yeah, well. Guess our government doesn't want us to."

04:37:07 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:37:09 You laugh.

04:37:45 You say, "I get all frisky and cuddly when I'm drunk."

04:37:49 You chuckle.

04:38:00 Lily Kaise says, "I certainly wouldn't want to walk around bombed all the time but hey it's fun ever now and then."

04:38:01 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Jamhead."

04:38:10 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:38:11 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You are an anomaly."

04:38:15 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:38:17 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales snickers.

04:38:25 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Aren't we both?"

04:38:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."

04:38:34 Lily Kaise says, "I also wouldn't want to fly while under the influence either."

04:38:39 You say, "Yeah."

04:38:43 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Awe, listen to the two lovebirds."

04:38:44 You say, "Not a good idea."

04:38:56 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's what makes your relationship so special."

04:38:56 Lily Kaise nods.

04:38:59 You say, "Then you'll do things like try to jump to Nuevo Loredo."

04:39:01 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales giggles.

04:39:03 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Right?"

04:39:04 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We have both been temporarily abandoned by our females. We must find comfort with one another."

04:39:15 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Oh goodness."

04:39:16 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I don blame you."

04:39:23 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

04:39:24 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I could have gone a few lifetimes without hearing that."

04:39:33 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Same!"

04:39:43 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Please do not discount our love."

04:39:44 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:39:51 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:40:19 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I just made her dinner last night, but yes, our love stretches beyond the stars and well into Andromeda."

04:40:26 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.

04:40:34 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I haven't seen her on comms in ages and decades."

04:40:44 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "The special bond that exists between Ather and Keegan has been there since before you guys got here, and will likely still be when you're gone."

04:40:51 You chuckle.

04:41:02 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which is likelier to happen than the departure of Keegan Wantz, or myself."

04:41:09 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I guess he is referring to Alyssara and yeah i'm surprised he still sees her that is really desolate."

04:41:10 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Indeed, indeed."

04:41:13 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You all being gone, that is."

04:41:21 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:41:21 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Except for Nissi."

04:41:25 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "True."

04:41:26 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "She's still here too."

04:41:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "She's a museum piece just like us."

04:41:45 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Cesar's rotting in a jail cell at the moment, sadly."

04:42:05 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We shall work tirelessly to free him!"

04:42:31 You ask, "Yeah, so all the girls can swoon over him again?"

04:43:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead! Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be annoying, but... but... oh God, I've wasted my life."

04:43:33 Lily Kaise says, "You know this whole thing with Aisling and her wanting to go back to her family's Gemship? I guess the Mutuality unregs have a different perspective concerning allowing pilots to go back to their home stations or ships."

04:43:42 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes yes performance goal guy, some days I'm fairly sure I wasted my life too."

04:43:58 Lily Kaise says, "We certainly wouldn't be permitted to go back home to repair our family homes."

04:44:10 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:44:17 Lily Kaise says, "Not that I'd need to but there may be pilots whose families aren't very well off."

04:44:25 You say, "I'm sure."

04:44:53 Lily Kaise says, "But you know we could rarely get a pass to leave our restricted areas."

04:44:59 You say, "Exactly."

04:45:09 You punch a few commands into your personal credit assistant and receive the following display:

04:45:09

04:45:48 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

04:45:54 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

04:46:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:46:06 Lily Kaise says, "But yeah it might not be a good idea for any AEU to participate in that."

04:46:11 You nod.

04:46:22 You say, "Probably not."

04:46:57 Lily Kaise says, "I guess ATher will go though. I don't know how he gets away with it but..."

04:47:19 You say, "He's an Ace. He can probably get away with a lot of stuff."

04:47:28 Lily Kaise says, "Well that's not the point."

04:47:35 You say, "And he's the only active Ace."

04:47:40 You say, "From the AEu."

04:47:43 You say, "I know, but."

04:47:43 Lily Kaise says, "He is an ace because of his piloting and combat skills."

04:47:59 Lily Kaise says, "Otherwise, he would be a Veteran."

04:48:28 Lily Kaise says, "But I'd think our Government wouldn't readily approve."

04:48:33 You nod.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of mystic purple suede clogs, a stretchy long-sleeved light purple top with a brightly colored star print, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, a lilac satin push-up bra, and a pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties here.

20:44:59 [Tactical Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Did you get a crew for beacons?"

20:45:16 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Only you, if you want we can do a couple."

20:45:19 [Tactical Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Ok."

20:45:24 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Be there soon."

20:45:27 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Miscomm."

20:46:52 [Tactical Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Have room for one more?"

20:58:45 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

20:58:46 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:04:45 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

21:06:45 Mischief the large black felo gazes at Prissy the big violet long-haired felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

21:10:45 Mischief the large black felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

21:12:45 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

21:14:33 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What is going on?"

21:14:45 Mischief the large black felo curls up and closes its eyes.

21:15:00 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Trying to get some beacons going, Kerry need a minute or two, I think."

21:15:45 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

21:17:17 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

21:21:35 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:21:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:21:40 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:21:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:21:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:21:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:22:01 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:22:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:22:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

21:22:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:22:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:22:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:22:09 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:22:10 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

21:22:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:22:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:22:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:22:14 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:22:15 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

21:22:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:22:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:22:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:22:19 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

21:22:22 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

21:22:22 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:22:29 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

21:22:32 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

21:22:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:22:41 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

21:22:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:22:43 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:22:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris (nearest).

21:22:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:23:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:23:13 Lily Kaise activates the expert salvage electromagnetic manipulator and begins scanning for debris.

21:23:18 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:23:20 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be some starship debris.

21:23:21 There is no more nearby debris.

21:23:24 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:23:26 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

21:23:27 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

21:23:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:23:39 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Anyone want to do Tesla or anything?"

21:23:54 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Give me like ten minutes and then sure. I'd love to."

21:23:57 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Ok."

21:24:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:24:01 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:24:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:24:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:24:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:24:16 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at Pengyou Homelife; Mail Room.

21:24:18 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

21:24:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:24:19 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Same."

21:24:24 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Sweet!"

21:24:41 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:24:42 Lily Kaise glides out.

21:24:44 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:35:45 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

21:37:28 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Guys, don't forget you still have six op cans."

21:37:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo."

21:38:44 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What the heck is a space dog."

21:38:50 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Is that like a roid dog?"

21:38:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "A space dog."

21:38:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

21:39:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's quite different."

21:39:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Also, hi everybody."

21:39:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "The hell is a roid dog?"

21:39:47 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Roid dog, space dog, what the? And hi."

21:39:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is a very big difference."

21:40:02 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "What are they."

21:40:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "How do you know? Have you seen a roid dog?"

21:40:07 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "One barks, and the other doesn't?"

21:40:12 [General Communication] Jada Nelson giggles.

21:40:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's kinda the point. No one that I know of has actually seen a roid dog. Space dogs...I've seen one of them myself."

21:40:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Roid dogs are kinda like Sasquatch."

21:40:46 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oy."

21:40:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

21:41:03 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I heard someone thought they heard one at that asteroid place that was way far out. Probably should have used the asteroid cannon to hogtie it and bring it home for study."

21:41:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

21:41:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "He meant, do they look like dogs? Which, yes they kinda do but not exactly."

21:41:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They do kinda, yeah. Well space dogs do. I'm lookin for my album, hang on."

21:41:45 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:43:25 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Don't nkow if it was truly a roid dog, but there was someone a long time ago who had their airlock riped apart by something large on an asteroid attacking their ship, I believe there's a photo of that floating around somewhere."

21:43:40 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yeah, somebody told me about that."

21:43:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ather's told me about that bot won't produce the photo."

21:43:46 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Oh dang."

21:44:03 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I still have a suspicion that they might really be some other form of asteroid harvesting Replicator."

21:44:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Dunno."

21:44:27 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, they like all the metals on other stuff.. why not asteroids."

21:44:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:46:58 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Chained To The Rhythm". The organization has earned 240,094.62 credits.

21:48:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I so hate when I can't find somethin."

21:48:52 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Know the feeling."

21:48:59 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Try in the storage room northeast corner, under that pile of dirty underwear."

21:49:08 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:49:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

21:49:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Or else, do what I do, ask the computer. It usually gives me unhelpful advice though. Dmaned gigo."

21:50:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's ok what I love is when I have a brilliant idea, then realize 3 or 4 sectors into it, that I"m in the wrong ship."

21:50:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:51:02 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I did that today."

21:51:11 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Tried to salvage in a rental fighter."

21:51:29 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Whoops."

21:51:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yep. And other such words."

21:52:08 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Took me a while to figure out why my light transport couldn't salvage, it was because I wasn't in it."

21:52:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. One more place to check."

21:56:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There ya go Eli."

21:56:42 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What's this Morris?"

21:56:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Album."

21:57:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "With a space dog."

21:57:16 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh.. You could have just said they came from a spawning zone."

21:57:31 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe you did and Imissed it. Thanks though for sure. I'll check it out."

21:57:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Didn't realize that woulda done it."

21:57:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a copy, so you can keep it."

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:46 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"

22:03:45 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyone looking for a nest for any reason?"

22:04:04 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Possibly in a couple hours."

22:04:29 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Thre's one 3 sectors galactic west of beacon a-29."

22:05:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wal
22:05:12 l-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

22:29:02 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Tesla."

22:29:19 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Ooh! Do you have room for one more for Tesla?"

22:29:36 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Seeing that it's just me, there's room for any amount, yes."

22:29:38 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales laughs.

22:29:49 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "I'll be there pretty soon. I just want to grab this one upgrade."

22:29:58 Your communicator reports that...

23:27:06 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:27:08 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

23:27:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:27:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:27:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:27:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:27:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:27:21 The ship is already moving.

23:27:24 The ship is already moving.

23:27:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:27:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:27:26 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:27:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

23:27:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:27:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:27:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:27:33 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:27:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

23:28:38 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

23:28:38 Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

23:29:50 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Personally Melinda, a person is not an asshole because they refuse to let someone they do not know fly. Nor did I hear her ask to fly. You did however go there and then stepped on my toes by offering to fly a beacon because I did not want her to fly. I was willing to let her on the ship just not behind the controls. Get all the facts before you use condensending words again please."

23:30:02 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:30:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "A person is an asshole if they just ignore somebody."

23:30:17 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I never heard her ask."

23:30:22 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:30:25 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And still would have said no."

23:30:33 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Then why didn't you say that instad of acting like you did?"

23:30:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:30:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:30:53 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Because you flat out called me an asshole without knowing everything."

23:30:54 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Somebody else needs to launch the beacon."

23:30:59 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "On it."

23:31:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:31:16 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Katina, you are welcome to fly beacons any time I run them."

23:31:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I did not, we told you she asked and you acted put out instead of saying you didn't hear her. So, I called you an asshole and will say it again if you like."

23:31:26 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Human beacon thrall Ali Candan."

23:31:33 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Sorry Vernos was being a jerk."

23:32:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Plus that comment you made about leaguers in general. Keep it coming boy."

23:32:11 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "ASS HOLE!"

23:32:15 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I will wait for the winces of pain to subside."

23:32:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ow. I'm awake now."

23:32:47 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yet you comment on AEU all the time, keep it coming. It goes both ways."

23:32:50 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hey Ather, can I get the number to the doc you got your eyes done at? I might want to replace my hearing so I can tune feedback out."

23:33:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

23:33:05 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, that would be Doc Stavros!"

23:33:12 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I only speak the truth about the AEU and we all know it. Y'all got a lot of work to do."

23:33:45 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I did."

23:33:54 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "By not allowing a cadet to fly."

23:34:07 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That is not even true."

23:34:14 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Which asshole? There's a few."

23:34:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh."

23:34:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You could have given her the decency of telling her no or why."

23:34:26 [General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Third one from the left."

23:34:29 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I never heard her."

23:34:33 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "And you were a cadet when I let you fly. What the hell is the difference?"

23:34:41 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It was not a gunship."

23:34:50 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It soon was."
