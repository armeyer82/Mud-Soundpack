02:37:40 Lily Kaise says, "Ok then we're off to get modules and then some food."

02:37:43 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Lexie would you want a Nest?"

02:37:43 Lily Kaise grins.

02:37:44 You grin.

02:37:46 You remove Shule Elemmire's workbench from a leather briefcase.

02:37:49 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:37:50 You put Shule Elemmire's workbench in a leather briefcase.

02:37:54 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:37:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Star Of Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:37:57 You say, "Good, just wanted to make sure I had it."

02:38:01 Lily Kaise nods.

02:38:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:38:09 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:38:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:38:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38:14 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:38:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38:17 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38:18 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

02:38:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38:23 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38:24 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:38:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38:28 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

02:38:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38:33 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:38:36 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Star Of Destiny. Welcome to Accord space."

02:38:39 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:38:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

02:38:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:39:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:39:11 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:39:16 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

02:39:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:39:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:39:31 Lily says to you, "Oh did you change your points contribution? I'm hopeful this would be the last time you would need to?"

02:39:42 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:39:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:39:45 You ask, "It's set to 0. Should I change it?"

02:40:11 Lily Kaise says, "Yes because I would like to get points for the org. We still need 52 Exploration."

02:40:18 You nod.

02:40:24 You say, "Ok, I'll change it."

02:40:29 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Rocka Rolla". The organization has earned 1,015,851.40 credits.

02:40:32 You say, "We'll have to go back so I can change it."

02:40:38 Lily Kaise says, "Then if we have to go out again, next time, I'd be the only one whould would need to."

02:40:43 You nod.

02:40:47 Lily Kaise asks, "Is that ok?"

02:40:54 You smile. "Yep, sounds great."

02:40:59 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:41:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:41:06 Lily Kaise says, "Ok then off to go buy parts."

02:41:09 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:41:09 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:41:09 You grin.

02:41:11 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:42:06 You scramble to your feet.

02:42:06 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Main Deck]
You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

02:42:11 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

02:42:11 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

02:42:11 You see a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south and out.

02:43:09 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise has used 1 megacredits on a temporary space station core module and placed it aboard the two-person Accord space module scout "Probable Solution".

02:44:57 The spaceport has loaded the two-person Accord space module scout "Probable Solution" into this ship.

02:45:03 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:45:04 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:45:07 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:45:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:45:28 Lily Kaise says, "We'll go back to New Earth so you can set your points."

02:45:32 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:45:33 You nod.

02:45:34 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:45:35 You smile.

02:45:39 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

02:45:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:45:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:45:54 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:45:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:45:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:45:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:46:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:46:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:46:02 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:46:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:46:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:46:07 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:46:10 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Star Of Destiny! Welcome to home space!"

02:46:17 Lily Kaise says, "I'll go grab a couple of breakfast sandwiches and things."

02:46:19 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:46:20 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:46:21 You say, "Ok."

02:46:22 You grin.

02:46:23 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:46:26 Lily Kaise grins.

02:46:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:46:56 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:47:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Star Of Destiny. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:47:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:47:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:47:13 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:47:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:53:18 The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life, with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Centauri in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:53:21 Via general sector communication, Centauri transmits, "Greetings, Star Of Destiny! Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"

02:53:23 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:53:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Centauri.

02:53:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:53:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:53:40 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:53:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Star Of Destiny. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:53:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:53:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:53:57 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:53:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:53:59 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:54:00 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:54:01 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:00:24 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:00:26 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:00:30 Lily Kaise closes a compact white refrigerator.

03:00:34 Lily Kaise puts a compact white refrigerator in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:00:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok!"

03:00:40 You grin.

03:00:58 Lily Kaise asks, "'anything else?"

03:01:06 You say, "I don't think so for now."

03:01:10 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:01:12 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:01:14 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:01:14 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:01:19 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:01:29 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:01:34 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:01:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Star Of Destiny, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

03:01:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:01:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:01:54 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:01:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:01:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

03:01:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:02:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:02:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:02:05 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:02:05 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Star Of Destiny, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

03:02:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to The Cross.

03:02:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:02:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:02:59 You feel the ship shudder slightly as it approaches a quantum skim accelerator.

03:03:00 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "New Crafting supplies on the Market."

03:03:02 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:03:03 The computer announces, "Initiating connection with The Cross's local quantum skim accelerator network."

03:03:28 The computer announces, "Connection established. Communicating between quantum skim acceleration gates now."

03:08:05 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "All useful to me."

03:08:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:08:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:08:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:08:12 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:08:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Farport."

03:08:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:08:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:08:26 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

03:08:28 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

03:08:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:09:02 The starship transitions into another sector.

03:09:04 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

03:09:06 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

03:09:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:09:07 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

03:09:18 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:09:24 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:09:27 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

03:09:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 359,017.87 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

03:09:28 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:09:38 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:09:38 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:20:24 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:20:27 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:20:30 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:20:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:20:32 You say to Lily, "I love you."

04:20:39 Lily says to you, "I love you too."

04:20:43 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:20:44 You beam.

04:20:46 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:20:48 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

04:20:53 A launch trajectory is located.

04:20:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:21:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:21:07 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

04:21:07 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 2.0.

04:21:16 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

04:21:16 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:21:26 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:21:26 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:21:27 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:21:36 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

04:21:42 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

04:21:42 The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching over a stone.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 0.0.

04:22:10 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:22:10 A readout shows The Glyphmakers' Grave about 21.61 light-days toward Galactic Westnorthwest.
A temporary beacon appears to be 30.51 light-days away toward Galactic East.

04:22:26 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

04:22:26 The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching over a stone.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

04:22:26 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:22:27 A readout shows The Glyphmakers' Grave about 11.24 light-days toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.
A temporary beacon appears to be 40.84 light-days away toward Galactic East.

04:22:37 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

04:22:37 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:22:41 Lily Kaise applauds sedately.

04:22:44 Lily Kaise grins.

04:22:44 You grin.

04:22:52 You reset the starship's mileage meter.

04:23:01 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

04:23:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:23:07 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (13, 18, 6)

04:23:12 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (13, 19, 6)

04:23:19 Lily Kaise turns on the silent running feature.

04:46:51 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

04:46:51 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.

05:13:56 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

05:13:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go up and out.

05:35:26 (20 seconds roundtime.)

05:35:46 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

05:35:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a small seashell pink trash can here.
You can go up and out.

05:35:47 Lily Kaise (League Paladin) returns from deep space.

05:35:49 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

05:35:49 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, an AEU Combat Universalist, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.
You collect the items you retrieved from the battle and place them into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

05:35:51 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

05:35:51 Average Starship Damage: 0%

05:35:51 
Hull damage failsafes remaining: 50% and 97%

05:36:01 I can't find "couch."

05:36:03 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:36:11 Lily says to you, "Ok should we head back or do we have time to look for another one?"

05:36:14 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:36:18 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:36:21 You say, "I think we should head back unfortunately."

05:36:31 Lily Kaise says, "Ok Love, no problem."

05:36:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:36:36 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."

05:36:37 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:36:47 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:36:47 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:36:47 The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:36:57 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

05:37:24 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:37:24 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:37:28 There are no other ships in the sector.

05:37:39 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:37:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station.

05:37:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:37:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:37:57 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

05:38:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

05:38:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:48:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Gwendolen Jones transmits, "There old earth and new earth old mexico and new mexico well at least there was. New york is still around I wonder what hapened to old york?"

05:48:56 Lily Kaise smiles.

05:48:58 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:50:12 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:50:23 Lily Kaise says, "Wow nice."

05:50:28 You grin.

05:50:29 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That was quick!"

05:50:33 You say, "It was."

05:50:46 Lily Kaise removes Lily Kaise's workbench from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

05:50:49 Lily Kaise puts down Lily Kaise's workbench.

05:50:51 Lily Kaise's workbench isn't yours.

05:52:53 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, an AEU Combat Universalist, a League Paladin, and Lily Kaise's workbench here.

14:02:51 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.

17:12:29 You grin. "Yep."

17:12:38 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I can do quite a few too."

17:12:40 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

17:12:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:12:43 You smile.

17:12:44 Lily Kaise removes a clear plastic food storage container from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

17:12:48 Lily Kaise puts down a clear plastic food storage container.

17:12:52 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

17:12:57 A launch trajectory is located.

17:12:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:12:58 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

17:13:04 There are no other ships in the sector.

17:13:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:13:13 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

17:13:13 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 1.0.

17:13:17 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

17:13:18 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

17:13:27 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

17:13:27 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

17:13:28 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

17:13:37 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

17:14:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."

17:14:11 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

17:14:11 The endless pathways of webbing twist around a bend.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

17:14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi there."

17:14:26 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

17:14:26 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:14:33 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

17:14:33 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 1.0.

17:15:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:15:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Constantine. I was busy here with rift drive controls. Good day to you."

17:15:27 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

17:15:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries, good day to you as well. Rifting anywhere good?"

17:15:36 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

17:15:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:15:41 You turn on the silent running feature.

17:15:51 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:15:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh we're out here plundering the Glyphmakers."

17:15:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool!"

17:16:02 You grin.

17:16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, does it seem like our statement fell on deaf ears?"

17:16:15 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:16:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup it's probably my favorite work t) do."

17:16:24 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:16:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "To do as well!"

17:19:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do I get to 777?"

17:19:43 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:19:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Go to Mir and then travel to 777."

17:19:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. And is there a salvage processor out there?"

17:20:13 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We don't have inserters though so do you have a rift drive?"

17:20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't realize that. No, I don't have one yet."

17:20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Belt of orion for me, then."

17:20:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "See join SEAS and you would be set!"

17:20:47 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:20:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

17:20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

17:20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

17:20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll talk when you get back."

A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

17:21:33 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

17:21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, not at all."

17:21:36 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:21:37 Lily Kaise glides up.

17:21:38 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

17:21:39 I don't see "lily" here.

17:59:51 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

17:59:51 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, and a clear plastic food storage container here.

18:23:45 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

19:04:45 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

19:04:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.

19:05:13 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

19:05:13 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:05:15 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:05:23 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:05:23 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:05:24 The starship has left a unique area of space.

19:05:24 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:05:33 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

19:05:40 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

19:05:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They seem to prefer being out of comms to in comms, so maybe we should leave them in peace."

19:05:43 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well when I get back in. I wrote up a short hand on the one about the AEU one. I shouldn't be long out here at GMG."

19:05:48 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

19:05:55 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:06:00 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:06:00 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

19:06:11 You're already sitting.

19:06:13 There are no other ships in the sector.

19:06:18 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

19:06:21 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well, last time they said they liked getting the updates, it gave them things to talk about."

19:06:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station.

19:06:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:06:47 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Be back in about an hour."

19:06:49 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Maybe they should get to know some new people then."

19:07:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:07:01 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

19:07:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person flying wing "Stormy Skies".

19:07:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

19:07:09 Lily says to you, "All right Love. SEe you upon your return!"

19:07:14 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "In fact, I think that's where they are headed currently."

19:07:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:07:18 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

19:07:23 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

19:07:36 You say to Lily, "See you in about an hour."

19:07:41 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:07:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I meant, for the trip itself."

19:07:42 Lily Kaise says, "All right love."

20:21:05 Lily Kaise kisses you.

20:21:13 Lily Kaise asks, "Hey Love you ready?"

20:21:23 You grin. "Yep."

20:21:27 Lily Kaise beams.

20:21:32 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

20:21:37 A launch trajectory is located.

20:21:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:21:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:21:58 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

20:21:58 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 1.0.

20:22:06 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

20:22:06 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

20:22:16 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

20:22:16 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

20:22:17 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

20:22:26 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

20:22:36 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

20:22:36 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

20:23:14 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

20:23:15 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 1.0.

20:23:16 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

20:23:16 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

20:23:21 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

20:23:34 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

20:23:39 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

20:23:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:23:44 You turn on the silent running feature.

20:23:48 Lily Kaise grins.

20:23:52 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

20:23:52 You grin.

20:24:08 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

20:24:20 Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

20:24:47 Lily Kaise carefully turns a few small knobs on the broadcaster control board.

20:24:47 A number flap display rapidly flips around to indicate that the broadcaster is now aimed at 35.0, 10.0.

20:24:54 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

   A miniscule energy signature presently detected 50.67 light-days toward Galactic East

20:24:55 Lily Kaise presses a prominent identification button on the hypercaster control board.

20:25:34 Lily Kaise says into the hypercaster microphone, "Haloooooo!"

20:25:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:25:45 You laugh.

20:25:46 You grin.

20:29:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

20:32:45 The ship's current engine speed is 26667 km/s.

20:32:46 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

20:32:50 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

20:32:52 The nav mode is already on autopilot.

20:32:53 Lily Kaise beams.

20:32:55 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:32:57 I don't understand that.

20:32:59 Lily Kaise kisses you.

20:32:59 You kiss Lily Kaise.

20:33:00 You grin.

20:48:26 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

20:48:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

21:23:37 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

21:23:37 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, Lily Kaise's workbench, a compact white refrigerator, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.

Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

21:24:20 You are carrying a mug in your right hand.

21:24:24 You put a mug in a small seashell pink trash can.

21:24:46 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

21:54:26 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

21:54:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:32:38 (20 seconds roundtime.)

22:32:58 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

22:32:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact purple microwave oven, Lily Kaise's workbench, a compact white refrigerator, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

23:15:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 968,659.56 credits.

23:15:57 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I fully understand the concerns for each suit."

23:17:21 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

23:17:39 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

23:17:42 There are no other ships in the sector.

23:17:57 Lily Kaise says, "Ok swith'changing directions."

23:18:03 Lily Kaise says, "Haha eyah."

23:18:40 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

23:18:47 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

23:18:47 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."

23:18:47 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

23:18:58 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

23:18:58 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

23:18:59 The starship has left a unique area of space.

23:19:07 Listen. You need to be careful.

23:19:41 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:19:41 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

23:19:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

23:19:52 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station.

23:20:20 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

23:20:21 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:20:24 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

23:20:30 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

23:20:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

23:20:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:21:02 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Perhaps if we wait awhile, things will pop again!"

23:21:07 You grin.
