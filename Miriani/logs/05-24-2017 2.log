00:49:29 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "I could."

00:49:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:49:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:49:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

00:49:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:49:50 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:49:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:49:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:50:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, meet me in the lounge on New Earth."

00:50:24 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:50:34 The advanced scout "Celtic Rose", the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Mu-0", and the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Kappa-5" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:50:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Be there soon."

00:50:38 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
You can go out.

00:50:39 A seagull flaps by the window.

00:50:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Awesome."

00:51:39 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

00:53:10 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

00:53:10 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.

00:55:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah. Ain't that the fun part? Hmmm. I need a top. Let's go ship hunting. Damn it I need a battery. Let's go ship hunting again."

00:55:38 You say, "No problem."

00:56:35 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Cant have a ship named "Tops"?"

00:56:41 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

00:56:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well no, because then we'd need a ship for every part. That...Oh my fuck no."

00:57:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

00:57:18 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That would blow."

00:57:29 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I would name that ship, This ship goes topless."

Guindalen Jones followed you.

00:58:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:58:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:58:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:58:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:58:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:58:23 The ship is already moving.

00:58:24 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 966" has jumped out of the sector.

00:58:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:58:25 Which sector did you mean?

00:58:25

[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Had to try."

00:58:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

00:58:31 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:58:31 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

00:58:32 Guindalen Jones asks, "Oh one quick question. What weapons im I useing?"

00:58:33 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "How far is 287 from the bubble now?"

00:58:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:58:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:58:35 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:58:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:27:35 You say, "Ok."

01:27:41 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

01:27:42 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 966" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

01:27:42 Your ship 'Striking Distance' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:27:52 You peer out...

01:27:52 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The advanced scout "Celtic Rose", the two-person Accord gemini "Galactic Tornado", and the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 966" are landed here.

01:28:36 Alko Delovega exclaims, "For sure,I need that!"

01:28:40 You grin.

01:28:41 You disband your group.

01:28:45 Alko Delovega grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from him.

01:28:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:28:46 You say, "I'll engineer then."

01:28:50 Alko Delovega laughs.

01:28:54 Alko Delovega says, "Thanks much."

01:29:03 Alko Delovega uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:29:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:29:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:29:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:29:19 Alko Delovega presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:29:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:29:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:29:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:29:23 You say, "Wait to launch the beacon until Guindalen is ready."

01:29:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:31:04 
[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:16:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:16:16 Guindalen Jones says, "Just the exploring all over."

02:16:21 You grin.

02:16:34 You say, "Yeah, I did that a lot when I first started out as a pilot."

02:16:36 Guindalen Jones says, "Every place has somthing to find."

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
02:26:52 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 17 April 2317 GST. Time remaining: 4 days, 23 hours, 34 minutes, and 39 seconds

02:35:03 Guindalen Jones

02:35:03 She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with slightly curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has broad shoulders and somewhat large breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and unblemished, with a delicate nose and round chin. Her lips are soft and pinkish red and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and round. Her mid-back length, soft with a slight wave hair is light auburn and drawn back in pigtails. She has neatly trimmed pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a pair of soft and furry saffron felo ears, a necklace of twisted deep green and pale peach beads, a simple short-sleeved buttercup yellow silk dress, and a pair of sandy brown slingback sandals. She is also wearing a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a small cloth sack, a yellow canvas backpack, a metachannel FTL communicator, a gold flightbag, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a knotted kelp bracelet with yellow beads, and a steel Celtic knot keyring. Her face, both eyes, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying a temporary wormhole drive in her left hand.

02:44:03 You say, "I don't think there is a point requirement. You just can't get one as a cadet."

02:47:01 a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair

02:47:01 This state of the art starship gunner's chair is upholstered in dark gray leather and has a polished steel frame. The high back, seat, and armrests are firmly but deeply padded to mitigate even the most extreme effects of starship combat. The chair swivels smoothly from side to side to provide an extended reach of weapon controls.
There is nothing on there.

02:47:16 Guindalen Jones asks, "What do you like about piloting?"

02:47:46 Shule scoots over next to a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair and places a hand on the armrest, "I like the freedom and variety it offers."

03:09:21 Guindalen Jones says, "I might be more into less clothing rather than none in one area or another."

03:09:35 Shule reaches over and absent mindedly plays with your hair, then realizing what he's doing, he quickly pulls his hand away.

03:09:39 You nod to Guindalen Jones.

03:13:11 You say, "Ok, I won't play with your hair anymore."

03:13:58 You say to Guindalen, "So, besides the space to breath. Why else did you become a pilot?"

03:14:07 Guindalen Jones says, "Just how they don't want pilots to make personal relations that's all."

03:15:04 Guindalen Jones says, "That's the most of it. I go too tired of what family kept on expecting of me and needing to push aside my wants and desires so I decided to excape to the stars."

03:15:12 You nod to Guindalen Jones.

03:15:29 You say, "Well, there are a lot of relationships among the pilot corps."

03:17:27 Guindalen Jones smiles at you.

03:17:44 You say, "And actually, the AEU refuses to allow pilots to get married. The League has allowed some pilots to get married."

03:18:01 Guindalen Jones asks, "Realy?"

03:18:04 You nod.

03:18:10 Guindalen Jones says, "Now that's interesting."

03:18:14 You say, "The AEU won't recognize a marriage."

03:18:27 Guindalen Jones says, "Do you know how long the marages last."

03:18:35 You say, "Some have been for years."

03:18:41 Guindalen Jones says, "Wow."

03:19:25 Guindalen Jones says, "I could imagie migrent workers not staying faithfull."

03:19:56 Guindalen Jones says, "Being the whole reason for not permiting marrage."

03:19:56 You say, "It really depends on the people. Some can, some can't."

03:20:09 Guindalen Jones says, "So true."

03:20:16 You nod to Guindalen Jones.

03:21:11 You say, "Some pilots have even been known to do things for sexual favors. Won't say any names..."

03:21:23 Guindalen Jones says, "Not me."

03:21:25 You say, "I'm not one of those."

03:21:35 You nod to Guindalen Jones. "Me neither."

03:22:12 Guindalen Jones says, "If you get into that its nothing but a slipery slope and wonder when will it stop."

03:22:25 You say, "Most certainly."

03:22:27 Guindalen Jones says, "If you do for one another comes along and wants you to do it for them."

03:22:33 You say, "Exactly."

03:23:47 You say, "Anyways, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable."

03:24:08 You say, "I'm just saying what sometimes takes place."

03:24:28 Guindalen Jones says, "Im fine."

03:24:32 You smile at Guindalen Jones.

03:25:11 Guindalen Jones smiles.

03:25:48 "I'm sure that some pilots will take a romantic interest in you." You smile at Guindalen Jones. "How could they resist someone as cute as you."

03:26:01 Guindalen Jones grins.

03:26:12 Guindalen Jones says, "Thanks."

03:26:30 Guindalen Jones says, "Your not bad to look at yourself."

03:27:59 Guindalen Jones says, "Ah."

03:28:04 You smile.

03:28:11 Guindalen Jones asks, "Whos the lucky one?"

03:28:22 You say, "Lily."

03:28:31 You say, "And it's not her that's lucky, it's me."

03:28:33 Guindalen Jones says, "Defanetly lucky."

03:29:07 You say, "Yeah, I'm most definitely lucky."

03:29:09 You grin.

03:29:12 Guindalen Jones says, "For two soles to find each other and not want to part they are both lucky."

03:29:22 You smile. "Very true."

03:29:54 You say, "We've been together for over a year now."

03:30:01 Guindalen Jones says, "That's great."

03:30:02 You say, "Almost a year and a half."

03:30:52 You say, "She wasn't even interested in relationships."

03:30:54 You laugh.

03:31:03 Guindalen Jones says, "Aww."

03:31:27 You say, "Took many montsh to convince her that I was worth taking a risk with."

03:31:47 Guindalen Jones says, "Some people just take time."

03:32:02 You say, "Yep, and that's totally ok."

03:32:04 You grin.

03:39:11 You pat Shule Elemmire's workbench lightly.

03:39:18 You say, OOCly, "Ugh, sorry."

03:39:23 Guindalen Jones snickers.

03:39:30 You say, "I never leave home without mine."

03:39:32 Guindalen Jones says, OOCly, "Its fine."

03:39:51 Guindalen Jones says, "Well for me home is not far away from my ship."

03:39:56 You grin.

03:39:59 Guindalen Jones says, "Oh wait it is my ship."

03:40:05 Guindalen Jones smirks.

03:40:08 You say, "I used to sleep in my ships at first."

03:40:13 You grin.

03:40:19 You exclaim, "Oh wait, I still do!"

03:40:23 You laugh.

03:40:27 Guindalen Jones laughs.

03:40:58 Guindalen Jones says, "Well I plan to get an appartment but I want to get some more cash in my bank before I do."

03:41:13 You say, "Well, technicaly not my ship, but it's Lily's ship. Yeah, that's understandable. Apartments are nice."

03:41:32 You say, "I have an apartment out at the Calm, but I never sleep there."

03:41:38 Guindalen Jones says, "Like the ones with hot tubs."

03:41:44 You grin.

03:41:54 Guindalen Jones says, "I want one."

03:41:56 Guindalen Jones snickers.

03:42:03 Guindalen Jones says, "But it will be a while."

03:42:12 You say to Guindalen, "Well, you could use my hot tub until you can get your own apartment. I'm almost never over there."

03:42:22 You say, "So, no risk of me walking in on you."

03:42:54 Guindalen Jones gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:43:03 Guindalen Jones says, "I might take you up on that."

03:43:08 You smile.

03:43:25 You say, "And I promise not to walk in on you."

03:43:41 Guindalen Jones says, "Well ill have my swim suit on."

03:43:46 You grin.

03:43:53 Guindalen Jones says, "Its blue."

03:44:02 You ask, "Is blue your favorite color?"

03:44:06 Guindalen Jones says, "Nope."

03:44:15 Guindalen Jones says, "But I know I look good in it."

03:44:19 You grin at Guindalen Jones.

03:44:38 Guindalen Jones says, "I prefer yellow buttercup expecialy."

03:44:46 Guindalen Jones says, "But yellow."

03:44:53 a simple short-sleeved buttercup yellow silk dress

03:44:53 Deceptively simple, this dress is made of ultra fine buttercup yellow silk. It has short sleeves, a softly rounded neckline, and a hemline a few inches above the knee, for a timeless, feminine look.
It covers both your shoulders, both biceps, both hips, both thighs, chest, back, abdomen, waist, and groin.

03:45:01 You ask, "Like your dress?"

03:45:09 Guindalen Jones nods.

03:45:12 You smile.

03:45:14 Guindalen Jones says, "That's why I got it."

03:45:18 You say, "It looks good on you."

03:45:22 Guindalen Jones says, "Thank you."

03:47:15 You say, "Well, if you do decide to take me up on that offer. I just need to give you acess to the apartment. Like I said, I'm never over there so you can use it for whatever you'd like. Sleep there if you wish."

03:47:41 Guindalen Jones says, "I might a time or two."

03:47:52 You smile. "Go for it."

03:47:57 Guindalen Jones smiles.

03:48:12 You ask, "Want me to go ahead and give you access?"

03:48:45 Guindalen Jones says, "Please."

03:48:53 You smile.

03:48:59 You hold Guindalen Jones's hand, taking her into your group.

03:49:00 You stand up.

03:49:03 You say, "Come on."

03:49:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

03:49:04 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

03:49:08 [Starship "Firestorm"; Weapons Room]

03:49:08 You see a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair here.

03:49:10 You hold Guindalen Jones's hand, taking her into your group.

03:49:12 [Starship "Firestorm"; Weapons Room]

03:49:12 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:49:23 You peer down...

03:49:23 
[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Guindalen Jones followed you.

03:49:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:49:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:49:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:50:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:50:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:50:06 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Alpha-5" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:50:08 Starships In Sector:

AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Alpha-5.....(5, 13, 11)

03:50:11 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Alpha-5" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:50:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:50:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:50:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:50:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:50:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:50:20 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Alpha-5" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:50:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:50:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:50:22 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

03:51:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:51:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:51:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:51:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:51:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:51:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:51:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:00:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:00:50 Guindalen Jones says, "Oh question how would you enter? I see go to the floor."

04:00:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:00:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:00:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:01:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:01:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:01:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:01:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:01:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:01:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:01:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

04:02:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:02:07 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:02:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:02:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:02:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:02:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:02:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:02:27 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:02:31 You smile.

04:02:37 Guindalen Jones nods.

04:02:38 Guindalen Jones smiles.

04:02:48 Guindalen Jones says, "Thank you again."

04:02:54 You say, "You are most welcome."

04:20:54 Hey sexy!
As I told you the other day, I rented an apartment on New Earth. I'm still in the process of furnishing it. You're welcome to help me if you're up to it. I'm terrible at decorating! 
I'd hang out now, but Lily could show up to work any time now. If she doesn't show up to work within the hour, then she's probably not working at all today. In that case, if you'd like to hang out, come knock on my pulsar. Can't wait to see you soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

10:22:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there anywhere good to search for artifacts besides battle of mir?"

10:23:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "There is, but that location is currently only available to people who have a rift drive on their ships, and you don't."

10:24:03 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

10:24:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

10:24:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:24:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:24:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:24:10 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

10:24:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

10:24:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:24:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do I need for a rift drive?"

10:24:22 The ship is already moving.

10:24:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:24:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:24:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:24:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

10:24:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:24:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:24:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:24:32 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

10:24:35 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to Mir."

10:24:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "3000 industry points or 300 exploration, and 500 milion credits."

10:24:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "300 exploration or 3000 industry."

10:28:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The question is, where does your battlesuit need to go?"

10:28:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, it would be cheaper to just to forget my suit and buy a new one that buy that, I guess."

10:28:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And from where?"

10:28:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Old Earth to New Earth."

10:28:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:28:47 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

10:28:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

10:28:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

10:29:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

10:29:04 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:30:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That is true."

10:30:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So is the mule with fortress, they are used for nests, frontier cleanup, the megapod and other ground missions."

10:30:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That must run about 120 million though."

10:30:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Way more than i've got on hand."

10:31:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I actually lived out o my mule and fortress for a while."

10:31:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Pelican". The organization has earned 943,447.77 credits.

10:31:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, the fortress is expensive, so you will have to save up for it."

10:31:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I assume you still go roid hauling at frontier? Try 285 for a change? Or mining?"

10:31:54 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And another 6 in Clarkson's push."

10:32:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hauling I might take a break from for a bit, as I think I wrecked all my tools."

10:32:11 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Another 6 what?"

10:32:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll try it again after I play around with them for a while."

10:32:36 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Rat's heavy fighters, if anybody wants them."

10:33:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mining I haven't done much, but I've been trying to stick to stuff that gives me lots of points."

10:33:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Salvaging is getting better and better."

10:33:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm close to a medium transport."

10:33:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, it does. But salvaging will never give you many credits."

10:34:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That is true, I'm hoping that the points will mining much more lucrative when I get around to it."

10:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus I have other toys to play around with by getting points."

10:34:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Also, don't salvage too much, it may be good for the points and the conquest, but it is easier to give yourself a burnout than you think."

10:35:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd believe that."

10:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Mining is never a point activity. Even at my high level I only get 2 points at the most per mine."

10:35:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I just meant the money returns will be much better if I have more points."

10:36:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just from taking a look at the upgrades you can do."

10:36:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You could consider Tesla, for a mix of credits and points. But then you either need a ship to move your battlesuit, pay the tesla tech to move it for you, or ask a friend."

10:37:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, that's something I haven't tried yet."

10:37:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, the money will be better, bust trust me, start at a low level of points with mining, it is easier to get the hang of it that way."

12:13:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:13:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:13:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:13:16 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:13:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:13:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:13:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:13:25 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Helo."

12:13:28 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Err, hello."

12:13:30 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

12:13:32 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Luja."

12:13:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:13:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:13:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:13:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:13:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:13:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:13:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:13:44 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:13:44 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

12:14:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:14:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, gunship beacons are fun and good for conquest."

12:14:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:53:57 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:53:57 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
