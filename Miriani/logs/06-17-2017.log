01:03 ["Situation Critical" Weapons Room 1]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

02:05 You peer northeast and see...

02:05 ["Determined Destination" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a velvet-covered walnut crew chair and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

20:15 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Solar saturation complete. All systems go. Severing link with Decker Trisolar Catapult Array. Engaging vector displacement."

20:15 An intense burst of static begins emanating from every nearby radio. The lights dim momentarily as a barely perceptible rumbling vibrates the deck below you.

20:15 With no warning, the gravity in the room increases, pinning you to the floor. It sounds like the ship's computer is saying something, but you can't make the exact message out in the static.

20:15 With an abrupt and unexplainable popping sound, the gravity in the room fails entirely. You begin to feel the effects of weightlessness as the gravity plating returns to normal levels. You fall to the ground with an uncomfortable thud.

20:15 As the starship lurches forward ever so slightly, your ears pop. You glance out the window and see that it has been restored to nominal luminocity and the sector has changed.

20:16 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:16 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:16 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:27 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

21:27 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Muzano the droid, Ralf the droid, Rika the droid, Aria the droid, a glossy red security drone, a glossy green security drone, a slim violet security drone, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Puff the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Ponyo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom t

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

21:27 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

21:27 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

21:27 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

21:28 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

21:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

21:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:28 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

21:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

21:28 The ship must be in space to do that.

21:28 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

21:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:28 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

21:28 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:28 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:28 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:28 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:28 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

21:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

21:30 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

21:30 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:30 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

[Alliance Information Center]
The alliance information center is a small, oddly imposing room with three hallways running out of it. The walls are painted with a light shade of tan that seems to flow off the wall and blend seamlessly with the soft carpet beneath your feet. Above the doorway to each hall hangs a large, colorful emblem for the alliance within. A long, polished desk runs in a u-shape around the room, breaking only to allow entrance through one of the doors leading to the individual alliance information rooms. Behind the desk a number of men and women, all wearing the same style of impeccably tailored business suit, stare out into the group of new recruits, ready to help.

For help, type TALK REPRESENTATIVE.
You see a u-shaped desk, a helpful alliance representative (sitting at a u-shaped desk), and a transparent starship simulator here.

If you're new to Miriani, you can type TIPS to enable periodic tips for playing the game. Typing HELP alone will display a list of help topics available. A good starting point is HELP GETTING-STARTED. Have fun!

22:05 [05/29/17 - 4:29 p.m.] Announcement: A reminder that when you give tradesman items to people, you may wish to transfer them. Otherwise, when you retrieve your tradesman items, any items you've given to other people without transferring will come back to you and cause the poor, unfortunate people to be confused.

[Hale Information Center]
The Hale Collective, more often known simply as the Hale, is devoted solely to scientific endeavors. The vast majority of modern technologies that people use every day were developed by the Hale, a fact that its members often boast about. This tends to give them a reputation of being arrogant. They have no qualms with bringing their advanced technology to bear against those who challenge them in any respect. To become a member of this alliance, type CHOOSE now.

[Commonwealth Information Center]
The Commonwealth of Free Spirits, more commonly referred to as the Commonwealth, believe that humanity has become too violent and fragmented and should concentrate on improving the species before technological or territorial expansion. However, should they come under direct assault, the Commonwealth will not hesitate to defend themselves. While not as technologically advanced as the Hale, the Commonwealth has a number of impressive technologies at their disposal for deterring or, if necessary, eliminating their enemies.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex]
The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Kleos" landed here.

Four curving stone staircases spiral down from the noisy landing pad above and continue down to the lowest level of the spaceport. Between them, four wide archways lead off to brightly lit corridors. In the middle of this vast open space, the dark blue tiles from each of them come together in an X formation in the middle of the floor. There, a leafy plant has been carefully placed. Free-standing advertisements for the various facilities around the pyramid are scattered about, and the noise from the landing pad above echoes off the white tiled floor.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Starship Emporium]
Sturdy stone shelves line the two walls of this corner shop. Set neatly upon them, from floor to ceiling, are stacks of glass boxes holding scaled down replicas of each of the various starship classes. A young man sits behind a small counter in the middle of the store with a stack of papers set before him. A pair of tall glass-like cylinders in the front corners of the shop hold hundreds of keys which droids occasionally retrieve via a complex unlocking mechanism near the base. The yellow and green tiles covering the floor are triangular, and a Commonwealth flag is draped prominently across the front of the counter.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex]
The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Cascade" powered down here.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Kleos" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, froggy the droid, Tori the droid, Sumus the droid, Clara the droid, Hotdog the droid, Ema the droid, Charmed the droid, Aura the droid, Wish the droid, Meda the droid, Tom the droid, Jaden the droid, Holland the droid, Zhia the droid, Kano the droid, Daniel the droid, Daizey the droid, Fluffy the droid, Buttercup the droid, Elisha the droid, Robby the d

["Cascade" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex.
You can go down and out.

22:08 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:09 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

22:09 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Starship Garage]
Four dark brown granite staircases lead down from the gray granite floor of this cavernous garage. A tall ring of safety railings surround a series of metal platforms at the center of the space which move back and forth from the landing pad. Robotic arms in the ceiling carry starships to and from the platforms over the heads of a crowd of pilots moving past on the way to their destinations. A single stone staircase leads up the side of one dark brown wall towards a brightly lit room above.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Drone Storage]
A single stone staircase leading from the garage below curves upwards into this large glassed-in chamber. The granite floor has been faded to a dull off-white by the Sun which beats down through the domed glass ceiling during the day. An assortment of abandoned drones and droids stand silent in the center of the room, leaving a space around the perimeter empty. From this lofty vantage point atop the uppermost point of the spaceport, the entire capitol city is visible far below.

Four dark brown granite staircases lead down from the gray granite floor of this cavernous garage. A tall ring of safety railings surround a series of metal platforms at the center of the space which move back and forth from the landing pad. Robotic arms in the ceiling carry starships to and from the platforms over the heads of a crowd of pilots moving past on the way to their destinations. A single stone staircase leads up the side of one dark brown wall towards a brightly lit room above.

The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Kleos" landed here.

Sturdy stone shelves line the two walls of this corner shop. Set neatly upon them, from floor to ceiling, are stacks of glass boxes holding scaled down replicas of each of the various starship classes. A young man sits behind a small counter in the middle of the store with a stack of papers set before him. A pair of tall glass-like cylinders in the front corners of the shop hold hundreds of keys which droids occasionally retrieve via a complex unlocking mechanism near the base. The yellow and green tiles covering the floor are triangular, and a Commonwealth flag is draped prominently across the front of the counter.

Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Kleos" landed here.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Starship Garage]
Four dark brown granite staircases lead down from the gray granite floor of this cavernous garage. A tall ring of safety railings surround a series of metal platforms at the center of the space which move back and forth from the landing pad. Robotic arms in the ceiling carry starships to and from the platforms over the heads of a crowd of pilots moving past on the way to their destinations. A single stone staircase leads up the side of one dark brown wall towards a brightly lit room above.

["Cascade" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room.

A tall brightly painted safety railing surrounds the large circular patch of bright yellow on the blue tiled floor where the transport pod will enter through a hatch in the ceiling and land. Long wooden benches with colorful cushions upon them line the two walls of the pod station. Large windows in the mint green walls look out over the capitol city sprawling far below. A sign taped to one of the railings reads, This public transport pod is free to BOARD upon its arrival. A poster hanging on the northern wall shows the pod making a loop of the capitol planets as well as Empanda and Pax station.
