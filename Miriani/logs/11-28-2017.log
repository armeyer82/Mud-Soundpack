02:49 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:49 Kitty Mars asks you, "are you up for one load of atmo?"

02:49 You say, "Sure."

02:49 You stand up.

02:50 [Atmospheric Salvager Cockpit] (indoors) (sitting in the flight seat)
This small, cramped control area provides little room for movement. Directly in front of you is a control console and a small information display. The rest of the cockpit is taken up by windows. Outside, you see "Mischief" Vehicle Docking Bay.
You can go out.

02:50 You carefully pilot the vehicle into a small chamber above the docking bay.

02:50 The computer announces, "Vehicle catapult active. Prepare for extreme acceleration."

02:50 You are suddenly pressed against your seat as the vehicle is catapulted out of the docking bay.

02:50 The ship comes to a halt in the planet's atmosphere.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too
