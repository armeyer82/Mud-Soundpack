["Infinite Sunshine" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a hand-carved sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a yellow saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a pink clock, a comical poster of a cat with its head stuck in a fish bowl, an extra large poster featuring an angry looking cat wearing a Christmas sweater, a "Happy Holidays" banner, a small flat disc containing the image of a gargantuan multi-colored heavily rounded bloated sparkling shiny insectoid creature, and a large wooden frame that holds a colourful water painting of a group of dolphins playing in turquoise water that rolls gently over and around them hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the yellow tinted window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an 
00:24 internal stun turret, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a cherry wood trash bin, a translucent starship simulator, a hand-carved sofa, a glass coffee table with a yellow candle in the shape of a cat sitting on top of it, a pink leopard skin rocking chair, a hand-carved recliner, a pink leopard skin sofa, a pink leopard skin recliner, a hand-carved rocking chair, a blueberry bush, a blackberry bush, a strawberry bush, a tall antique gold lamp, and three translucent security drones here.
You see Kitty Mars (staring into space) (sitting on a hand-carved sofa) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

01:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:47 You notice Kitty Mars using the radio to request landing clearance.

01:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Infinite Sunshine. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:47 As the ship prepares to descend, an enormous wave can be seen forming in  the large ocean far below. Suddenly, a singsong female voice can be heard over the ships speakers. "Welcome to Griswold, the underwater tourist attraction."

01:47 Down below, distant beaches disappear over the curve of the planet's horizon as the ship descends into the dark blue water.

01:47 Waves surround the ship as it descends into the water. The ship lands with a wet thud upon the white sand of an underwater overlook.

01:52 [Griswold; Underwater Landing Overlook] (outdoors) (aquatic environment)
This is an enormous overlook. Underfoot is a thick layer of fine white sand. The overlook is lined with pointed boulders in lieu of a fence. The water is crystal clear and calm until a ship launches or lands which creates murky patches and heavy currents. The sun beats down strongly here, warming the water to a barely tolerable temperature. A contraption hovers over the sandy floor which cleanses the water of sediment created by starships. Narrow gaps between the boulders offer views of the planet below in all directions. A large stone cavern is off to the south acting as a starship garage. There is a wide slope lined with colorful round stones that leads deeper underwater to the east. To the west, a jagged looking wall makes a sheer drop down to the sea floor far below.

01:57 This adult Bottlenose dolphin is grey varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside. It is around seven feet long. It has an elongated head which gives it the appearance of a bottle. Though its functioning nose is the blowhole on top of its head. The nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open. There is an eye on either side of the bottle-shaped head, each with a horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupil. Its flukes or tail lobes and dorsal fin are formed of dense connective tissue and do not contain bone or muscle. It propels itself by moving its flukes up and down. Its pectoral flippers at the sides of the body are for steering.

Sturdy little limbs crisscross throughout the tree's top, and palm-sized balls of yellow fruit hang from these in clusters. The fruits are neon yellow and are covered in sharp brown spikes. A brightly painted sign posted near the tree reads, "The Vennedar fruit is extremely painful to the touch, even through most protective gear. The fruit is used in a spiced mash popular in some regions. Great care must be taken when harvesting these fruits, and special equipment is used by local gatherers."

02:19 The dull yellow leaves of this plant intermingle with the seaweed growing along the path. The leaves are oblong with sharp points at either end. Tiny saw-like protrusions run the length of each leaf, creating a sharp, serrated edge. A sign driven into the sand near a cluster of the plants reads, "The serrated edging on the leaves of this plant are used as a defense mechanism against hungry squeemblers. A delicate, complex filtration system at the cellular level of this plant helps to clean silt and other contaminants out of the near-by water."

02:20 A clump of triangular flowers

02:20 These triangular flowers grow on tall, leafy stems. Five blooms sprout from the head of each stem, and the close-set petals form triangular layers which get progressively smaller towards the yellow center of each bloom. The petals on the flowers are dense, forming a solid triangular shape. A sign posted near one of the flowers reads, "Commonly called Arbata flowers, these triangular flowers are dried and used in a relaxing bedtime tea. They give off a sweet scent reminiscent of vanilla."

02:20 A bush covered with clusters of translucent white berries

02:20 Clusters of translucent white berries grow in small bunches on this green bush, similar to the conical bunching pattern found in grapes. The bush itself grows in an almost spherical shape, with it's short, broad leaves growing in very tight formation. The effect is to make an almost solid outer shell with the thick, waxy outer surface of leaves. The pale green leaves spread out around the berry clusters. A sign posted near the bush reads, The iceberries give off a scent similar to peppermint, but with a sharper tang to the nose. These berries hold up well in soap and perfume production, making them a popular crop on Griswold. Contrary to their name, iceberries prefer to grow in warm waters."

02:22 These thin curly vines creep and tangle along the base of the seaweed bordering the path. Deep red in color, each vine circles in a tight corkscrew and grows in a long strand. Thick brown stalks grow out of the sand from which the vines sprout. A low sign twined with vines around its base reads, "These creeper vines are an invasive species native to Griswold's waters. When cut, the vines are used as a binding to aid in genetic grafting of other plants. The corkscrew shape of the vines tighten when they are clipped and dried."

Clusters of bright orange berries sprout from each vine, the fruit hanging from thin stems. The blob-shaped berries are bumpy in texture and are about the size of a strawberry. A tall sign next to one of the vine clusters reads, "The Grisberry is a sweet berry commonly used in jellies and jams. A crust of crystalized salt grows on the berries when they are removed from a wet environment, so they must sit in a bath of sugar water or other liquid during preparation."

02:26 [Griswold; In a Cave Mouth] (indoors) (aquatic environment)
Many pieces of coral and algae cling to the cold, wet walls of this cave entrance. The rough and jagged walls are almost uncomfortably close together, barely allowing much room to turn around. Cool, clear water flows freely in and out of the cave bringing with it clumps of seaweed, bits of sand and other ocean debris. The walls are so jagged that they form a set of very rough but naturally made footholds that head back up to the cave mouth. Off to the east a slightly larger room is visible. Though slithers of bright light make its way into this area, the main light source comes from millions of tiny pebble-like objects that cling to every surface. They are so small it is impossible to see them individually. They appear to be pulsating and emanating a rather dim glow that is barely enough to see by. A faint vibration can be heard as these tiny glowing pebble-like creatures move over and around each other.

Many pieces of coral and algae cling to the cold, wet walls of this cramped cavern. The walls are rough and jagged. Cool, clear water flows freely in and out of the cave bringing with it clumps of seaweed, bits of sand and other ocean debris. The main light source comes from millions of tiny pebble-like objects that cling to every surface. They are so small it is impossible to see them individually. They appear to be pulsating and emanating a rather dim glow that is barely enough to see by. A faint vibration can be heard as these tiny glowing pebble-like creatures move over and around each other. The rough stone underfoot slopes upwards to the east, leading into what appears to be a narrow tunnel. The water is unable to make its way up the slope. It is pooling back towards the steps to the west, taking with it all debris.

This spacious rectangular room does not look like something that would normally be found inside a cave. Instead of the smooth stone underfoot there is now large yellow tiles. The walls and ceiling are entirely constructed from very thick glass. This gives a perfect view of the surrounding sandcastle and the ocean beyond it. A small desk sits in the center of the room with several computer terminals. An elderly lady sits behind the desk assisting those looking at renting an apartment and sending out notifications to those with overdue rent. What is unique about this room however, is the many pictures of the whalecroc. There is a holographic poster showing the life circle of a whalecroc from birth to death. There are yet more posters of whalecrocs hunting, playing and raising their young.

A small desk sits in the center of the room with several computer terminals. A young teenaged girl sits behind the desk. Instead of assisting those looking at renting an apartment however, she has her nose stuck in a book featuring the Jellopus.

Apartments
--------------------------------------------------
Apartments give you a private place to store your items, give you a place to hang out that's more interesting than a ship control room and allow you to be a little creative.
To get an apartment, you'll need to find an apartment complex. There's one on Rosario, one on Angelus, one on Aquatimis, one on Quazicol, one on Iclea, one on Acrylon, a few on Outreach, one on 51 Pegasi b, Desolo, Venus, and, for donators, one on Empanda. In an apartment complex, you can type MENU to get a list of apartments, buy a new apartment or pay overdue rent. You can only own one apartment at each apartment complex, and there is a limited number of apartments available at each one.
  Apartments:
When you first buy an apartment, a foyer will be created automatically for you and you will be escorted there. A key to your apartment will also be placed on the ground. Don't forget to get your key and put it on your keyring. If you somehow manage to misplace your key and find yourself locked out of your apartment, you can create a new key through the "make key" option in the menu.
In the future, you'll enter your apartment by typing ENTER <apartment number>. You can also just type ENTER, which will match to the first apartment you have a key for and bring you there.
You will start with a total of four potential rooms. One of these potential rooms is used by the foyer, so you have three
04:15  to work with. You can buy additional rooms through the "buy additional rooms" menu option when you type MENU or DESIGN in your apartment. The default cost is 10 million credits for each new room (5 million for donators).
You can only have one foyer, one living room, one kitchen, one dining room, one laundry room, one library and one hot tub room. You can have an unlimited amount of hallways, bedrooms and bathrooms, however. To build a new room, choose the "build new room" menu option and follow the prompts to choose a direction and room type.
In each room, you can set details such as floor type, wall type, wall colour and wallpaper. If you're a donator, you can also request a custom description by typing DESCRIBE, then entering a new description. These requests must be approved by a host before the room can be changed. Room titles changes can be requested by typing RENAME.
If you want to allow other people access to your apartments, you'll have to give them a key. Through the manage keys menu, you can get a list of who has every key in existence for that apartment, destroy a specific key or create a new one. If you want to allow others to modify your apartment, you can also add them as an owner from the "manage owners" menu.
  Destruction and finalization:
You will not be able to drop any objects in your room before the design has been finalized. Once the design has been finalized, the cost of buying new rooms for your
04:15  apartment doubles.
You can delete any room in your apartment at any time, unless it's the very last room in the apartment or the entrance. There are no consequences for doing this. Anyone and anything in the room at the time is moved to the nearest adjacent room. Items are also unbolted before they're moved.
At any point during the life of your apartment, you can elect to destroy it. Destroying it before it's finalized results in a refund of the cost of your rooms (though not the cost of rent), while destroying it after finalization results in no refund of any sort. Please think carefully about whether you really want to destroy your apartment.
  Rent:
Apartment complexes charge a monthly fee based on how many rooms your apartment has. The default cost is 1000 credits for every room you have. Typing MENU will tell you the rent at that specific facility. Donators pay no rent if they build their apartment on Empanda.
Rent is deducted automatically from the primary owner. If the primary owner does not have enough credits, it tries to deduct the rent from one of the additional owners instead. If nobody has enough credits to pay the rent, everyone is locked out of the apartment until overdue rent is paid.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

16:52 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:52 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

16:52 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:52 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

16:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:52 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:52 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:52 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:52 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:52 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:52 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:52 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:52 The sensors are unable to pinpoint the starship's current coordinates.

16:52 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:52 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:53 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

16:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

16:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:53 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:53 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

17:01 I don't understand that.

17:01 The computer reports the starship is headed for Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (7, 4, 3). The computer estimates approximately 4 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

17:01 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

17:01 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

17:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:01 The computer announces, "This vessel's local archive of the Galactic News has been updated with new material."

17:04 Down below, distant beaches disappear over the curve of the planet's horizon as the ship descends into the dark blue water.

17:04 Waves surround the ship as it descends into the water. The ship lands with a wet thud upon the white sand of an underwater overlook.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

18:55 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:55 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:55 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:55 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:55 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:55 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

18:55 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:55 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

18:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:56 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

18:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:56 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:56 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

18:56 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

20:53 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

20:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:53 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

20:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:53 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

20:53 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

21:06 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair here.
You can go south.

21:06 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

21:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

21:06 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

21:06 [Chatter] Arianna Artorius transmits, "Good evening all."

21:06 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

21:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:06 [Chatter] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Hi!"

21:07 [Chatter] Cody Meynoso transmits, "Hey hey, how are you."

21:07 [Chatter] Michael Johnson transmits, "Oh my, I had to go 6 sectors out just to find a roid."

21:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:07 [Chatter] Andreas Fierro transmits, "Hi hi Ari."

21:07 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:07 [Chatter] Shamaya Iazikiwe transmits, "Hello there."

21:07 [Chatter] Magan Trinity transmits, "Hi hi."

21:07 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:07 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

21:07 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:07 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:07 Select a ship:

21:07 [1] the two-person asteroid hauler "Super Haul"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:07 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:07 Invalid selection.

21:07 The ship must be in MANUAL mode.

21:07 The two-person asteroid hauler "Super Haul" has left the sector.

21:07 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

21:07 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:07 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

21:07 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:07 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

21:07 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

21:07 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:08 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:08 #$#soundpack_pong

21:08 [Chatter] Arianna Artorius chuckles and transmits, "Well, I'm glad people are happy to communicate today."

21:08 #$#soundpack social | chuckle | female

21:08 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:08 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:08 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

21:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:08 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:08 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

21:08 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

21:08 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

21:08 You should stand up first.
