00:00:08 You peer out...

00:00:09 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The advanced scout "Celtic Rose", the one-person cargo hauler "Golden Dawn", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:00:21 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:01:04 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Got like six or so pirates in orion."

00:01:14 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Mostly scouts."

00:01:19 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:01:20 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

00:01:21 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:01:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:01:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:01:26 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Ooh who is crewing."

00:01:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:01:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:01:28 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Crew to Earth?"

00:01:36 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "On my way."

00:01:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:01:40 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am interdicted."

00:01:51 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Land on a station if you can. We'll be right there."

00:02:10 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

00:02:10 [Enter `yes' or `no']

00:02:11 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

00:02:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:02:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:02:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:02:31 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:02:48 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "On our way."

00:02:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:03:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:03:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:03:07 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Stuff Of Legends". The organization has earned 200,341.50 credits.

00:03:08 The ship is already moving.

00:03:09 The ship is already moving.

00:03:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Enter your selection:

00:03:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:03:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:03:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

00:03:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:03:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:03:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:03:18 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: mq|gS[c4^a3MW^>Y2"N#)//6T4Br3U'LRq783@oW
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:03:19 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

00:03:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:03:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:03:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:03:24 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:03:24 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

00:03:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:03:25 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.
You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

00:03:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:03:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:03:28 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:03:29 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That as close."

00:03:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

00:03:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:03:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:03:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:03:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Got some more in here."

00:03:37 Via general sector communication, AEU Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2815 light-minutes per second from Galactic West and Very Slightly Up."

00:03:37 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

00:07:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:07:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:07:47 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:08:07 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

00:08:14 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:08:18 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo beautiful."

00:08:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Pretty sure that was the closest I came to losing my ship so far."

00:08:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "How's it going?"

00:08:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Howdy."

00:08:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have only just now seen the status of an avenger. I officially love that ship. Just sexy."

00:08:39 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Goin' good. Yourself?"

00:08:46 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey Melinda."

00:08:48 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Good here and I love my avenger."

00:08:57 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not much going on, just been messing with Morris today."

00:09:04 [General Communication] Katina Faye giggles.

00:09:13 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Messin' with Morris?"

00:09:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Isn't that personal?"

00:09:23 [General Communication] Katina Faye laughs.

00:09:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Heya Mel. And yes, that thing is gorgeous."

00:09:26 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Sounds it."

00:09:27 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "All you dirty minds."

00:09:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

00:09:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I do not have a dirty mind. I am so offended right now."

00:10:08 [General Communication] Rogue Romano snickers.

00:10:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "She's good at tellin stories."

00:10:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah snickers.

00:11:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My mind is beautiful, clean and pure. I can't help it if it creates completely fucked up and perverted things for me to say."

00:21:51 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Erm, 500 mil for a mega drill?"

00:22:22 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah."

00:22:23 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's nothign."

00:22:49 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I just barely have it."

00:23:35 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Man, what are you going to say when you have to pay for the mainframe?"

00:24:03 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'd prob scream."

00:24:47 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "How many mega drills do I need for this anyway?"

00:24:54 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Probably only two."

00:24:59 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can't buy more than two, I don't think."

00:25:35 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Well, can only afford one for now."

00:26:02 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They give pretty decent points."

00:26:39 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I bet. I'm just tryin' to calculate what I got. I might be able to get that last one after all."

00:28:55 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa chortles. "I have one unprocessed piece of ore."

00:29:06 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That has neve rhappened in my life."

00:29:11 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Ha."

00:30:26 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Morris, I definitely got some industry for that!"

00:30:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

00:30:56 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I do admit I actually did that site to test that out as much as anything else so you can have accurate info."

00:31:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I did revise that, by the way. But folks can check out who has the passenger ships cheaper on their own. No need to hold hands on everything."

00:31:13 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:31:13 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:31:19 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:31:19 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:31:20 You exit the ship.

00:31:20 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

00:31:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:31:22 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:31:23 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:31:23 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:31:24 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:31:24 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:31:25 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:31:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:31:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:31:30 The ship is already moving.

00:31:38 The ship is already moving.

00:31:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:31:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

00:31:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:46 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

00:31:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:48 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:49 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

00:31:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:53 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

00:31:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:56 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, I wasn't suggesting that you should go around and get the price quotes from the different locations, just state that what they see on Luna isn't what they might see at the other locations."

00:31:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:58 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

00:32:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

00:32:01 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

00:32:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:32:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They can figure that out if they wanna go to all the places."

00:32:34 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure!"

00:32:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:32:38 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:32:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:32:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:32:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, thanks for your help on that."

00:32:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:32:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:32:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:32:57 You scramble to your feet.

01:56:54 Top Performers: Shule Elemmire, Constantine Stone, and Lily Kaise.
The current Conquest period began 1 day, 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 2 seconds ago. The period will end in 2 days, 3 minutes, and 6 seconds.

01:56:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:56:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:57:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:57:09 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Good evening."

01:57:19 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "The rest of fringe space is clear, I will grab my fighter and take care of it."

01:58:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:58:32 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:58:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:58:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:58:39 [Tactical Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "What are we looking for?"

01:58:43 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Bari."

01:58:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:58:53 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:58:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:00:11 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:00:13 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:00:13 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:00:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:00:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:00:20 I don't understand that.

02:00:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:00:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:00:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:00:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:00:39 Your ship 'Starlight Express' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:00:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Providence Gate. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:00:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:00:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:00:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:00:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:00:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:00:54 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Providence Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:00:57 Via general sector communication, Providence Station transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

02:01:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:01:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Guindalen, if you don't have any felo. Just land for now. It's not a good idea to fly around without felo."

02:01:52 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

02:01:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:03:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:03:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can't, unfortunately. I'm about 16 lightyears away from alliance sectors."

02:03:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also if you fly into an area where there are spores from bari or spreaders, you could infest the Spaceport so until you have a little more knowledge and experience with this, please stay out of harms way."

02:03:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:03:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:03:05 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.

02:03:34 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Stuff Of Legends" has landed on the planet New Earth.

02:03:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:03:37 The starship is already moving.

02:03:37 The starship is already moving.

02:03:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Figures this would happen when we were outbound."

02:03:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:03:55 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:03:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah seems to be in Fringe areas I think?"

02:04:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:04:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:04:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, still want me to check AEU sectors then?"

02:04:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, go ahead."

02:04:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:04:16 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:04:18 I don't understand that.

02:04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

02:04:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:04:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:04:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:04:33 The ship is already moving.

02:04:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sorry bout that, gang."

02:04:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "There was one in League space, one in fringe space. I figure there might be one in AEU space."

02:04:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:04:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I could go with you but you've probably already launched?"

02:04:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No worries."

02:04:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

02:04:57 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

02:04:57 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:04:58 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:05:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok which?"

02:05:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:05:18 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:05:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm on the landing pad of NEw Earth."

02:05:28 You peer out...

02:05:28 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:05:31 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:05:31 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:05:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:05:32 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:05:33 You exit the ship.

02:05:33 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:05:46 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

02:05:56 The one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" touches down smoothly on the ground.

02:05:59 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

02:05:59 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent.

02:06:02 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

02:06:03 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:06:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I already grabbed some felo."

02:06:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But feel free to grab a couple more."

02:06:45 You notice a few automated robots begin to unload a storage pod from the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet".

02:06:46 Lily Kaise glides in from below.

02:06:46 The robots leave quickly, carrying a detached hull plate.

02:07:02 Lily Kaise says, "Okiss shule."

02:07:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Please power off your ship on the New Earth landing pad."

02:07:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:07:09 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:07:09 You laugh.

02:07:10 The reactionless drive of the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

02:07:11 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:07:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Sure thing."

02:07:25 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...pirates down time to get the pod and interdictors."

02:07:28 HOLD <player> - Take <player> into your group.

02:07:31 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

02:07:34 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:07:34 You can go up.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:07:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:07:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:07:37 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:07:37 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:07:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:07:39 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:07:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Make sure that all ships are powered down and garaged."

02:07:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:07:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:07:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:07:50 Lily Kaise says, "Ohl shule."

02:07:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "There was only one on the lp."

02:07:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:08:05 You ask, "What?"

02:08:08 Lily Kaise says, "Nothing."

02:08:10 You say, "Oh."

02:08:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:08:12 You laugh.

02:08:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Providence Gate. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:08:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:08:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:08:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:08:22 Lily Kaise says, "Gogo gogogogoogog."

02:08:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:21:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:21:10 You grin.

02:21:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:21:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:21:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:21:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:21:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:21:17 Lily Kaise asks, "So you going to announce AEU is clear or did I not hear?"

02:21:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:21:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:21:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:21:21 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:21:22 Lily Kaise grins.

02:21:24 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

02:21:25 You say, "I already announced."

02:21:27 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

02:21:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:21:29 You grin.

02:21:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:21:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:21:40 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:21:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:21:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:21:53 Lily shakes her head to get rid of the cobwebs.

02:21:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:21:55 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:22:00 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:22:01 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:22:01 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:22:03 You laugh.

02:22:13 Lily Kaise says, "Don't forget those guys in your hands."

02:22:16 Lily Kaise grins.

02:22:16 You nod.

02:22:20 You grin.

02:22:25 You say, "I'm going to go put them back."

02:22:28 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

02:22:30 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:22:31 I don't understand that.

02:22:31 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:22:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:22:50 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Shasta the big onyx soldier felo here.
You can go south and out.

02:22:56 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches south.

02:22:56 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire.
Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:23:01 >> Command Aborted <<

02:23:09 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:23:59 You scramble to your feet.

You can go up.

02:24:01 You peer up...

02:24:02 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:24:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:24:18 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:24:20 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:24:29 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:24:33 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:25:45 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll wait a bit Morris. If you need more, let me know."

02:25:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Dammit they got another one. These bari are tough."

02:26:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Glad I brought three over. How's the tug lookin Eve?"

02:26:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's got bari, but I'm just looking to see how bad."

02:26:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

02:26:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You at Old Earth?"

02:27:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah. But not landed. That would be insane."

02:27:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well I knew you wouldn't."

02:27:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:27:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:27:53 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:28:05 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:28:18 You say to Lily, "Thanks for your help."

02:28:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Just a hive left. Your felo are smashin' 'em."

02:29:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They're a good line. Some of these have been tough. Was one of my slightly smaller ones that the horde got a few minutes ago though."

02:29:08 Lily Kaise says, "Will be right back."

02:29:10 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:29:10 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:29:12 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:29:36 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Without charge to check more, all eaos sectors clear, didnt check the torus chain."

02:29:45 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

02:30:17 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Those station on Olivia Pearl, are they to transfer tritium?"

02:30:18 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Soon as Eve can land we can get that and the Accord and unclaimed if she's willin."

02:30:35 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That won't be for a bit yet. I found more."

02:30:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They basically scoop from the planet."

02:30:42 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

02:30:48 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ahh, thanks."

02:30:56 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

02:31:57 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

02:32:16 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Scanner doesn't report any spreaders."

02:32:44 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks Hakeem. I was gonna turn mine on and then it slipped my mind."

02:33:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:33:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

02:33:52 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:33:53 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:33:57 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:34:02 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:34:05 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:34:09 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:34:23 Lily looks at you with a very very sad expression in her eyes.

02:34:32 You say to Lily, "What's up?"

02:34:50 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "This makes me want to invest in savage bari killing felo."

02:34:57 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.

02:35:07 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:35:11 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Makes me want to own felo."

02:35:17 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Anything left to check?"

02:35:19 Lily Kaise says, "I just went to buy a coupy of 'The Seriousness of Bari' book for Guindalen and... I was so shocked and saddened to see that Liam has retired."

02:35:30 Lily Kaise says, "Buy a copy that is."

02:35:31 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Accord and Unclaimed possibly. Not sure what all you got."

02:35:39 "Really? Oh my gosh!" You frown.

02:35:42 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I will check accord."

02:35:59 You exclaim, "That is so sad!"

02:36:05 Lily looks into space and says ... yeah so very sad. I so admired Liam.

02:36:11 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:36:22 Shule puts a comforting arm around you.

02:36:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right. Things are finally clear now. So I'll land."

02:36:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

02:36:40 Lily Kaise asks, "I just don't quite understand that someone with as much going for himself would leave?"

02:36:52 You nod. "I don't know either."

02:36:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's one hell of a tough kitten."

02:36:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."

02:37:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "He went nuts on 'em."

02:37:11 Lily Kaise says, "I wondered why he wasn't around out the grade 80 area."

02:37:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:37:20 You nod.

02:37:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Good lil Felo."

02:37:24 Shule nods sadly.

02:38:05 Lily Kaise says, "It must be devistating for Nissi."

02:38:12 You nod. "I bet."

02:38:18 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hakeem did you do the tesla pipe?"

02:38:19 Lily Kaise says, "They were such a nice couple too."

02:38:23 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yes."

02:38:28 You say, "She didn't really show it out at the salvaging op place."

02:38:31 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any idea what hasn't been done?"

02:38:38 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but she was pretty quiet."

02:38:41 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Torus chain?"

02:39:08 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "And the one with the anomaly."

02:39:17 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. Eve just mentioned that one."

02:39:18 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:39:34 Shule caresses your back comfortingly.

02:39:41 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:40:12 Lily Kaise says, "All I can say is if you ever quite piloting, I probably would too Love. I would be so... utterly lost without you."

02:40:20 You say, "Awwww."

02:40:22 Lily Kaise says, "Quit that is."

02:40:23 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:40:27 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:40:50 You say to Lily, "Well, if you ever quit, the AEU would lose one of its finest pilots."

02:41:00 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mir cluster and Torus cluster are clear."

02:41:03 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I doubt they would miss me."

02:41:09 You say, "They would."

02:41:09 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

02:41:10 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think that's everything."

02:41:12 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Think that is all."

02:41:14 You say, "And I would too."

02:41:20 Lily Kaise says, "Maybe you would heh."

02:41:28 You say, "Oh, I know I would."

02:41:42 You say, "I don't know how long I'd stay after you quit."

02:42:14 Lily Kaise says, "Doubt the others would but it's ok. I'm not here to impress others."

02:42:17 You say to Lily, "I would miss you so so much."

02:42:18 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:42:21 You chuckle.

02:42:23 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:42:28 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:43:25 You say, "And I'm sure I haven't really impressed the other AEu pilots either or any of the other pilots for that matter."

02:43:42 Lily Kaise says, "Oh they like you."

02:44:26 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:44:32 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:44:47 You say, "I'm just so happy to be with you."

02:45:24 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:45:29 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:45:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Of course you do. You know you do. You feel it, deep inside."

02:46:03 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Seems not."

02:46:14 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I do."

02:46:17 Lily Kaise says, "Wow we already have over 27 billion in our regular fund."

02:46:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looks like my golden soldiers are dying out. Lots of black and red."

02:46:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "See? See?"

02:46:27 You grin.

02:46:32 You say, "Oh."

02:46:32 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Come to old earth."

02:46:34 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Hey Alex."

02:46:38 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I just need to get some of evenia's savage bari killers to go with it."

02:46:39 You say, "I need to finish my mining site."

02:46:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, if anyone has any soldiers they'd like to trade, let me know."

02:46:49 You ask, "Can we go back so I can finish it?"

02:46:57 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I do, going to old earth now."

02:46:58 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That's why I'm not worried if you contribute towards support of your cruiser. We need to spend our funds on something!"

02:47:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

02:47:04 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:47:09 You grin.

02:47:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I've got a ship that's like. Half golden hummers. And half gold soldiers. Don't even ask me how the fuck that happened."

02:47:28 You say to Lily, "Can we go back to Old Frontier processor so I can finish my mining site?"

02:47:31 [General Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "Hi."

02:47:50 Lily Kaise says, "Ifever the rare instance that we're low on credits, yeah. Otherwise, we're good to go for a good while even if we didn't earn anything."

02:47:58 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

02:48:01 You grin.

02:48:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eve I'd take a golden soldier or two off your hands."

02:48:04 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:48:11 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:48:12 You say to Lily, "Can we go back to Old Frontier processor so I can finish my mining site?"

02:48:13 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "That was hard watching that poor soldier felo die fighting the bari."

02:48:20 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

02:48:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:48:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know."

02:48:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll see how many I've got. If I've got a good balance, sure."

02:48:25 Lily Kaise says, "Sure."

02:48:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

02:48:33 You say, "Thanks."

02:48:35 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

02:48:36 Lily Kaise says, "I guess I'm being roped into this shite heh."

02:48:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:48:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:48:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:48:45 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:48:47 You laugh.

02:48:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:49:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:49:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:49:10 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I'm not m motivated to do much else!"

02:49:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:49:14 You grin.

02:49:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:49:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:50:52 You peer out...

02:50:52 
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The scout "White Eagle" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

04:35:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:35:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

04:35:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:35:24 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:35:24 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:35:29 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Hmm, a square egg?"

04:35:33 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux laughs.

04:35:39 You say to Lily Kaise, "I would have done it, but I didn't see the parts in Herding Cats."

04:35:46 Lily Kaise says to you, "Did you want to go with me? You don't need to but I can drop you on New Earth so you can get a ship?"

04:35:56 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I like square eggs."

04:36:00 You say, "I can go with you."

04:36:02 You grin.

04:36:04 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

04:36:09 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:36:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:36:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:36:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:36:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:36:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:36:17 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:36:17 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:36:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:36:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:36:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:36:22 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:36:23 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:36:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:36:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:36:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:36:28 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:36:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:36:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:36:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:36:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:36:33 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:36:36 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

04:36:37 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:36:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

04:36:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:36:41 You say, "I didn't see the parts in Herding Cats."

04:36:49 Lily Kaise says, "They're not there."

04:36:53 You say, "Oh."

04:36:56 You say, "That'd be why."

04:37:00 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't put anything aboard."

04:37:01 You chuckle.

04:37:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:37:13 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:37:18 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

04:37:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:37:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:37:30 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:37:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:37:32 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:37:34 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:45:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Absolutely!"

04:45:31 Lily Kaise keys her metachannel FTL communicator:

04:45:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:45:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

04:45:41 You say, "They're out there."

04:45:48 You say, "Erm, up there."

04:45:51 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

04:45:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That extra 20 units makes a difference!"

04:45:55 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:45:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:45:58 Lily Kaise says, "Thanks."

04:46:02 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:46:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's actually 20%, not 20 units."

04:46:06 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:46:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:46:17 Lily Kaise says, "I wish I would have known earlier tough."

04:46:23 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:46:28 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

04:46:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:46:33 You say, "Sorry, my fault. I just remembered."

04:46:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:46:40 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:46:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris (nearest).

04:46:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:46:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:46:56 Lily Kaise activates the expert salvage electromagnetic manipulator and begins scanning for debris.

04:47:01 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

04:47:03 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a message beacon module.

04:47:04 There is no more nearby debris.

04:47:22 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok, it's all here."

04:47:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:47:28 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

04:47:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:47:40 Lily Kaise glides in from above.

04:47:44 Lily Kaise says, "So."

04:47:50 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:47:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am about twenty industry from a star class gunship."

04:48:20 Lily Kaise says, "'for the 777 beacon, we'll use the message beacon, a stealth, a passive, large battery and a core."

04:48:38 You say, "Ok."

04:48:50 Lily Kaise says, "Attach to last core."

04:48:54 You say, "Ok."

04:49:02 You remove a length of power feed cable from a leather briefcase.

04:49:05 Lily Kaise says, "And use the last beacon."

04:49:07 You remove a can of meadow-scented air freshener from a leather briefcase.

04:49:12 I don't understand that ("can" is an ambiguous name).

04:49:17 You put a can of meadow-scented air freshener in a leather briefcase.

04:49:18 Lily Kaise absently sniffs at the air.

04:52:09 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

04:52:09 [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:52:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:52:10 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

04:52:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Thank you lily."

04:52:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:52:33 Lily Kaise glides in from above.

04:52:39 This must be done in a weightless environment. Please open the bay door while in space.

04:52:44 Lily Kaise glides up.

04:52:48 A small light near the massive bay door blinks for a few seconds, then the door begins to slowly rumble open. You grab onto a handhold as atmosphere rushes out of the bay.

04:52:53 Lily Kaise flies in from above.

04:52:54 You brace yourself against a passive sector beacon module (contributed by Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys), then push it toward a temporary space station core module (contributed by Space Explorers Amidst The Stars) until it locks into place.

04:52:54 (20 seconds roundtime.)

04:54:21 This is a completed temporary station ready for launch. (You may USE it when the ship is in space to launch the station.)

04:54:28 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

04:54:28 Lily Kaise says, "Yay done."

04:54:34 You grin.

04:54:46 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

04:54:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "But now we have to trek out there. I hope I can stay awake!"

04:54:50 Lily Kaise glides up.

04:54:54 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Main Deck]

04:54:54 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

04:54:54 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

04:54:54 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, an early warning space defense device, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:54:55 Lily Kaise presses a button marked MODULE BAY DOOR.

04:54:55 A low vibration runs through the starship as the module bay door closes.

04:55:05 You say, "If not, I can deploy it."

04:55:05 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Shule Elemmire say, "If not, I can deploy it."

04:55:09 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

04:55:09 [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:55:10 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

04:55:17 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

04:55:17 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:55:23 Lily Kaise says to you, "Hmm?"

04:55:34 You say, "If you can't stay awake, I can deploy it."

04:55:38 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

04:55:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:55:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:55:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

04:55:49 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:55:49 Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

04:55:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:55:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:55:52 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.
Lily Kaise stands up.

04:55:54 You say to Lily, "Then I'll carry you to bed."

04:55:55 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."

04:55:57 You're already sitting.

04:55:59 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:56:26 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

04:56:26 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 145.0, 5.0.

04:56:31 You say, "We can't jump there without the beacon."

04:56:33 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

04:56:33 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:56:42 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:56:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:56:43 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:56:43 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:56:44 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:56:47 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:56:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:56:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:57:49 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

04:57:53 Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

04:57:53 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:58:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:58:55 You ask, "There's no beacon for 776 either?"

04:58:59 Listen. You need to be careful.

04:59:00 Lily Kaise says, "Wow 776 is gone too."

04:59:04 You say, "Ouch."

04:59:13 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:04:17 Lily Kaise grins.

05:04:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:04:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:04:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

05:04:24 You say, "It happens."

05:04:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:04:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:04:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:04:28 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:04:29 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

05:04:30 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:04:31 Lily Kaise picks up a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

05:04:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:04:45 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:04:47 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:04:48 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

05:04:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

05:04:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:05:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:05:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

05:05:26 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

05:05:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:05:35 You're already standing.

05:05:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:05:46 Lily Kaise says, "I'm going to go sleep Love, I don't want to stay up much longer."

05:05:50 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

05:05:50 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:05:50 You say, "Ok."

05:06:22 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:06:24 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

05:06:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

05:06:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

05:06:37 Lily Kaise says to you, "We can go to frontier though if you want."

05:06:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

05:06:47 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

05:06:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:06:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:06:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

05:06:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.

10:16:49 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

10:16:50 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

10:16:50 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

10:16:52 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

10:16:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:16:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:16:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:16:59 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

10:16:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:17:08 The ship is already moving.

10:17:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:17:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:17:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:17:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

10:17:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:17:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:17:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:17:19 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

10:17:22 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."

10:17:27 There are no other ships in the sector.

10:17:38 You quickly turn a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

10:17:38 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 145.0, 5.0.

10:17:48 You flip a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then push a heavy lever forward.

10:17:48 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:17:58 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

10:17:58 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

10:17:59 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

10:18:01 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

10:19:21 You press a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

10:19:21 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

10:19:25 This location is not connected to the FTL beacon network.

10:20:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

10:20:05 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:51:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:52:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:52:02 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

10:52:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:52:02 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

10:52:18 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

10:52:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

10:52:20 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Firestorm. Welcome to Accord space."

10:52:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

10:52:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:52:45 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

10:52:49 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

10:52:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

10:53:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

10:53:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:53:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

10:53:16 You scramble to your feet.

10:53:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

10:53:16 You exit the ship.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

10:53:18 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]

10:53:18 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

10:53:19 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

10:53:19 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

10:53:20 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

10:53:21 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:53:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:53:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:53:28 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

10:53:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:53:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:53:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:53:39 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

10:53:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

10:53:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

10:53:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:53:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:53:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:53:46 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

10:53:49 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."

10:54:02 You quickly turn a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

10:54:02 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 145.0, 5.0.

10:54:14 You flip a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then push a heavy lever forward.

10:54:14 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:54:24 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

10:54:24 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

10:54:25 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

10:54:27 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

12:01:43 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:03:30 You flip a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then push a heavy lever forward.

12:03:30 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

12:03:40 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:03:40 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:03:40 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:03:47 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

12:03:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

Thanks to Starseekers, we now have rift inserters up to go to 777. This means that for those of you who can't get rift drives, or don't have them on your transports, you can now get here without it being overly complicated.
To get there, jump to Mir and then travel to 777. There is a small toll on the way out, but it's very affordable.
For those who don't know, 777 is full of low to mid grade shipwrecks, and local artifacts, so it's a great way to knock out both industry and that first bit of exploration!

On behalf of SEAS, we want to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to Starseekers for contributing the Rift Inserters. I know newer pilots will now have another alternative to slogging for artifacts which are not as frequent in a few places. Although we have no new AEU pilots currently, our choice would only have been battle of Mir as we are unable to collect and research Fringe Artifacts. Happy hunting and salvaging!

12:22:26 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:22:26 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:22:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

12:22:29 The starship has left a unique area of space.

12:53:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not exactly. It's like...We leave from point A. and because of that beacon. we can locate point B."

12:53:46 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

12:53:50 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

12:54:06 [General Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I see. And if the beacon was not there?"

12:54:12 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:54:12 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

12:54:15 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

12:55:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah. It doesn't make us anything, but they're useful and they don't cost that much really."

12:55:13 The starship transitions into another sector.

12:55:16 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

12:55:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:55:17 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

12:55:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:55:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:55:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:55:30 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

12:55:32 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:55:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:55:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:55:35 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Jump sequence aborted."
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Providence Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:55:53 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:55:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

12:55:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:55:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:55:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:55:58 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:56:01 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

12:56:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not really. The organizations can afford them. And they aren't for profit. They're to make a pilot's life just that bit easier."

12:56:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:56:29 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The beacon itself doesn't, but there are other temp stations in the same place that do generate profit if used."

12:56:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, it helps us get points and profits by making that area easier for us to get to to salvage and artifact."

12:56:34 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

12:56:35 The starship is already moving.

12:56:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:56:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Also what they said."

12:57:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:57:01 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:57:06 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

12:57:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

12:57:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So by spending a little, we gain more than we spent. If that makes sense?"

12:57:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

12:57:45 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:57:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:57:47 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:57:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:57:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:57:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:57:55 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

12:57:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:57:58 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:57:59 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

12:58:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:58:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:58:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:58:26 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

12:58:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:58:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:58:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:58:30 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

12:59:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:59:29 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:59:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:59:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:59:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:59:45 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:59:45 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:40:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:40:57 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

13:41:00 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

13:41:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:41:41 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:41:41 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Hello."

13:41:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:41:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:41:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:41:58 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

13:41:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:42:21 Lily Kaise glides out.

13:42:23 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

13:43:16 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

13:43:43 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "So I went through the combat log, and after one hit from a torped I went from 97% failsafe and 45% hull, to no failsafe and 96% hull. Is that supposed to happen on a normal beacon?"

13:44:41 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "It can happen. Your hull only has 99 damage points."

13:46:41 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Ohh."

13:47:16 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

13:50:16 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

13:51:16 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rubs up against a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, purring softly.

13:54:36 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "2 for wing beacons?"

13:54:55 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If I can gun."

13:55:06 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Sure, one more."

13:55:16 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

13:56:54 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I'll join for one."

13:58:01 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Chetumal I'm guessing."

14:00:16 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.

14:03:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

14:16:16 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

14:18:16 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

14:20:16 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

14:22:16 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

14:23:16 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

14:27:16 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

14:30:16 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

14:30:56 You scramble to your feet.

14:30:57 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

17:17:12 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

17:17:12 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not it."

17:17:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn you."

17:17:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not it."

17:17:27 [General Communication] Cadet Sawyer Reid transmits, "Octarine."

17:17:37 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hmmm, nope."

17:17:38 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Melinda is awesome?"

17:17:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Huggy Pug."

17:17:43 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Profit."

17:17:56 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's a color."

17:18:04 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Indigo."

17:18:08 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Bingo."

17:18:09 [General Communication] Cadet Sawyer Reid transmits, "Aubergine."

17:18:14 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Blue."

17:18:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Chet lounge."

17:18:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Goss wins, I shall go work."

17:18:22 [General Communication] Cadet Sawyer Reid transmits, "Good job."

17:18:27 [General Communication] Alko Delovega laughs.

17:18:35 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I will document that in here!"

17:18:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

17:19:12 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Next time please only call me when you don't have something dumb to say please and thanks."

17:19:17 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Are you sure you want to indigo work."

17:19:23 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'll never call you again then."

17:19:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I ain't too good at that. I've usually got somethin good to say."

17:19:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...somethin dumb to say I mean."

17:19:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Freudian slip."

17:21:27 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I guess my pun was not that funny but I tried."

17:21:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My jokes fall flat all the time Vern."

17:22:22 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

17:23:55 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Do you want to indigo work? That was my best pun so far I thought."

17:23:58 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh well."

17:24:01 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:24:12 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Indideed she did."

17:24:54 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well thanks for the laugh Melinda."

17:25:03 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They can not all be zingers though."

17:38:37 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "How to tell you have salvaged too much."

17:38:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Your name is Vernos Bailey."

17:39:00 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Upon firing that first grapple, you have salvaged too much."

17:39:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."

17:39:09 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You start to forget what meter you are on the chunk."

17:40:58 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah just totally forgot what part of the chunk I was trying to grapple."

17:41:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Start at the other end at that point."

17:41:36 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It is all starting to blend together."

17:41:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Stop salvaging."

17:42:22 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

17:43:09 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Must reach goal."

17:46:22 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

17:48:36 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Why would anyone want thigh high boots?"

17:48:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They enjoy chafing?"

17:52:22 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

17:53:40 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person mass production scythe "Cleopatra".

17:54:22 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Stuff Of Legends". The organization has earned 301,454.79 credits.

18:03:04 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thanks for the assist lasat night Morris."

18:03:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing Eli."

18:03:44 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Figured it was either you, or the best auto-lander ever took me all the way to New Earth."

18:03:45 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Question. How long does GMG normally take?"

18:03:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

18:04:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You mean to get there Nathaniel?"

18:04:28 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "To get there, depends. To go through the stations, depends on you, your partners and how much of the station you want to cover."

18:04:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, for everything...it depends."

18:04:45 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Thanks."

18:05:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anywhere from a couple hours to a month."

18:05:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "When Ali and I run round and do the basics, we'll be in there about 10 minutes."

18:05:19 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

18:05:44 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I prefer the month idea."

18:05:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That'd be I think Keegan and Bryan?"

18:06:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ali and I can get through a site in 3 or 4 minutes. Finding them sometimes takes seconds or 5 or 10 minutes. Getting there anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and a half...coming back the same."

18:07:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So it really is quite variable."

18:08:20 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All of the mining sites are starting. I am proud of you, fellow miners."

18:08:22 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

18:09:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

18:11:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah... maybe someday we can get another Asteroid Cluster like what League and others have."

18:11:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only league."

18:11:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one else has something similar to Crias."

18:11:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh thought Fringe did."

18:11:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We should work on getting the arrow back."

18:11:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So we can be Masters of exploration."

18:12:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, barnham's is beta, just like frontier. It might be beta-5 instead of beta-4, but it's beta."

18:13:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Is space safe currently? I'm hearing a lot of league movement."

18:13:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Huh?"

18:13:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We're not currently at war with the league, so space is perfectly safe."

18:14:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, as safe as it can be with pirates, Outsiders, IFS, Bari, and who knows whatever else is out there."

18:14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You're probably just observing other vessels just doing their day to day work."

18:14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "10 4. Forgive me, I am used to keeping an eye on those who pat you on the back. They are the ones most likely to place the knife."

18:14:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah... hold that thought."

18:14:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm, I like this cadet. She's not very trusting. It's a fantastic trait."

18:14:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I totally agree with you Ather."

18:15:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I don't trust folks but I keep my potiental enemies close."

18:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And I do not say that with a single ounce of sarcasm cause well, I'm not lal that trusting either!"

18:15:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't tell all of my secrets to the most gabby and devisive other alliance pilots either."

18:16:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "My fater and mother were politicians. It's something they taught me. Take what you can, give nothing back."

18:16:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hey! Do they know Mr. Best?"

18:17:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Don't think so... if He's a pilot, probably not... Both planet dwellers."

18:17:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Our current president!"

18:17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Keep your enemies close, and your friends closer. They are more likely the ones to stab you in the back."

18:18:36 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hey all."

18:18:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well don't believe the majority of what other alliance pilots tell you or tell you to do and if you use your own judgement, rather than what they tell you to do, you're better off."

18:18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am nice but I also keep my suroundings in mind."

18:19:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

18:19:08 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "How is everyone doing, good I do hope."

18:19:30 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep, doing good."

18:19:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Just as in the propaganda they relate about us. I can tell you about many issues which they love to sweep under the rug."

18:20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh. No. *ggiggle*. Sorry, I'm just about waking up. I met Warren Garner twice at dinner parties, they worked alongside the campaign to try and settle my city down a bit... I say my city, it's not mine but..."

18:20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup."

18:21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "My family were huge Garner supporters until not too long ago obviously."

18:21:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Your family?"

18:22:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The other alliance civilian pilots seem a bit on edge that the AEU is growing again."

18:24:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "In the politest way possible. Tough luck? Not our problem if they can't stabilise cities into a populus of well-trained pilots?"

18:25:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay, the civilian pilot corps of the AEU has made huge mistakes in the past. It is time to move on from that, Not forget but move on and learn from."

18:26:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Vernos so have many others and yes we do need to move on but remember what we've learned from others mistakes and inappropriate behavior."

18:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What kind of mistakes has the corps made?"

18:27:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I read something about slave trading."

18:28:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Ones that have cost us too much money."

18:28:22 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

18:28:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well it's probably not a good idea to have that discussion here but read up on the news and history."

18:28:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We can not bring that up every time they bring our mistakes up though. We own ours."

18:29:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok i'll jsut mention one name and that is Dennis Feldman. Do any of you know who that pilot is?"

18:30:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I read something about it, but I don't remember what."

18:30:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh huh the silence is deffening."

18:30:22 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

18:31:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "He is a league pilot and is still at large. He was the one who lead the Slavers and he ran. I would be surprised if he were to be found that the League would do more than slap him on the wrist."

18:31:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Like I said, own our mistakes, don't bring up theirs everytime as a defense."

18:31:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Because if we bring theirs up they will just go, we are making excuses."

18:32:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes Vernos but you need not to talk so negatively concerning your own Alliance in public either. That just adds fuel to their stupidity."

18:32:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That is why you say yes, we own that and then you move on."

18:34:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You don't need to Vernos but don't lead in with so much negativity towards your own Alliance. I mean Vernos if you chose to become a pilot, then it just seems contradictory that you would want to be so negative."

18:34:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am not talking bad about my alliance by saying we own our mistakes."

18:35:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We have but you need not to dwell upon them and go forward. We must build up our ranks and work as a team to improve our image."

18:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That is what I am saying."

18:35:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok that's not how it comes across though."

18:36:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ather, care to chime in?"

18:36:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I feel like I am in the middle of a circlejerk here."

18:37:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Huh wait what."

18:37:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What am I chiming into?"

18:37:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "...oh."

18:37:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah Ather you're not a puppet."

18:38:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We own our mistakes, we move on, we learn from them and I do not think telling another alliance's pilots that instead of brining up their mistakes is talking negitive about the AEU."

18:38:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It is if you keep bringing it up."

18:40:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I think Vernos only brought it up originally to offer a reason that other alliance might be intimidated by our surge in numbers."

18:40:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think what she's saying, is it's best to leave it in the best to be forgotten. We've learned what we can from it and it's time for it to be behind us heh."

18:40:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though Lily, I do think you have a point."

18:40:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For the same reason, even."

18:40:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We'll chat sometime Constantine."

18:40:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "With all the new cadets we shouldn't be talking bad about ourselves."

18:40:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hehtran 1AEU! AEU! AEU!"

18:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "On one hand, I definitely understand where Vernos is coming from. He is taking the diplomatic standpoint which is perfectly acceptible and logical. I don't really see him being too negative towards the alliance with what he's doing and/or saying. I said pretty much the same in my interview; we all have mistakes that we've made. However, ours are more recent, and were a bit more newsworthy. However, Lily also does have a point in that sometimes it does start to get kind of annoying when the other alliances talk about us as if we're the only ones who have ever made monumental mistakes. The League especially, since they still haven't caught their own pilot who was responsible for that end of the slave trades, but enjoy badmouthing us whenever they have the opportunity to do so."

18:41:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That is precisely what I mean. You don't hear the other pilots bringing up their past transgressions very often either yet they do have them trust me."

18:42:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I feel it is prudent to note, profit and progress is not made by a band of merry gangsters. Progress brings profit, and profit serves us all. Dwell not on the mistakes on the past, instead, look to the future for what we can ssee in space. Are we not AEU members? Do we not serve a common cause? Should we not be filling our pockets and living the life, rather than dwelling on the mistakes of others? Come, my fellow pilots, let us move on from this topic and talk about lighter things."

18:42:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "One thing that always bothers me about the slver thing, is that it's made to be so sinister. Everything I read about it and remember shows that it was incompetance at worst."

18:42:22 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

18:42:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yes which is why when they do, you nod, you move forward and in your mind and not out of your mouth you go...you have made mistakes too."

18:42:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "What in the world is residentual structure?"

18:42:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This isn't a situation of "I'm right and you're wrong." We all have our different approaches of handling it. The...oh, the residential structure is a place you can rent apartments at!"

18:43:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Creative."

18:43:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "True Ather."

18:43:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are lots of places you can actually do that though, you might enjoy renting yours on New Earth."

18:43:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Vernos nobody is denying anything here. I'm just suggesting that we need to behave in a more positive manner when we interact with others."

18:43:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am sorry if this started to sound like I was saying I am the only one correct."

18:43:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I ehard that undergroudn building is quite lovely, though I never been in there myself. I have a house."

18:44:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm actually working on trying to get one built on Hyperion, although not sure how that's going to go."

18:44:09 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Ather..."

18:44:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But I'm sure folks would love to have a lovely view of hte Sea of Grass from their apartment."

18:44:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh I have one of those underground shelters. I'd prefer a beach cottagge. It's too far away from sunshine."

18:44:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I heard you mention that yesterday, Eli."

18:44:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I am actually rather comfortable in mmy flitter. I fear I need to buy some out and about clothes though, such as dressses? I did not find anything that I liked on new earth in new phoenix."

18:44:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Cottage."

18:44:32 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes, yes, I got it. I have to handle a few things in about 15 minutes."

18:44:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope you're able to do it."

18:44:44 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Meet me on new earth. We will talk until then."

18:45:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You might have better luck in manhattan."

18:45:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Haven't got a quote back yet, who knows what the expenses are, or even if Jacktown would allow it."

18:45:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh and lily I agree with you, we do need to behave in a more positive manner in public."

18:45:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh yes Katie you are very correct and you have an awesome perspective."

18:45:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I see. Is that on old earth."

18:45:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah."

18:46:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I already like you katie. You will shine."

18:46:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "But that positivity is not just words, its actions."

18:46:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I swung by just to see what she looked like, she's very... um... Well, homey? And I thank you, lilly. As my mother used to say, flattery will get you everywhere."

18:46:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

18:49:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "By the way Ather, that was well said, both here on comms and in that holovid interview."

18:51:56 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

18:53:26 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

18:53:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hate when I get lost in space salvaging."

18:54:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It can be annoying but just go by the security designations and you can find your way thre."

18:54:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "There."

18:54:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you are salvaging locally,  then a beacon locator might help as well."

18:54:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, amazing. I hadn't thought of that."

18:54:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I should get one of those."

18:55:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Or you could always use the eli method, and just use the rift drive to travel like five sectors."

18:55:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

18:55:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That sounds like my style."

18:55:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I've done that many times heh."

18:56:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

18:56:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I guess more folks probably have rift drives on their transports than they used to."

18:57:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "And on Asteroid Haulers as well."

18:57:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I obtain them for the majority of my starships except for Cargo Haulers and low level fighters."

18:58:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yo yo yo, I don't have tehm on my Clipper or Combat Scout."

18:58:23 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

19:04:23 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

19:04:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to wait and transfer my load as well?"

19:04:26 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

19:53:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral ro
19:53:14 cks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.

I am wanting to say thank you, to my family. Not the family I have left behind, and hope to soon find and help. But new family here. People who have helped me, who love me, who comfort me.

Family is not just blood. It is not unreg, it is not alliance. It is those who are there for you no matter what.

Thank you.

20:36:48 Lily Kaise says, "I am pleased though that Ather has at least offered to host some classes on combat."

20:36:52 You say, "Ather is more of the mindset that people should struggle on their own."

20:37:02 You say, "At least for a little while."

20:37:11 Lily Kaise says, "Which isn't totally right because this is how serious mistakes occur."

20:39:43 You say, "Erm about."

20:39:52 Lily Kaise nods.

20:40:50 You say, "League."

20:40:56 Lily Kaise says, "That's Ather for you but you could just share what you know and what you have found useful. Perhaps you might not be a total subject matter expert but you do know a lot and you certainly are qualified."

20:42:02 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh did you notice Alko moving a lot? Shouldnt he move and wait for lock more often?"

20:43:07 Lily Kaise says, "Well guess if he starts wondering about his low number of evasions, perhaps he will learn."

20:43:40 You say, "It's what tends to happen sometimes. People are successful just always moving and then fly cruiser and get hit a ton and wonder why."

21:40:33 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, we are meeting at chet in 5 minutes."

21:40:44 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

21:40:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh hey Eli!"

21:40:48 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "One step ahead of ya."

21:40:51 Lily Kaise picks up Lily Kaise's workbench.

21:40:55 Lily Kaise puts Lily Kaise's workbench in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

21:42:24 Eli Grey removes his virtual reality suit.

21:42:25 Eli Grey grins.

21:42:28 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

21:43:09 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "1 more."

21:43:18 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "For beacons."

21:44:00 Eli Grey retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.

21:45:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:47:55 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise has automatically contributed 3,706,300.57 AEU credits.

21:49:01 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "A Dime At A Time". The organization has earned 672,881.40 credits.

21:50:19 You smile at Lily Kaise.

21:50:22 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

21:50:32 [Old Frontier Processor; Asteroid Mining]

21:50:32 This room appears to be a control center from which one can control drone operations at remote mining sites. There appear to be several dents in the wall.
You see a large leather couch, a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go north.
(You are sitting on a large leather couch.)

21:50:34 Lily Kaise asks, "Ready to go do some major grave-robbing?"

21:50:55 You say to Lily, "You ready to go party at GMG?"

21:51:05 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I sure am!"

21:51:08 Lily Kaise stands up from a large leather couch.

21:51:08 You grin.

21:51:10 You stand up from a large leather couch.

21:51:20 Lily Kaise glides north.

21:51:22 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]

21:51:22 The scout "White Eagle", the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", and the one-person runabout "Grasshopper" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

21:51:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

21:51:25 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:51:26 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

21:51:26 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
You can go south and out.

21:51:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:51:35 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

21:51:37 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:51:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:51:45 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:51:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:51:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:51:54 You say, "I need to switch some minimods around and my suit."

21:52:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:52:01 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

21:52:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good luck with mining Eli, we're going to go shake up some graves."

21:52:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:52:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:52:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:52:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:52:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:52:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:52:14 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:52:15 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:52:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:52:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:52:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:52:19 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:52:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Happy hunting."

21:52:22 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

21:52:27 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:52:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

21:52:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:52:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you find a blueprint for a self replicating sofa machine, I'll buy it off of ya."

21:52:58 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

21:52:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Er I guess it's more like shak down haha."

21:53:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:53:04 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
Lily Kaise says, "Shake down."

21:53:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did I say sofa? I meant soda."

21:53:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:53:15 Lily Kaise keys her metachannel FTL communicator:

21:53:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

21:53:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:53:25 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on Lily Kaise's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.

21:53:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:53:25 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

21:53:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Something like that!"

21:53:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire laughs.

21:53:32 You kiss Lily Kaise.

21:53:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

21:53:33 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

21:53:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:53:40 You say to Lily, "I need to go get my suit ready."

21:53:44 You smile.

21:53:51 Lily Kaise says, "No problem I have to do a few things too."

21:53:54 You grin.

21:54:06 Lily Kaise says, "Then we'll go by accord and get parts for the charger."

21:54:10 You say, "Ok."

21:54:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 2,611,111.11 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person light escort "Intense Focus".

21:54:28 Lily Kaise glides south.

21:54:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

21:54:31 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:54:31 You exit the ship.

21:54:31 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

22:04:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:04:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:04:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:04:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:04:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:05:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:05:21 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 666" has jumped out of the sector.

22:05:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:05:36 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:05:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:05:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:05:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:13:06 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

22:13:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

22:16:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok yup our suits were loaded successfully."

22:16:37 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

22:16:40 You grin at Lily Kaise.

22:16:45 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

22:16:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:16:59 Lily Kaise says, "Ok off to get some pizzas and we'll be on our way."

22:17:04 You grin. "Ok."

22:17:07 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:17:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Star Of Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:17:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

22:17:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:17:26 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I forgot Magellan just a sec."

22:17:27 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

22:17:28 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:17:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Centauri Colony Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:17:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Colonial Gate."

22:17:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:17:33 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

22:17:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:17:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:17:35 Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial Gate station is now largely irrelevant, but still stands guard here as a sort of watchtower.
The computer says, "Jump sequence aborted."
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Outreach Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:17:38 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

22:17:38 Via general sector communication, Outreach Station transmits, "Greetings, Star Of Destiny! Welcome to Colonial Gate!"

22:17:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:17:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:17:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:17:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:17:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:17:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:17:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:17:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:17:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:17:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:17:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:17:56 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:17:59 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Star Of Destiny! Welcome to home space!"

22:18:02 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 666" has jumped into the sector.

22:18:04 Lily Kaise says, "Always something."

22:18:05 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 666! Welcome to home space!"

22:18:06 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:18:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

22:18:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:18:14 The computer reports that the three-person phantazein "Leather Rebel" has launched from New Earth.

22:18:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:18:15 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:18:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Star Of Destiny. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:18:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:18:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:18:34 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

22:18:34 Lily Kaise glides out.

22:18:35 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:18:35 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:49:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:49:52 Via general sector communication, Farport Station transmits, "Star Of Destiny, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

22:49:53 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok remind me to sotp off at Helios when we come back?"

22:49:57 You say, "Ok."

22:49:58 Lily Kaise says, "Please."

22:50:00 Lily Kaise grins.

22:50:09 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

22:50:11 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

22:50:12 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:50:20 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

22:50:39 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

22:50:40 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:50:42 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

22:50:42 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

22:50:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:50:43 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

22:50:46 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

22:50:52 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:50:55 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

22:50:55 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 299,406.94 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

22:50:55 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:51:05 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:51:05 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:51:07 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

22:51:15 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

22:51:32 Lily Kaise says, "Wow ot too bad."

22:51:34 Lily Kaise says, "Not."

22:57:45 You can't go that way.

22:57:46 You must be in space to send a general sector transmission.

22:57:48 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

22:57:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Daizey the humanoid service robot, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

22:58:24 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:58:35 You laugh.

22:58:37 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

22:58:37 A readout shows The Nebulous Tendril about 5.13 light-years toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Slightly Up.

22:59:09 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

22:59:14 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

22:59:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

Passive Long-Range Scan
--
No sensor signatures detected. A PING using the active long range scanner may reveal more, but is also likely to reveal your own ship's position.

23:11:29 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:11:30 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

23:11:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

23:11:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Charge-Maintaining Battery-Powered Broadcast Facility.

23:31:11 You peer up...

23:31:11 
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers & Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it here.
You can go south and down.

23:31:17 Lily Kaise asks, "You ready?"

23:31:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:31:23 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:31:23 You grin.

23:31:27 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

23:31:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:31:36 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

23:31:40 A launch trajectory is located.

23:31:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:31:43 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

23:31:43 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

23:31:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:31:53 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

23:31:53 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

23:32:03 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

23:32:03 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

23:32:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo!"

23:32:04 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:32:13 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

23:32:44 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

23:32:44 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 5.0.

23:33:03 The room grows a bit more chill.

23:33:14 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

23:33:14 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, -2.0.

23:33:16 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

23:33:16 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:33:22 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

23:33:26 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."
