-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
01:18:38 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:18:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:18:48 There appear to be about 26 pilots recently active.

01:36:22 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

01:39:59 [MTTS] Ulias: Is thre any explanation for why rafting two items takes the same amount of time as crafting 1? Just curious.

01:40:11 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh jeez I butchered the hell out of that sentence, sorry.

01:40:44 [MTTS] atherj: Well, roleplayably, I did have this explained to me once!

01:41:17 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:41:30 [MTTS] atherj: It takes time to gather the necessary supplies, and time to craft the item. When you're crafting multiple items, you've already got the supplies gathered, so it will take you what might seem less time to craft a batch of things.

01:41:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:42:13 [MTTS] atherj: Pretty sure that's how I had it explained to me, but a host can chime in if I got anything wrong.

01:42:54 [MTTS] Ulias: Hmm I'll accet that, sure.

01:42:57 [MTTS] Ulias: Er accept.

01:43:02 [MTTS] usfolks: So question, wouldn't this apply to robots as well? Or would that be that they are just programmed to gather the supplies as they need them?

01:43:48 [MTTS] atherj: Well, I mean, theoretically, you would think so especially since you do give the robots the number of items to craft. Mechanically though, the hosts probably wanted to give a disadvantage to robots grind-crafting a bunch of items for you. Sooooo.

01:44:08 [MTTS] atherj: This is purely a guess by the way. Disclaimer woo.

01:44:39 [MTTS] usfolks: Well, that's what I thought...was needing the disadvantage. But I was wondering if there was an ic reasoning...and hopefully I'm guessing at a decent one. heh.

01:44:54 [MTTS] atherj: Robots are dumb, I guess. They don't know enough.

01:45:28 [MTTS] atherj: Don't forget, our computers in the game world blow hardcore. The computers we hvae now outclass them by a pretty wide margin.

01:46:25 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, that's kind of why I was thinking that explanation would work. That they're literally programmed to do the same exact thing whether they need to craft 1 item or 1000.

03:16:59 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "I am actually losing an ability with the rental?"

03:17:18 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "I can't get group repair."

03:17:19 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Each suit has access to certain modules."

03:26:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Flash or flair? If you're seeing a flash, you might wanna stop flashing."

03:26:53 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

03:27:05 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Maybe that's why the riftflow is so unhappy."

03:27:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And if you start radiating...I would advise hiding."

03:27:53 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "But I can distract easily enough."

03:27:54 [General Communication] Ryo Stel snickers.

03:34:25 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Whatever. The rift likes my rack."

03:34:37 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "Yes, but, who will conquer you?"

03:34:54 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'm unconquerable baby. I'm like a rolling stone. I gather no moss."

03:41:20 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "See? I'm traveling way faster now."

03:41:36 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "All due to giving the riftflow a peak at my rack."

03:45:38 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:45:38 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

05:08:48 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Joel, haven't you been around long enough to know that if it's possible to get confused, someone will do it?"

05:08:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

05:09:06 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's why I waited for the other stations to have less than a day to do this."

05:09:17 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Man shit. You are right though."

05:09:29 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

05:10:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Anyone know if 290 is being used by anything else?"

05:10:10 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Nope."

05:10:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Um. It is not, that I can think of."

05:10:28 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Then this shit is going to be 290 for a couple of days."

05:10:29 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches south.

05:10:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Why not use 269?"

05:10:40 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

05:10:47 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Because I'd be tempted not to change it back."

05:11:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

05:11:37 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "There that might actually be a lil less confusing."

05:11:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm confused."

05:11:53 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Anyway. Send all hate mail to someone that gives a shit."

05:12:20 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I will send it to Morris."

05:12:25 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

05:12:36 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "He certainly cares about any and everything."

05:15:07 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Well shit."

05:15:15 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "What's up?"

05:15:25 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Looks like it's going to stay 297 for a couple of days."

05:16:02 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "At least this trip is only twenty minutes."

05:16:12 [General Communication] Hana Minami transmits, "Does-s-s-s anyone has the nuuuumber to Bg Tony's House of Wings-s-s-s?"

05:16:29 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Probably."

05:16:44 [General Communication] Hana Minami transmits, "Please?"

05:17:18 [General Communication] Hana Minami transmits, "Thanks."

05:17:40 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Are you going to eat wings while in a medical creche?"

05:17:49 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's hot."

05:17:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Kinky."

05:18:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You need someone to hold the dipping sauce for you?"

05:18:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Or provide it? I'm sure Joel would be happy to."

05:18:33 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Let's not get ahead of ourselves Evenia. That's for dessert."

05:19:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Why not a little for both parts of the meal? Don't be boring."

05:19:22 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Some people don't like mixing sweet with spicy."

05:21:29 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

05:22:37 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Nice cans on the SSN."

05:25:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

05:25:59 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Anyone up for some beacons in like fifteen minutes?"

05:26:09 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure."

05:26:15 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Nice."

05:26:29 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the south.

05:28:04 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 928,616.80 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

05:28:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Listen, you need to be careful."

05:39:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure."

05:39:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami
05:39:15 c felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact white refrigerator, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Xavier the old big silver soldier felo here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.)

05:39:18 You can't go that way.

05:39:19 You scramble to your feet.

05:39:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

05:39:20 You exit the ship.

05:39:20 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

05:39:24 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

05:39:24 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

05:39:25 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

05:39:26 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

05:39:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

05:39:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

05:39:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

05:39:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

05:39:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:39:35 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "How do I attend a beacon? What must I do?"

05:39:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:39:46 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Show up and most likely shoot things."

05:39:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

05:39:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:39:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

05:39:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:39:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Exactly."

05:39:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:39:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:39:58 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:39:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

05:40:03 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:40:06 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

05:40:26 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You have a destroyer Shule. I haven't replaced mine."

05:40:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:40:33 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

05:40:36 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I do."

05:40:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

05:40:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:40:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

05:40:53 You pull a large lever towards you.

05:40:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:40:53 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:41:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

05:41:14 You can go out and enter into the ship.

05:41:15 You exit the ship.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. 
13:12:56 If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
13:12:56 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 17 April 2317 GST. Time remaining: 3 days, 12 hours, 48 minutes, and 35 seconds

13:45:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:45:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:45:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:45:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:01:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:11:48 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:11:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:11:50 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

16:11:50 You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:11:52 You exit the ship.

16:12:25 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Checking it out in my mighty fighter!"

16:12:25 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Come to Earth."

16:12:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:12:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:12:35 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

16:12:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:12:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:12:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:12:41 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Need more people?"

16:12:41 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "On my way."

16:12:45 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yep."

16:12:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:12:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:12:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:12:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

16:12:54 [Tactical Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Do you need us to fly back as well?"

16:12:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:12:58 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Not now."

16:12:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:13:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:13:00 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:13:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

16:13:09 Via general sector communication, Koclar transmits a text-based transmission: "woo clipper"

16:13:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:13:16 The computer reports that the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

16:13:17 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "woo!"

16:13:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:13:20 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:13:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:13:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:13:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!". The organization has earned 1,977,881.81 credits.

16:13:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:13:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:13:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:13:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

16:13:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:13:36 You exit the ship.
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The Trucker rescue pod, the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar", the three-person clipper "Firestorm", and the three-person avenger "Kaplan" are landed here.

You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

16:13:37 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I'm heading toward Battle of Mir, but its going to take a bit to make it back there."

16:13:40 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.

16:13:42  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

16:13:42 You are carrying nothing.

16:13:47 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I think they all jumped out?"

16:13:48 Ali Candan takes you into his group.

16:13:56 The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

16:14:05 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

16:14:07 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:14:08 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

16:14:13 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

16:14:13 Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The Trucker rescue pod, the three-person avenger "Kaplan", and the scout "White Eagle" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
Ali Candan is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

16:14:18 The scout "White Eagle" touches down smoothly on the ground.

16:14:21 The reactionless drive of the scout "White Eagle" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

16:14:23 Kim Saunders exits from the scout "White Eagle".

16:14:26 You hug Kim Saunders.

16:14:26 Ali Candan takes Kim Saunders into his group.

16:14:30 You follow Ali Candan aboard the three-person avenger "Kaplan".

16:14:31 Ali Candan uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:14:33 Ali Candan says, "Let's chek it."

16:14:34 [Starship "Kaplan"; Weapons Room]

16:14:34 You can go down.

16:14:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:14:41 [Tactical Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "There is interdictors here."

16:14:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:14:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:14:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:14:51 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

16:17:08 You grin.

16:17:10 You peer south...

16:17:10 
[Starship "Kaplan"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a large leather chair here.
Kim Saunders is sitting on a large leather chair.
You can go north and down.

16:17:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:17:10 Ali Candan grins.

16:17:15 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:17:15 You wave.

16:17:17 You say, "See ya."

16:17:20 Ali Candan says into the PA microphone, "Thanks for comming guys."

16:17:20 Kim Saunders strides in from the south.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:17:28 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:17:28 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:17:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:17:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:17:47 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

16:17:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:17:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

16:17:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:18:11 There are no other ships in the sector.

16:18:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:18:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:18:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:18:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:18:18 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

16:18:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:19:00 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

16:19:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:19:02 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:19:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:19:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:19:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:47:36 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Yup same here. Just going to do some salvaging while we wait."

17:47:42 [MTTS] blindbat84: Might I say I approve of this new concept idea, since I've had af ew profiles rejected and I tend to erm, overdo my profile a bit whenI have to write one. I never resented the effort, but this is actually pretty cool and will save a lot of hard work before getting to the profile that will just help cement and detail that character concept.

17:47:59 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Anything going on? Need help?"

17:48:32 [MTTS] usfolks: I agree. Especially for new people that have never played before. Gives them a chance to get into it. I like the higher point caps too.

17:48:43 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Seems not."

17:48:50 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Any interest on beacons?"

17:50:06 [General Communication] Hana Minami transmits, "I will beacdon I guess."

17:51:22 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "I am not sure what happened to the last team I wnated in with. She is quiet. I am still interested in going on a few beacons."

17:51:33 [MTTS] blindbat84: Agreed. Man, I remember back in the day when the cap was twenty five points. This really does save on writing a huge long profile only to have the entire concept scrapped. I won't be rerolling any time soon to experience it myself, but I do rather love it.

17:51:34 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Chet, Josh."

17:51:48 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "It beats salvaging. Ok."

17:51:59 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah,  I think it's a brilliant change that will likely result in more new players sticking around longer.

17:52:16 [Tactical Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "You have room for one more?"

17:52:17 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, I think it would have saved me the mini breakdown I had when I misunderstood the response my my very first profile. Heh.

18:54:27 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:54:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The Trucker rescue pod and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

19:33:11 [Starship "It's A Wolf Thing"; Engineering Room]

19:33:11 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
Juliette Wesmyer is standing here.
You can go north and south.

19:33:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:33:17 Juliette Wesmyer

19:33:17 She appears to be 21 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has light brown skin. Her body is full-figured with wide hips and strong calves. She has sloping shoulders and large breasts. Her face is round and quite pretty, with a wide nose and round chin. Her lips are full and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and round. Her shoulder-length, very curly hair is midnight black and drawn back in pigtails. She has oval pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a standard grey shipsuit, a dark pink denim jacket with a gold 'XX' embroidered on the back, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a gaudy metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, and a bag that looks like a hollowed out human head. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a warm double chocolate chip cookie in her right hand, and a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades 2317 Edition" in her left hand.

19:33:18 The ship jerks sharply as its chainguns are fired.

19:33:19 The damage control computer reports, "Repair of the wormhole drive has been completed."

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:29:14 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Where do I rent a ship?"

21:30:18 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:30:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:30:20 There appear to be about 25 pilots recently active.

23:57:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:57:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:57:33 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

23:57:33 You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:57:33 You exit the ship.

23:57:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

23:57:38 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:57:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:57:40 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:57:42 Not much to see out there.

23:57:44 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:57:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:57:46 You peer out...

23:57:46 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.' A light dusting of mold spores is scattered across the landing area.
The Trucker rescue pod, the one-person cargo hauler "Salvager1", the one-person fighter "Danger", the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-94", the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-74", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southw
23:57:46 est, west, northwest, and down.

23:57:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:57:50 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

23:57:53 You glance at your communicator's screen.

23:57:53 There is one board post.

23:57:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:57:56 Old Earth Orbit (League) [Human Interalliance Space] (Security: Alpha-1)

23:57:56 Coordinate rundown:

Space Stations: (4, 11, 8)
Space Markets: (4, 5, 8)


23:58:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:58:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Earthgate. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:58:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:58:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

23:58:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:58:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:58:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:58:13 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Earthgate in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:58:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:58:48 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

23:58:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:59:30 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Old earth is infested."

23:59:47 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I saw mold spores on the lp."

23:59:50 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Fringe clear."

23:59:51 You can't go that way.

23:59:57 [Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]

23:59:57 You see a large leather chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.
