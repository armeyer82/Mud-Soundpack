Her shoulder-length, strawberry blonde hair is styled in a French braid with threads of silver holographic  light woven into it. She has almond-shaped brown eyes with an upturned nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to be covered in melting snow. She has a yellow stamp of the word, "Quack" on her forehead.

04:31 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

04:31 I don't understand that.

04:31 The ship is already moving.

04:31 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

04:31 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

04:31 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

04:32 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

04:32 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

04:32 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

04:32 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

04:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

04:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

04:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

04:32 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

04:32 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

04:32 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

04:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

04:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

04:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

04:32 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:32 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

04:35 I don't understand that.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy red carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

05:27 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

05:27 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

05:27 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

05:27 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

05:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

05:27 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

05:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

05:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

05:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

05:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

05:28 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

05:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:28 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:28 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:28 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:28 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

05:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

05:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

05:33 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, and a dark blue suede sofa here.

Droids
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Droids are humanoid robots that follow you around to do your bidding. Most models exist solely to protect you, but in addition to that they also possess the ability to store items and, most important of all, tell you the time and date.

  Commanding Droids:
To command a droid, you simply speak the droid's name followed by the command you wish to give. For example, to instruct your droid, Noodle, to follow you, you would type:

say Noodle, follow.

Or your favorite variation of the say command.

  Standard Droid Functions:

Add [person] - Add a person to the droids friends list.
Remove [person/clothing] - Remove the person from the droids friends list or removes the clothing specified.
Friends - List the droids friends.
Authorise [person] - Allow  to command the droid.
Deauthorise [person] - Remove  from droid command list.
Owners - Lists who can control the droid.
Get [item] - Attempts to pick up an item.
Drop [item] - Drops [item]
Give [item] to [person] - Gives [item] to [person]
Contents - Lists the droids contents.
Holding - Tells what the droid is holding without telling what it has stored.
Store [item] - Stores [item] in droids storage compartment.
Unstore [item] - Retrieves [item] from storage.
Wear [item] - Dons [item].
Follow - Follows you around. Or stops following you around.
Remote - Enables remote mode.
Charge - Causes the droid to announce its currently charge level.
Time/Date - Informs you of the time and date.
Put [key] on [keychain] - Places a key on a keychain if your droid is wearing one.
Keys - Tells you what keys your droid has on its keyring.
Invalidate - Unlinks the droid from its remote in the event that it gets lost. Standard replacement remotes can then be LINKed to the droid.
Disc - Loads or unloads a video disc to record your droid's camera output. To properly record, the droid's camera must be active and it must have recording enabled. EM pulses will disable the recording functionality and it must be re-enabled after the droid recovers.

05:45 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

05:45 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
(Amalthea; Landing Pad) You notice a dim glow begin to emanate from the windows of the one-person expediter "Dolphin" as it powers up.

05:45 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

05:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

05:45 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Amalthea; Landing Pad) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" rises smoothly off the ground and hovers for a brief moment before rapidly accelerating towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

05:45 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

05:45 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

05:45 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

05:45 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

05:45 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

05:45 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

05:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

05:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:45 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

05:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

05:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

05:46 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

05:46 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

09:55 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Amalthea; Landing Pad.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, and a dark blue suede sofa here.

10:57 You peer out and see...

10:57 [Amalthea; Landing Pad]
Towering mountains surround and embrace the valley where this landing pad rests, their peaks invisible far above. Caves of all sizes cut into the mountains, some natural, others appearing to be man made or at least modified. The landing pad itself is little more than a flat area of gravel, carefully cleared out to provide a safe place for landing.
You see the two-person asteroid hauler "Balthazar" powered down here.
You see a white claw machine encrusted with crystalline mineral deposits, Atheist the droid, a sapphire blue stuffed manatee, Hissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, and a blue sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, south, and up.

10:58 [Private | Anny Rain] Anny Rain transmits, "On the 15,13,20 and 11."

10:59 [Chatter] A Proboscis Monkey screams, "LIFE'S A SHOW AND WE ALL PLAY OUR PARTS, AND WHEN THE MUSIC STARTS, WE OPEN UP OUR HEARTS."

You can go south and out.

For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a gray armor storage bag, and an asteroid hauling kit.

12:39 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Amalthea; Landing Pad.

A: A house will come with a way to boot anyone out of the house, a biometric entrance where you can set the people you want able to come in, an optional pool, an optional hot tub, an optional private garage, and the ability to create the design of the house exactly as you'd like it and describe all the rooms yourself.

Q: How do I get a house?
A: Visit the realtor's office on Aquatimis in sector 10. From the office itself, type REQUEST. Your name will be placed in a queue and somebody will meet with you when time permits to create your house. When requesting your realtor, make sure you have information ready, such as what planet you would like your house on, where on
15:07  the planet you want it, and what you would like it called.

Q: I don't want my house to be at this location anymore. How can I get it moved?
A: For a fee of 1,000,000,000 credits, you can assist and have your house relocated. This fee is non-negociable. Think of it as having to break up your house into segments and send it by truck across country. Moving houses is a very tedious process, so in order to curb the constant requests to relocate, we had to impose a fee.

*** It is worth noting that if your house is built on a private structure, such as a space station, moon or planet that does not belong to you and the owner of the property denies you access, it is entirely an in character issue. Furthermore, if the property's owner is no longer in the game and another party purchases the property, it is not the responsibility or obligation of the hosts to move your house for you free of charge.

16:25 Miriam Valleris sashays up.

16:25 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:47 [Newbie] Ana Morales: Greetings... Sorry, is there a more faster way than just exploring to find a shop where I can buy lore computer? I'm on the needed planet and walking around like 15 minutes. Maybe it's wierd, but I'm totally... New here :( And still have to read a lot before trying to ask in character.

16:47 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Not a big deal,just in chatter ask could someone give you directions to the lore computer store on pluto?

16:47 [Newbie] Carrie Reid: Maybe shouldn't try to get a lore until you have about 15 million credits then.

16:48 [Newbie] Noah Navarro: Getting a Lore is one of the only places that doesn't allow you to map. Most other planets allow you to type MAP <destination> to get directions.

16:49 ["Fatal Destiny" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

17:09 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has launched from Rolukssica.

17:09 There are no ships here.

17:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

17:09 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:10 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:10 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:10 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:10 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:10 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has initiated an intrasector slip.

17:10 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:10 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

17:10 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:10 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:10 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:10 The ship needs to be in space to move.

17:10 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

17:21 ["Fatal Destiny" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

17:45 ["Fatal Destiny" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You can go north and down.

17:51 ["Fatal Destiny" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see Miriam Valleris (staring into space) here.

17:56 You ask, "Want to fly again?"

17:56 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "my food is cooking so after that i will eat. But I will be back fast" ]

17:56 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request launch clearance.

17:56 I don't understand that.

17:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:56 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has launched from Rolukssica.

17:56 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:56 Miriam Valleris inputs some coordinates into a navigational control console.

17:56 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.
The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:56 I don't understand that.

17:56 [ You shatter immersion and say, "Ok, no problem" ]

17:57 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:57 Miriam Valleris inputs a command into a small navigation console.

17:57 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:57 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:57 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:57 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

17:57 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:57 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

23:45 [General Communication] High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle transmits, "I would like to inform you all that at this time, stage six has been cleared by a large Krenelia force. The fleet numbers grew at an inordinately rapid pase, and High Guard is still looking into the capacity of the Praelor bezation starship, as it seems the ones we saw have grown. At the time of our departure, 390 Onati flew in stage 6, and only by establishing a temporary base in uncharted territory could the Krenelia recover their numbers and clear the stage in our stead. However, that still does not explain the immediate evacuation request I received, and the reason why you all have been waiting. Unfortunately, I cannot give many details, as I am not familiar with the device. However, the Krenelia have been developing, and today employed a cloaking generator which hid their preparations from the Ontanka force. It seems to have something to do with muddying the readings of long-range scanning equipment, and it evidently limits the Ontanka's sensors as well."
