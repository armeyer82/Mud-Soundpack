02:41 #$#soundpack_lag 95

02:41 You press a large button embossed with the stylized image of a mailbox.

02:41 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting for you at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Entryway.

02:41 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:41 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

02:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:41 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Awww, ok. Thanks. I'll go check my mail"

02:41 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:41 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

02:41 The eight-person gunship "Auribus Teneo Lupum" has jumped into the sector.

02:41 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:41 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:41 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:41 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:41 Current coordinates: 8, 10, 1

02:41 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:41 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:42 #$#soundpack_pong

02:42 #$#soundpack_lag 109

02:42 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:42 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

02:42 You can't go that way.

02:42 You can't go that way.

02:42 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:42 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

02:42 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:42 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

02:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

02:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:42 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

02:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:42 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:42 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:42 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Entryway.

02:42 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:42 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

03:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, and a slim blue medical drone here.
You can go south and out.

03:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

I am conceding to a duel because that's what you asked for.  You may feel free to hunt me with all the resources at your disposal, I really don't care.  I'm just a people pleaser at heart so I like making them happy.  Therefore we'll duel.  I certainly wouldn't be opposed to a retraction of your unfounded ravings and taradiddles on chatter about my apparent cowardess, but I'm looking for nothing other than to silence you at least momentarily, and to potentially keep you out of my affairs.  In addition to the short shrift I have already promised, I will bescumber your vessel in the most frightful and colorful way imaginable.  Good day.

15:03 Amore Carver
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This voluptuous woman appears to be in her early twenties and stands 5 feet and 3 inches tall with a large bust size. Her heart-shaped, classic-featured face bears a flawless creamy complexion. Her thick, mid-back length, honey blonde hair is styled into luxurious curls that flow down her back. She has expressive long curly lashes which accentuate her sultry blue-green eyes with a delicate straight nose above full lips and white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an Aggressive stance.
She has a crimson tattoo of a pitchfork wreathed in flames on her lower back.
She has a dangling alien crystal winged heart in her left earlobe, a dangling alien crystal winged heart in her right earlobe, and a delicate alien crystal winged heart in her navel. She is wearing light pink lipstick on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted pink with hearts and adorned with silver glitter and the nails on her right hand are painted pink with hearts and adorned with silver glitter.
For a top, she is wearing a low-cut midnight black halter silky alien fabric top tied just above the rib cage over a black silk strapless bra with a silver heart-shaped front clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a very short black leather miniskirt over a sheer black silk thong. She is wearing a pair of high heeled black leather thigh high boots that zip up the sides on he
15:03 r feet. She is wearing a delicate gold belly chain adorned with tiny dangling gold glass hearts around her waist. She is also wearing a delicate lady's sapphire and diamond ring, a pretty gold ring engraved with intertwining hearts, a gold ring with an elegant teardrop pink sapphire with tiny blue crystals surrounding it, a feminine gold band engraved with the words "forever AIE", a gold Commoveo membership ring, a beaded rose-gold bracelet with a tiny touch screen, an elegant rose gold digital wristwatch with a butterfly-shaped liquid crystal face, a rich ivory silk backpack with cream softly padded straps and a cream heart-shaped front pocket, a compact silver Lore computer, a glittery pink camera, a silver armor storage bag, a blue spacesuit storage bag, a black plastic artifact storage container, a white archaeological artifact storage container, a pink rolled toolkit, a black spacesuit jet, a level two archaeological dig site scanner, and an asteroid hauling kit.
She is carrying nothing.

18:21 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

18:21 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:21 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:21 [Short-range Communication] Meredeth Lancaster transmits, "Byyye."

18:21 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:21 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:21 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:21 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:21 [Short-range Communication] Erik Yobi transmits, "Dip it in the milk. Twirl it all around!"

18:21 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

18:22 #$#soundpack_pong

18:22 #$#soundpack_lag 104

18:22 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

18:22 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

18:22 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

18:22 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

18:22 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:22 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:22 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:53 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Does @artifacts count artifacts when you reearch them? If so, how does it count splitting containers?

20:53 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Research.

20:54 #$#soundpack_lag 109

20:54 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: Only counts when there researched. I'd assume there split amongst everyone when researched on the artifacts list.

20:54 [Newbie] Michael Calaway: I guess if you have 30 artifacts, and split between 3, each of you would get 10 towards your count.

20:54 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Okay. That's what I'd think. I just wasn't sure if that was taken into account.

20:54 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Would suck if you had an odd number though. Lol.
