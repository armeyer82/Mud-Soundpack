-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a high tech silver star print holovid, a small oval turquoise
rattan table with a glass top, a pair of tan suede clogs, and Kiska the humanoid
service robot here.
You can go out.

Subject: TO THE SPACE AQUARIUM!
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
Posted: 02:57 11 September 2316 GST
--
Greetings and salutations!
It has come to the attention of de Nouveau Quebec Ministère Du Xeno-Tourisme
that many new or less new pilotes did NOT have massive joy of excreting various
exciting bodily fluids in aquatic setting. This must be changed! I, Pierre-Louis
Tremblay-Du-Lys Du Nouveau Quebec, have decided to launch exciting journey to
change this. Also, is your chance to get a shell for your org thing and some
eggs. *
As such, I encourage all pilotes who have never went to aquarium to come,
provided they actually want to, because there is some duration to trip. Ones
that did go there already can also come, of course, as there is room for
everyone thanks to magic of the cryotubes, should there be too many people
aboard. Going into cryotubes will of course be entirely voluntary. **
All usual pets are welcome! Although I can't really help you with that twenty
ships full of felo back on planets. Please keep non-sterile felos there. ***
If you are interested, you can send me mail or just tell me through other means.
Number is in directory. Ship will be leaving around 2359 of the 24th of
September from Tandem. Just be at Bright's Bar around that time and you shall be
picked up. Should you be too shy to contact me, you could also just hang out at
the bar at that time and you have good chance to still be picked up, thanks to
crew expanding magic of cryotubes. Special accommodations might be possible, but
bringing a ship is not one of them. ****
*Purpose of journey is also to test certain capabilities of vessel and to see
behaviors (Including, but not limited to: resistance/generation of drama,
propensity to do dumb things, and maintaining of acceptable odor) of prospective
pilotes for further, more dangerous missions.
**Voluntarism may potentially be mandatory, Comrade.
***Base pets limit of 30 treated felos, 20 spiders, 15 dick lizards, 50 catbots,
5 medium-sized pebbles, 2 pigs, one cow (in cryo), 5 chickens, 6 turtles (medium
aquariums), 150 approved small xeno aquatic lifeforms, those creepy things from
Ixtapia, 15 spider bots, 20 humanoid robots, 30 hoverbots, one (1) flying
dragonfly bot, 5 colonies of ants, 12 birds of certain pre-approved species (in
sufficiently-sized cages), a reasonable amount of cleaning bots (various models)
Other pets may be accepted, contact for details and confirmation.
****Although crew manifest will be rather open and flexible, I reserve right to
refuse entry in ship, and thus journey, to anyone for both real and imaginary
reasons.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Centauri Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a small lavender trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Aerial fortresses can be stored and later retrieved from the aerial fortress
shop using the STORE and RETRIEVE commands. Perhaps this will be useful one day!
   Posted 5 days, 22 hours, 15 minutes, and 52 seconds ago
-----
Aftermarket upgrade shops will now actually let you retrieve the upgrades you
have stored! They will appear after the usual purchaseable upgrades in the
shop's menu when the ship they were originally taken from is present. Please
report any oddities or exploits, particularly things like being able to have two
upgrades which are normally incompatible.
   Posted 5 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes, and 6 seconds ago
-----
Owners of a ship can now clear the message boards of their ships with onboard
ship message boards at the shop that sells the onboard ship message board
upgrade.
   Posted 3 days, 19 hours, 11 minutes, and 59 seconds ago
-----
Ships are now no longer invisible just because they can't see anything.
   Posted 3 days, 18 hours, 57 minutes, and 30 seconds ago
-----
The game's main method of creating and destroying objects has been made faster.
Much faster.
