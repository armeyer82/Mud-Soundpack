00:12:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:12:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person Accord gemini "Celestial Alhena", the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 188", the eight-person prime defense mark two "Salvation", and the vostok-class capsule "Blurr" are landed here.

[Starship "Salvation"; Weapons Room Six]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a large dark blue floor pillow here.

03:03:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:03:51 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "That was Vernos."

03:03:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:03:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:03:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:03:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:03:58 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:03:59 You say, "That fired on us."

03:03:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:04:00 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:04:00 Lily Kaise says, "I bet that was idiot Vernos."

03:04:02 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

03:04:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:04:30 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:04:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Striking Distance. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:04:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:04:37 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

03:04:40 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

03:04:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's not cool to fire upon your fellow pilots so please be careful in the future Vernos."

03:04:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:04:50 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:04:52 You exclaim, "Seriously!"

03:04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Why are you making a stink out of an accidental incident."

03:05:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I said oops."

03:05:19 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

03:05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Just reminding you and we don't take incidents like that lightly as you should know better."

03:06:13 Your ship 'Striking Distance' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:06:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Have a good night you two."

03:06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "All sectors are safe now."

03:06:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Understannd."

03:07:08 You say, "Actually,  don't think they fired on Nissi's ship. They locked on her twice."

03:07:45 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:07:48 Lily Kaise asks, "Nissi's ship where?"

03:08:14 Lily Kaise says, "I'm confused."

03:08:23 You say, "A long time ago, someone in another ship, locked on Nissi's ship twice. She grabbed a crew, went after them, interdicted them and blew them up."

03:08:41 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah that."

03:08:49 You say, "Just saying, he shouldn't take it lightly."

03:09:21 Lily Kaise says, "That wasn't someone in her alliance too which is even not cool but he needs to learn really fast that you need to watch your fire."

03:09:29 You say, "I know. Exactly."

03:09:47 Lily Kaise says, "'but he's gotten all arrogant and he didn't once apologize."

03:10:03 You say, "Yeah, well. Wait till he does that to someone else who will fire back."

03:10:04 Lily Kaise says, "Had he said to you in the sector hey man that was accidental."

03:10:17 You say, "Yeah, he didn't."

03:10:22 Lily Kaise says, "'I'd have a different impression."

03:10:29 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:10:36 You're already sitting.

03:10:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:10:38 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:10:41 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:10:43 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:11:12 Lily Kaise says, "But he stikes me as the type who would take pot shots and then try to infer they were a casual incident."

03:11:27 You say, "Well, he does it again, I'll fire back."

03:11:31 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

03:11:44 Lily Kaise says, "Well no just report to Ather."

03:11:51 Lily Kaise says, "Ather will handle him."

03:13:26 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:13:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Just dropping off some stuff at vermin control, then will go have a look. Thanks."

03:13:58 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:14:09 You say to Lily, "He's gotten all arrogant and is trying to prove himself by soloing in his escort."

03:14:32 Lily Kaise nods.

03:15:24 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:15:58 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

03:17:09 Lily Kaise says, "I'm tempted to write a note to Kim concerning his attitude."

03:17:34 [Tactical Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Gotcha. Thanks."

03:17:58 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

03:18:12 You nod. "Perhaps, not sure she'd do anything about it, but you could always try."

03:18:49 Lily Kaise says, "Well it would at least document his behavior and that he didn't apologize and he didn't take it seriously."

03:18:56 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well if anyone is interested. We have a few Pirates in Orion's belt."

03:19:05 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:19:22 Lily Kaise asks, "Want to go engage the ones in Orion or do they have it covered?"

03:19:32 You say, "Let's go check it out."

03:19:35 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:19:37 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:19:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:19:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:19:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:19:56 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:19:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:19:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:19:58 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:20:02 The ship is already moving.

03:20:06 The ship is already moving.

03:20:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:20:07 Which sector did you mean?

03:20:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:20:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:20:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

03:20:12 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

03:20:12 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

03:20:13 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:20:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:20:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:20:16 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: Wu7sU7SK.(h9b?/,cZ[Dw;%aBm.ghtMP.a_ZuuSW
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:20:18 Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

03:20:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:20:20 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:20:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:20:21 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:20:22 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

03:20:22 You pull Lily Kaise to her feet.

03:20:23 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:20:24 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:20:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:20:25 Lily Kaise glides up.

03:20:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:20:26 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:20:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

03:20:28 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:20:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:20:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:09:14 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:09:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:09:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:09:17 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: k{+\94Xuc`xkpY&\.f=,;6B9]at+8v'AtYrVcx5;
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

04:09:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:09:27 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:09:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

04:13:47 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

04:13:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:13:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:13:51 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:13:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:57 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:57 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:13:59 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

04:14:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:14:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:14:02 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:14:02 Lily Kaise says, "Surprised they didn't put interdicters up again."

04:14:04 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Nu-4" has jumped out of the sector.

04:14:04 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Striking Distance! Welcome to home space!"

04:14:05 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Alpha-7" has jumped out of the sector.

04:14:07 You say, "Yeah, me too."

04:14:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:14:12 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:14:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:14:16 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:14:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Striking Distance. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:14:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:14:30 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:14:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:14:31 You are credited with 431,250.00 AEU credits of bounty.
21,562.50 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

07:07:15 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well...Okay. I can't exactly let my hair down. But the point stands."

07:07:29 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Leave the points out of this."

07:07:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:07:44 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Why can't you let your hair down."

07:08:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Because it's a super short mohawk. It's not long enough to let down."

07:08:23 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hell ya."

07:08:31 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "And actually I am already getting back to work."

07:08:42 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "What you doing."

07:08:51 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "What, are you standing around by a payphone ordering from SSN again?"

07:09:00 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's hard work."

07:09:02 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Mail deliveries."

07:09:08 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence yawns.

07:09:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah snickers.

07:09:12 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's not work."

07:09:34 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Doing a little of that before coming back to our side of the skim."

07:10:06 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well last thing I heard, she was trying to run mail out of Helios station. So I don't know about that not being hard work. Damn, delivery to foxtrot would be a nightmare."

07:10:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I remember the day I engineered 8 beacons. And 2 missions all in a row. That...That. was work right there."

07:10:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

07:10:34 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Especially with no beacon amp."

07:10:42 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "It's not going to help her alliance one little bit."

07:10:46 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Correct."

07:10:59 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Wait, the mail runs don't?"

07:11:13 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Not enough to amount to a thing."

07:11:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hardly. If at all. It's salvaging. And combat that help the most."

07:11:26 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Oh alright, I can agree with that in the overall."

07:11:51 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "I have done a lot of that and will do lots more."

07:11:58 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I have just been working on artifacts, Then salvage loads, and then some battlesuit work."

07:12:20 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What's the name of your salvaging ship, Angela?"

07:12:40 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Dandelion."

07:12:41 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I'm trying to get enough industry to pick up a Revo battery so I can run some decent Beacons."

07:13:14 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "And trying to figure out how many we have around still for beacons or missions."

07:13:27 [General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Industry is one thing I am currently unable to get so any salvaging I do is for the sole purpose of helping the alliance."

07:14:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's mainly ground combat, and exploration that do the least for goals. Meaning like. You'd have to get stupid amounts of artifacts for them to make a difference. This is just what I've noticed while I've been whip. But starship Combat and Industry? That really, smashes goals."

07:14:46 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I haven't been whip yet. That's what the current whip wants me to do next term."

07:15:07 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Um."

07:15:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Actually, I think I'll just be quiet."

07:16:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

07:18:15 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Actually dude. I think you'd be a good whip. I always see you working. Getting groups together for things...So good luck. I hope you get it."

07:18:45 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I just hope I can do as well as Erik has already."

07:18:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

07:19:35 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "All you have to do is show up about 30 percent of the time and put out a comm notice and you'll be doing better than he has."

07:19:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well if you've got any questions. You can always ask him. Or if he isn't around. Feel free to ask me. I've been whip I think...2. maybe 3 terms. and many of my alliance say I'm a good one. So if you need a hand..."

07:19:55 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I'm wincing, even though you can't see it."

07:20:11 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "He's had it two out of the last three terms, including the present one. He's very seldom been around at all."

07:24:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "See...Right now I'm being a little lazy. But in total I think I did 7 beacons today. So I'm allowed. But in a bit I'll go do accord salvage missions."

07:25:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I do enjoy just laying here though, staring at fish. I have too many fish. Maybe."

07:26:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nicolette, no comment from the peanut gallery."

07:32:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins wiggles his hairy palps endearingly.

07:34:00 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

09:09:07 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You come do that. You know where to find me."

09:09:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

09:09:19 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Should I compress them?"

09:09:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh, and I'm going to steal ears."

09:41:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Assuming I can swipe parts from everywhere."

09:41:28 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Let me know if you want a hand with that."

09:41:40 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I haven't worked with stations yet. The experience could be cool."

09:42:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure. I'm almost sure Mel will have what I need on her ship. If not, I'll go part hunting. That can be fun sometimes."

09:44:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah cheers. "That poor sensor charge hybrid is all grown again."

09:44:59 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What does it do?"

09:45:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It kicks your rift sensors up in a huge way, and also boosts your charge."

09:46:16 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Holy cow, that's awesome."

09:46:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Um, I see a rescue pod on the earth landing pad. Who popped?"

09:46:55 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "It was one of those new folks I believe. Not sure, the one they call Boss I believe. Not positive."

09:47:21 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Ship name was Trucker I believe?"

10:33:31 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "They are headed out for a upgrade from Tomtown and Andy's."

10:33:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Heya Ted. Apparently, but nothing special. Just Aisling taking her ship for the usual upgrades."

10:33:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But of course. Every single person that move had to go."

10:34:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah coughs. "Could move."

10:34:13 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Then why didn't we go."

10:34:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Good question."

10:34:32 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You would have, if you hadn't been stuck with pirates in orion."

10:34:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I was taking a nap at the time, so I guess breathing doesn't count as moving."

10:34:39 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

10:35:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm actually glad I'm around here the next day or two anyway."

10:35:04 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Actually, no. I have been discovering without exploration. Going out so far is bad for me."

10:35:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I wouldn't have gone anyway. I'll pass."

10:35:30 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Who has gone?"

10:35:43 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Rogue wanted me to go, but I told her I didn't have the points so it was pointless. So I stayed here to work on that."

10:36:18 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Fuck, everyone for the most part. They tried to nab ather I guess but he dove out of the ship as it was launching."

10:36:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I don't even know. Apparently they had 2 half-starts, and more people piled in each time."

10:36:29 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Rogue probably doesn't know what's been going on with trips lately anyway."

10:37:07 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What HAS been going on with trips lately?"

10:38:38 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hells and i'm just struggling to make 20 mill for a upgrade."

10:38:54 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I believe so, she replaced Oricle."

10:38:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I remember those days all too well, trust me, your work will pay off."

10:39:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah. Also augmented again."

10:39:08 [General Communication] Ted Warburton sighs.

10:39:25 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Making money sometimes seems to take forever."

10:39:42 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I am to the point almost where mining will be a good idea again."

10:39:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It does when you really need it, then you get to a point when your work starts to pay off and everything is easier."

10:40:35 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I hope so, this is beating my ass. Just needing to finish up some upgrades so I have a gunship for beacons."

10:40:43 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Then suddenly, you can afford 3 billion for a spider. You're all like "How in the wide blue fuck did I get here?""

10:40:50 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Um woh."

10:40:52 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I know right."

10:40:57 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "No spider thank you very much."

10:41:03 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I can't even picture having that much at the moment."

10:41:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If anyone sees a spider and has the credits, get it for me please and I'll pay you back."

10:41:27 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I don't want a spider pet, but you know what'd be awesome? A portable hot tub."

10:41:30 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Weell I was out at that Op and I could have had like a billion credits. But I had a little issue."

10:41:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll send you a photo of my 2 jacob. Just so you can quietly scream."

10:41:54 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Fuck that noise."

10:42:01 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Eve, are you a pilot, or an animal keeper?"

10:42:02 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "God I hate spider's."

10:42:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am proudly both."

10:44:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hmmm. Should I send you a photo of anubis? All those sculls on his hair? Or Maybe Sekhmet."

10:44:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah cackles!

10:44:40 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Both."

10:46:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Funny thing is. At the moment. And for the foreseeable future. I have 4 of them."

10:46:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Why?"

10:47:00 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "You have four spiders?"

10:47:05 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I do."

10:47:23 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Holy cow."

10:47:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Because I'm looking after Nicolette's for her. But she's not in a situation where they've got the best place to stay. So for now, and for most likely quite a while, I have hers."

10:47:48 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "At one point I was overjoyed that my total net worth was getting damn close to one spider."

10:48:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I thought she had an apartment."

10:48:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "She does. But she might be getting rid of it, because it's not worth the rent."

10:48:59 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What's the rent? Is it that bad?"

10:49:24 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Fuck that, it only takes an hour's work to pay the rent."

10:49:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's a top floor apartment on earth. But I see where she's coming from. Why keep it, if you're hardly there?"

10:50:11 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I completely understand that. I'd rent an apartment consisting of only one room: a hot tub."

10:50:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I just find it worthwhile to have a place to come home to, and I do come back most nights."

10:50:27 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "It's pretty much the only room I use in my own apartment."

10:50:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh, it's not a money thing. That woman could not work for a year and still have money for her rent. But why spend credits when you don't need to?"

10:50:45 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I let my place go as well."

10:50:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "New use for the hot tub, guest bedroom."

10:50:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

10:50:57 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "75 mill and I wasn't even home much."

10:51:08 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's more than ours to be fair."

10:51:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So for now. I'm probably the only pilot with 4 damn spiders. 2 male, 2 female."

10:51:36 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I've a vacant guest room if you need a temporary spot. Complete with Sarah's old bed she didn't bring."

10:51:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah whistles.

10:51:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Luja, you go girl. You get that."

10:52:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My second bedroom is a meditation kind of room at the moment, but I spend a lot of time out here on my balcony."

10:52:31 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Yeah, I think I'll switch. She got the extra fancy jello bed and I have the plain old plank and mattress."

10:53:13 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I have a Sun Room I'm going to setup a Telescope in so I can view Luna from there."

10:53:34 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I miss hang out on the balcony."

10:53:41 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I have to come visit Jacob, and then you can go to Luna and wave back!"

10:53:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I must admit, I love the fresh air here, and it's so close to everything."

10:55:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and

10:56:52 A small suitcase isn't open.

10:56:54 [General Communication] Tare Maciel transmits, "Uh. Hello?"

10:56:54 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

10:57:03 You open a small suitcase.

10:57:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

10:57:07 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from elsewhere.

11:05:07 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

11:06:07 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

11:06:09 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

11:06:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

11:36:08 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

11:36:30 [MTTS] rosey: I love the way this game is coded.

11:38:15 [MTTS] rosey: Specifically the fact you can for rxample type put core in sack and it will make you pick up the core and put it in the sack instead of like most other games where it would say you don't have that or something similar.

11:41:08 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

11:45:08 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo jumps onto a dark purple leather captain's chair and immediately settles in.

11:45:08 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo lies down and curls up into a tight ball, closes its eyes, and appears to sleep.

11:57:21 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hey, how long's the trip top 777?"

11:58:10 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Like 6 hours tops."

11:58:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It depends. But since a certain org isn't giving us inserters at the moment. You will need a carrier. Or to get someone to run you out there in a carrier. Johann and I have been doing just that for people who want to go. Nicolette has been helping out too."

11:58:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "6 hours? The hell?"

11:59:02 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "If your flow sucks."

11:59:02 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Ohh. Regular rift trip?"

11:59:10 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Which orgs?"

11:59:19 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "If you can use the bubble, there's really nothing to be gained by you going to 777, those are just local artifacts, one point each at best."

11:59:23 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Yes, I don't think Rogue has sail extenders on hers."

11:59:40 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Oh. I was thinking for salvaging."

11:59:53 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yes. But did Rogue travel out of Mir. Using the accelerator?"

11:59:58 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Grades 20 up to 40 shipwrecks."

12:00:05 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Ah, salvaging. Well yeah, you can do that, but you'll need a rift drive on your transport, for now anyway."

12:00:23 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "20 to 40 shipwrecks at 777?"

12:00:26 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "We left out of battle of mir and I am not sure."

12:00:44 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Well that was your first mistake."

12:00:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The org that was. Giving us inserters and for now has decided not to. Is starseekers."

12:01:00 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You leave from Mir, not Battle of Mir."

12:01:22 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Groan ouch."

12:01:52 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Have they given any reason?"

12:02:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yes. You leave from Mir, and there is a lovely accelerator there that I take care of. That would have made your trip like 2 hours max."

12:02:38 Automatic daily maintenance is complete.

12:03:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Because Melinda was looking for another place, they decided not to help us out at this stage. So the only thing we can offer is to carry people out there that wish to salvage. It's not the best way, but it's all we've got. My hands are tied, sadly."

12:03:58 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Melinda is I seekers?"

12:04:02 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Can you tug ships through the rift?"

12:04:13 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

12:04:24 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good morning."

12:04:27 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'll be honest, I support 777 so that people have the choice, but me, personally, I find it faster and easier, and get just as many points for the time investment, if I do comets round Orion."

12:04:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No. It was Kim's decision."

12:04:48 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What exactly was my decision?"

12:04:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Talk of the devil, good morning."

12:05:18 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Moring kim."

12:05:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "People were asking about inserters for mir. They asked me why you guys decided not to give them at this stage, and I explained your reason as you wrote it to me."

12:05:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Uh, for 777."

12:06:20 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I am out at 777. At the moment I left out of mir."

12:06:34 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, there were safety concerns for the pilots who go there,w with a fair amount of IFS being reported in the area on a regular basis, and too far out to easily send help."

12:06:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It came up because I mentioned that we've been carrying all the people out there that wish to salvage lately that can't get rift drives."

12:07:13 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Maybe so. But I think if people understand the risks and want to salvage, I'm not going to get in their way."

12:07:22 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Saw a pirate out here last night."

12:07:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Even just yesterday, I ended up doing 2 trips out and back for people."

12:07:44 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Pilot life is a risk, so it's all good."

12:08:12 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

12:08:17 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I want to support newer pilots who are still scrambling to get their first few hundred industry points and their first artifacts."

12:08:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I mean there is a watchtower. It's also carefully placed for people to use. I'm extremely dedicated to that place. So yeah, I'll carry people out if they like it, and it's my only option."

12:08:43 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "With the current solution, I assume that people are at least made aware of potential risks."

12:09:28 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And here is the issue, when there are ifs in sector, you are most likely not able to land on the watch tower."

12:09:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Of course. I would never, ever let a pilot go out there without them knowing. This way is extremely time consuming for those of us who have offered to carry people, but it's what we've gotta do."

12:09:51 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "We should have a list somewhere with the temp stations, their purposes, their risks and how to manage."

12:09:59 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You could simply have waited a few days, to see whether we could find something equally as good closer to home."

12:10:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We can, at least, teach pilots the best way to avoid being hit, and thus be able to land."

12:10:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I did let them go down. But I had heard nothing, and I had like 3 people ask me what was going on with 777. I couldn't sit back and let them have no access."

12:12:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It seems more people use the area than even I realized. So we do what we can."

12:15:02 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Finding a good place is not easy. And I know it is not the same, but for just a week or 2, people could have managed with belt of Orion or battle of Mir. Whether shipwreks are actually more efficient for points is debatable, but I know people just like them."

12:15:49 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "In the end of the day, it is your time you spend, but those are the reasons why we decided not to support 777."

12:15:55 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's exactly it. People do like them. So who am I to stop access to something pilots enjoy?"

12:16:13 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

12:17:20 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I don't have any idea of what it costs for an org getting parts and builging stations."

12:17:50 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I did salvage shipwrecks too, at some point. I think all of us pilots go through the shipwreck phase at one point in our life. I am not unsympathetic, but as a fellow pilot I do feel concerned for people."

12:17:52 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU High-Gain Solar Transmitter at Home Beacon Alpha 270 is shutting down.

12:18:09 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My shipwreck phase is my missions right now, I must admit."

12:18:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And on another note, Oooo, I like this Neddle Gun."

12:18:37 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I could give a rundown of general costs for temp stations, if you like."

12:18:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Needle."

12:19:01 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Credits were not my concern in this decision at all."

12:19:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Anyone can browse at the shop on Accord."

12:19:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As do we all. But we take risks every day as pilots. For me, shipwrecks aren't a phase. They aren't for others that I know as well. People like what they like. I can't abide salvaging asteroids, simply hate it. But shipwrecks I can salvage for hours."

12:19:15 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I would kim, could I bother you to send me it?"

12:19:23 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I love salvage recks."

12:19:30 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "It is just credits?"

12:19:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Exactly, this is what I'm saying, it's not my thing, but I welcome people having the choice."

12:19:53 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm all about choice."

12:20:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not credits if you're buying for an org, but credits if you're buying for yourself."

12:20:13 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "A Dime At A Time". The organization has earned 190,031.79 credits.

12:21:00 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ok, for the exact details I do encourage you to visit the shop on accord. But each station needs at least a basic top, that is anywhere between 5 and 10 milion credits. A core is 5 milion credits, and the power source varies, for beacon and accelerator stations we usually use the large precharged battery which is 40 milion credits, all EAOS credits by the way."

12:21:37 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "And there is need of 4 stations, right?"

12:22:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My org and Lily's cover every station. The only thing we can't get ourselves. Is inserters. Everything else. We gladly cover."

12:23:13 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Uh. My apologies. Also Nicolette's org. And Ali's. Put in parts too. But by choice. They asked us."

12:25:05 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "The roid station has inserters?"

12:25:14 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Kinky."

12:25:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The one at 285?"

12:25:24 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yes?"

12:25:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It does."

12:25:39 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Right, thanks."

12:25:41 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "To travel to any temporary beacon without a rift drive you need inserters."

12:25:57 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "They are built on the same station that has the accelerator that lets you travel faster."

12:26:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

12:26:14 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Been there once when A cadet."

12:27:29 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Dandelion". The organization has earned 73,411.96 credits.

12:28:00 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Right, the passive beacon, someone told me, costs 5 milion credits. The basic inserter is 20 mil, which is currently also the only one Starseekers can contribute because of points."

12:29:07 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The rift accelerators go anywhere from 5 milion to 40 milion, the more advanced, the faster the acceleration."

12:29:26 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Thankd kim."

12:30:07 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Then we are not even talking about ship chargers, repair and rearm, watchtowers, transmitters..., salvage processors."

12:30:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "For orgs, it's the megacredits that matter, and what we can get based on our points, so the harder we work, the more we can do for people, for those orgs that have the megacredits to do it."

12:31:15 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So yes, it is safe to say that Allied Libertarians and Space explorers amidst the stars, and other orgs, put in a fair amount of credits. 777 doesn't allow them to earn them back, but other projects probably easily make up for that."

12:31:56 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I thought it cost something else besides credits and megacredits."

12:32:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh. The command we get makes up for it. And as Ted said. It's not like we use credits. It's megacredits. And those we have. With plenty to spare."

12:33:01 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, yes. Megacredits are really just a different form of credits. 1 megacredit is worth 5 milion credits, although more advanced orgs can convert them for less than that."

12:35:01 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Still, I mean it when I say, credits, megacredits, costs, time, had nothing to do with the decision I made about 777. If I can help newer pilots and orgs who are still working to build up, I will gladly do it. There are 2 really basic requirements. One, it needs to be used, and 2, people who go there need to be prepared to deal with potential risks."

12:35:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And it does get used, and they are prepared. I dunno what else to tell you."

12:35:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Kim, the last few days, I've seen more people than ever before wanting to use 777. I know demand used to be low, but that seems to have changed."

12:36:00 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Another question, wouldn't something the same even closer to home be nicer?"

12:36:33 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Of course it would, if the grade is the same, there's no point coming closer to home for a grade we can get at home."

12:36:51 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Maybe. Except that people are happy with this. I've had no complaints what so ever about the distance."

12:36:59 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "It's not that far."

12:37:13 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How far exactly is it again, refresh my memory please?"

12:37:17 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They found a place slightly closer, but the grade was 10 lower."

19:14:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If a passive scan does the job, then avoid the ping, and certainly don't ping in areas where you don't want to attract attention to yourself."

19:14:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

19:20:47 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "4 or 6."

19:20:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "However many you feel like."

19:21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not on the starmap."

19:21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They'll just show as debris chunks."

19:21:29 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I'm gonna go buy 4, 6 or however many I like. Could anyone stand by while I do a solo beacon? I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. And I just upgraded my torpedos."

19:21:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if you scan for debris specifically, it will tell you what the chunks are."

19:21:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Assuming you're in range."

19:21:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is always wise to upgrade your grapple from the stock one when you can."

19:22:04 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I am close to orion, just shout if you need help, but there will be reinforcements."

19:22:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Thought so thanks. I don't think I have a scanner I have not done any upgrades on my ship."

19:22:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It should come with a scanner."

19:22:35 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "If you want we can do a scout beacon and you can fly."

19:22:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You have a bsic debris scanner, all salvage ships do."

19:22:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Thanks."

19:22:52 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I generally never buy more than 3 or maybe 4 beacons, unless I know I will be flying more."

19:24:23 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

19:24:29 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I may be up for scout beacon after. I get an almost inappropriate satisfaction the few times I survive a solo beacon."

19:24:40 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Need that fix first."

19:24:41 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "All right, have fun."

21:17:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

21:49:33 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:49:33 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:53:06 Your battlesuit is holding a greater minimodule of explosives boost and laser resistance.

21:53:14 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

21:53:14 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a Fringe Hunter here.
You can go up and out.

21:53:16 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

21:53:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:53:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:53:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:53:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:53:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:53:28 The ship is already moving.

21:53:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:53:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:53:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:53:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

21:53:38 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

21:53:38 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:53:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:53:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:53:42 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:53:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

21:53:44 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:53:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:53:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:53:47 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:53:50 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

21:53:51 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:53:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

21:53:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:53:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:53:58 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:54:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

21:54:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:54:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:54:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:54:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:54:15 You scramble to your feet.

21:54:15 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:54:15 You exit the ship.

21:54:16 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The one-person cargo hauler "Trash" and the two-person Accord gemini "Fearless" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and Vim the mound of parking tickets here.
Nathaniel Owens is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

21:54:20 [Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

21:54:20 You see a gleaming granite-topped bar, a public holovid, and a brightly-lit candy vending machine here.
Angela Caesar is sleeping on a comfortable black leather couch.
You can go out.

21:54:27  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

21:54:27 You are carrying nothing.

21:54:31 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "We need an AEU 2 or 3."

21:54:36 Nathaniel Owens just arrived.

21:54:43 You wave to Nathaniel Owens.

21:54:48 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:54:55 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can switch to my AEU 3."

21:55:04 Nathaniel Owens speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

21:55:05 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Please."

21:55:47 Evenia Callseah just arrived.

21:55:47 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

21:55:53 You hug Evenia Callseah.

21:55:54 Evenia Callseah hugs you.

21:55:56 You say to Evenia, "Hi!"

21:56:01 Evenia says to you, "Hi!"

21:56:04 You smile at Evenia Callseah.

21:56:22 Evenia Callseah orders a petite steak sandwich.

21:56:25 Evenia Callseah dangles a petite steak sandwich in front of a Tardick lizard named Zeus. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

21:56:31 Evenia Callseah winces.

21:57:02 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 549" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

21:57:12 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "Careful now, I need those."

21:57:17 You grin.

21:57:22 Nathaniel Owens waves to Evenia Callseah.

21:57:25 You ask, "He try to eat your fingers?"

21:57:27 Evenia Callseah waves to Nathaniel Owens.

21:57:30 Evenia Callseah nods.

21:57:58 Evenia says to Nathaniel, "We can take my mule. We'll just take out the rats the old way. She's fully upgraded."

21:58:06 Nathaniel Owens says, "Ok. Lets go for it."

21:58:14 Evenia Callseah glances around at her surroundings.

21:58:16 You ask, "Don't we need one more?"

21:58:20 Evenia Callseah says, "We do."

21:58:22 Nathaniel Owens says, "Oh, yes."

21:58:24 Evenia Callseah laughs.

21:58:26 You laugh.

21:58:27 Nathaniel Owens speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

21:58:27 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "One for a nest?"

21:58:50 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I can join but I only have a tier 1 AEU. Also I'm on Farport."

21:59:02 Evenia Callseah speaks into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator:

21:59:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Guindalen, you were interested in a nest?"

21:59:57 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 549" lift off of the landing pad and ascend into space.

22:00:00 Evenia Callseah speaks into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator:

22:00:00 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Come on. One person, just one. Low-tier."

22:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:43 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Got time to wait for me to come back from Farport?"

22:00:58 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "And is tier 1 AEU high enough?"

22:01:05 Nathaniel Owens speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:01:05 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Sure, and sure."

22:01:11 Nathaniel Owens asks, "I'm running league, that ok?"

22:01:16 You say, "Sure."

22:01:16 Evenia Callseah nods.

22:01:31 You say, "Might be better for Eve to switch back to her rental though."

22:01:36 Evenia says to Nathaniel, "If you find a lens, I will pay you grandly for it."

22:01:38 You say, "So she can back up repairs."

22:01:45 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 164" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

22:01:48 Nathaniel says to Evenia, "Where would I find a lense?"

22:01:57 [Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I'm on my way. Where to?"

22:02:01 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Ok, eve, can you switch back to rental?"

22:02:07 Nathaniel Owens speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:02:07 Evenia Callseah says, "Maybe, but we might take a bit of damage. That tier 1 AEU can only do miner repairs."

22:02:07 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Chetumal."

22:02:07 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Chet."

22:02:23 You nod.

22:02:33 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

22:02:34 Nathaniel Owens says, "Tru."

22:02:49 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean, I can if you want. But it might be safer to keep the AEU."

22:02:57 Nathaniel Owens says, "Just keep the AEU then."

22:03:33 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

22:03:37 You say, "But rental can do repair s too and still do damage."

22:03:54 Evenia Callseah nods. "True. Okay I'll switch down."

22:04:01 Evenia Callseah tramps out.

22:04:01 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters after Evenia Callseah.

22:04:31 Evenia Callseah just arrived.

22:04:31 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

22:04:33 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

22:04:41 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 164" lift off of the landing pad and ascend into space.

22:04:52 You smile at Evenia Callseah.

22:05:01 Evenia Callseah says to you, "Can you cover the gunning on one side. Including the fort? I'm um. Better at engineering than gunning those."

22:05:23 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 549" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

22:05:24 You grin. "Yep."

22:05:32 Evenia Callseah smiles at you. "Thanks."

22:05:33 A pair of pilots near the doorway begin arguing loudly about the largest ship they could fly by themselves.

22:05:44 You smile at Evenia Callseah. "No problem."

22:06:10 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:06:10 Evenia says to Nathaniel, "You're flying. She's got a locator though, so never fear."

22:06:20 You grin.

22:06:26 Nathaniel says to Evenia, "A locater?"

22:06:30 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:06:54 Evenia Callseah says, "If you forget what way you went. You can just hit that locate button. And you'll find out."

22:07:09 Nathaniel Owens says, "Ah, I see."

22:07:35 Evenia says to Nathaniel, "Just please don't forget to hide her. There are 7 aquariums on this ship. I'd rather not lose them."

22:07:44 Nathaniel Owens says, "I won't."

22:08:12 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "It's all good. You've got time."

22:08:20 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 549" lift off of the landing pad and ascend into space.

22:09:38 Evenia Callseah says, "Let me just go double check something."

22:09:39 Evenia Callseah tramps out.

22:09:39 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters after Evenia Callseah.

22:09:54 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 164" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

22:10:12 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person Accord gemini "Quinacridone Rose" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

22:10:27 Evenia Callseah just arrived.

22:10:27 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

22:10:40 Luja Garland just arrived.

22:10:42 Luja Garland waves.

22:10:43 Luja Garland says, "Hello."

22:10:44 You wave to Luja Garland.

22:10:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Talk about overkill. I put heavy lasers on that thing for some reason."

22:10:48 You say to Luja, "Hi."

22:11:04 You say, "I put heavy lasers on my mule."

22:11:05 Luja Garland says, "I'm ready to go."

22:11:12 Evenia Callseah nods.

22:11:16 Evenia Callseah holds Nathaniel Owens's hand, taking him into her group.

22:11:18 Evenia Callseah holds your hand, taking you into her group.

22:11:19 Angela Caesar suddenly awakens.

22:11:20 Evenia Callseah holds Luja Garland's hand, taking her into her group.

22:11:26 You wave to Angela Caesar.

22:11:29 Angela Caesar waves.

22:11:48 Angela Caesar stretches.

22:11:55 Evenia says to Nathaniel, "Um. You might wanna go switch to your league. Unless you intend to run league. In a rental?"

22:12:03 Nathaniel Owens says, "Oh yeah. Shit."

22:12:04 You chuckle.

22:12:09 Angela Caesar asks, "Why not?"

22:12:12 Luja Garland waves to Angela Caesar.

22:12:13 Angela Caesar laughs.

22:12:19 You laugh at Angela Caesar.

22:12:32 Nathaniel says to Angela, "Because i'm not completely insane, although eve will most likely tell you otherwise."

22:12:38 Evenia Callseah laughs.

22:12:39 You chuckle.

22:12:42 Nathaniel Owens strides out.

22:12:43 Angela Caesar says, "I should go salvaging in mutuality space so I can buy a rental suit."

22:12:50 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 164" lift off of the landing pad and ascend into space.

22:12:57 You say, "And Eve will also tell you that I am totally norma."

22:12:59 Evenia Callseah says, "Um."

22:13:05 You say, "Er, normal."

22:13:10 Angela Caesar laughs.

22:13:15 Evenia Callseah says, "You don't need to salvage in mutuality space to get a rental."

22:13:26 Angela Caesar asks, "Sure you are not Norma?"

22:13:30 Angela Caesar laughs.

22:13:32 You laugh.

22:13:33 Evenia Callseah looks at you thoughtfully.

22:13:34 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

22:13:37 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 549" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

22:13:37 Nathaniel Owens just arrived.

22:13:38 Angela Caesar says, "That is a nice name."

22:13:43 You say, "Yep, sure I'm not norma. But I am normal."

22:13:50 Evenia Callseah holds Nathaniel Owens's hand, taking him into her group.

22:13:58 Angela Caesar scrambles to her feet.

22:13:58 Angela Caesar struts out.

22:14:00 Evenia Callseah says, "Much better."

22:14:02 Evenia Callseah laughs.

22:14:05 You laugh.

22:14:11 Evenia Callseah asks, "We good?"

22:14:17 You say, "Yes ma'am."

22:14:20 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:14:26 Luja Garland says, "I'm ready."

22:14:29 Nathaniel Owens nods.

22:14:35 Evenia Callseah says, "To the aquarium then. Uh. I mean mule."

22:14:37 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters after Evenia Callseah.

22:14:37 You follow Evenia Callseah out.

22:15:08 You peer west...

22:15:08 
[Starship "Golden Dragon"; Weapons Room One]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a large bubbling cerulean blue-lit aquarium containing green aquatic life and metallic silver and dark blue round rocks here.
Luja Garland is standing here.
You can go east.

22:15:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:15:18 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

22:15:21 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

22:15:22 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

22:15:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:15:32 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

22:15:34 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

22:15:40 Evenia Callseah wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:15:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:15:47 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:15:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:15:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:16:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:16:20 You gently caress Evenia Callseah's back.

22:16:21 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

22:16:21 [Starship "Golden Dragon"; Engineering Room]

22:16:21 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a large bubbling metallic gold-lit aquarium containing red and white aquatic life and metallic silver and metallic gold round rocks and Vartija the arachnoid security robot here.

22:16:44 Evenia Callseah snuggles up to your shoulder.

22:16:48 You cuddle up to Evenia Callseah.

22:16:53 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There are some in room one."

22:17:05 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "There's a couple in every room."

22:17:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep, and in room 2."

22:17:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:17:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:17:50 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm not actually this fish mental. But Sean said he can't look after all these anymore, so gave them all to me."

22:17:57 You say, "Ah, ok."

22:18:05 Evenia Callseah says, "I love fish, but I'm not insane."

22:18:06 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:18:11 You grin.

22:18:13 You chuckle.

22:18:25 Evenia Callseah says, "But I couldn't exactly say no to the guy. So I set them all up on here."

22:18:33 You say, "That makes sense."

22:18:42 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's neck.

22:18:44 You say, "I only have a couple of aquariums."

22:18:51 Evenia Callseah says, "I had a spare robot, so it was easy."

22:18:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:18:56 You nod.

Starships: Golden Dragon (d) at (5, 1, 1)


22:19:01 Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is glossy obsidian and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a buckled black leather choker with a triple row of steel pyramid studs, a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with a design depicting a mighty grapple at work, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a pair of classically loose-fitting black leath
22:19:02 er pants, a chunky black leather belt with a double row of round spiked steel studs and a big skull-shaped buckle, and a pair of heavy black biker boots with steel toes. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both elbows, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

22:19:02 Evenia Callseah says, "I want butterfly maxwells."

22:19:18 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Hi Johann!"

22:21:11 Evenia Callseah asks, "You don't mind, do you?"

22:21:32 You ask, "Don't mind what?"

22:21:37 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Nate, head back. Luja needs to drop, but Johann will come."

22:21:44 You say, "Ah, ok."

23:29:17 You cheer.

23:29:22 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and begin speeding toward the waiting aerial fortress.

23:29:22 (20 seconds roundtime.)

23:29:42 [Aerial Fortress "Golden Egg"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

23:32:08 
[Starship "Golden Dragon"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a large bubbling metallic gold-lit aquarium containing red and white aquatic life and metallic silver and metallic gold round rocks and Vartija the arachnoid security robot here.
Evenia Callseah is standing here.
You can go north and south.

23:32:08 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "OH we can do a beacon!"

Evenia Callseah is standing here.
You can go north and south.
You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:32:17 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Wait what?"

23:32:19 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

23:32:23 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

23:32:25 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

23:32:27 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

23:32:27 You grin.

23:32:31 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You don't have a beacon launcher in here, blah."

23:32:36 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Good work everyone."

23:32:41 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Well why in all sanity would I?"

23:32:49 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "To do a beacon after the nest."

23:32:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:32:49 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

23:32:59 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he chuckles.

23:33:00 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:33:03 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Hey, you're the nut who did what you did the other day. Holy fuck."

23:33:05 The damage control computer reports, "Repair of the wormhole drive has been completed."

23:33:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:33:27 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

23:33:34 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, it wasn't that scary."

23:33:39 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Admit it. Admit to the other combat pilot aboard what you did."

23:33:44 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "You complete nut."

23:33:53 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's nothing compared with what I'm going to do."

23:33:56 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Who's the other combat pilot?"

23:33:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:34:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:34:09 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ooooooooo, listen to that."

23:34:11 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Me."

23:34:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:34:37 A medium-sized blue creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with medium-length spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

23:34:38 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

23:34:41 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "And hey, at least this other thing I've agreed to."

23:34:44 You cuddle up to Evenia Callseah.

23:34:47 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

23:34:52 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

23:34:52 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do I even wanna know?"

23:35:02 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "We're doing an overdriven corvette."

23:35:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:35:10 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Woo!"

23:35:10 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I have to see this."

23:35:25 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can I stand in storage and watch?"

23:35:28 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "We smash very highs, most often without getting touched. So we figure we may as well try."

23:36:05 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:36:13 Evenia Callseah nuzzles your neck softly.

23:36:20 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:36:22 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

23:36:37 A small red creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with long spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

23:36:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:36:49 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "But the other day. That nut kidnapped me, and we did a high, in a totally un upgraded corvette."

23:36:49 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh good Evenia you're home!"

23:36:54 Evenia Callseah presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.
