Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.

periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it.
Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered
with brightly hued butterflies.
Lily Kaise glides out.
The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.
A bugle sounds the order to attack and the battle escalates dramatically. Both
sides launch all-out assaults into the field.
The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct
hits.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
A bugle sounds the order for retreat, and the soldiers who lived through the
assault rush back to the trench.
The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."
The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.
A bugle sounds the order to attack and the battle escalates dramatically. Both

An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and
advance into the fray.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
A bugle sounds the order for retreat, and the soldiers who lived through the
assault rush back to the trench.
A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and
shrapnel.
The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "What was your first ever ship?"
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "What happens if you join a battle and you
lose? Is your ship gone and you have to save up for a new one?"
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If you do not jump out, yes."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Pretty much, unless you escape, yes."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "But remember about insurance which can
mitigate the costs some."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "So if you jump out the ship gets rescued?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Jumping out means you run away, the
enemies don't follow out of the sector normally."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ahh I see."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There is also insurance to think about
of course, but depending on the ship, I might not bother."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "I'm thinking of buying a fritter as my
first ship instead of cargo hauler. Is tis a bad move for a newbie?"
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If I were you, I would perhaps speak
to the cadet officer in the pilot liaison office..."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Whats the command to find him again?"
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Got it, go office."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "The letters beside peoples names on the who
list. This is their alliance right?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Correct."
A single snowglobe zips up to the hovertrailer and circles you once before
continuing on.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Did anybody here start out with a fritter
as their first ship? Was it a disadvantage starting out do you feel? Or was the
ability for it to do combat worth it?"
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You could discuss that IC pretty
easily."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "True, true."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "From policy Newbies are free to use the
newbie channel to ask their questions. This channel is only for questions
followed by helpful responses. Note that "Ask IC" is not a helpful response -."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "From an ooc standpoint though, it
depends on what you are wanting your character to do. Also, how comfortable you
are with various mechanics of the game."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes, I was planning to answer. The IC
comment was not an order. It could be done IC in order to engage in conversation
with people is all."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "I was thinking as a newbie it might help to
be able to learn combat with a ship also, but I know from a making money point
of view cargo is advised for new people."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "My apologies, I just misunderstood your
intent Melinda. I wasn't trying to be obnoxious."
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "Don't worry about it too much. You can get
a fighter in an hour too."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If you are wanting to work on both,
the hauler may not be the right ship."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "If you're unfamiliar with combat you're
best off trying to gun on a group beacon first, that way you don't have to
learnt o fly and gun all at once."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "The combat aspect of the game is
something that we try to teach new people, and we use our ships for it most of
the time. It's not too important that you have a ship you can do combat in
starting out, in my opinion."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "I was gunning on somebodies ship last
night, it was pretty fast paced!"
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "My first ship was a cargo hauler,
because I was kind of afraid of the space combat, heh. I made plenty of money
with that thing."
[Newbie Help] Johann Rowan transmits, "Yeah, last night was not typical. When we
teach someone it's usually in a smaller ship with fewer enemies."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Remember they're not very expensive so
you can get a hauler now and a flitter later or vice versa."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Fighters have the same armament as the
flitter but are a little faster, the flitter is tougher so it may be a nice
option for starting out with combat over a fighter even if you have a hauler."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Oh, I thought they were expensive. So if I
got a flitter I could afford a hauler shortly enough anyway?"
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "Yup."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "A mil or two isn't much in our economy."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My first ship was a cargo hauler as
well. Credits are made easy as eating pancakes with those things."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Oh. I did not know that, hehe."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Mmm, cedit pancakes. I'd never have
credits if that were the case... Ahem anyway."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Yeah, cargo hauler's your best bet, in
my opinion. Also, don't forget to do some exploring and talk to anybody you come
across. You can get special missions designed to walk you through the game and
get your points and credits up."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The cadet orientation officer is
currently your best friend."
[Newbie Help] Demarco Scott transmits, "Yes indeed."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Excellent. Oh, I have 2,270,000 starting
cash. I think that's enough for both ships anyway!!"
A giant spider dashes up to the hovertruck bed, coming from behind at terrible
speed. It crawls over you quickly and disappears into the distance.

[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Does it matter whether a chaingun or laser
is fitted?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "For noncombat ships you want laser, ammo
takes cargo space."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That depends on personal preference,
you'll figure out what you like, and what you don't like."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If you are going to salvage with the
ship, I'd go lasers."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Kirk has a point too though."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ok cool. So chaingun is stronger but uses
up storage space?"
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "If you want to store anything much in
it, go lasers."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Lasers and chains both have their
charms."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Read the help and get the books that
tell you everything."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ok. Thanks guys."
The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides
to your driver.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "What is ftl?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Faster than light."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ah, so get in a ship and jump to it."
[Newbie Help] Johann Rowan transmits, "Yep."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Communications can also be faster than
light FYI."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Communications?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Light speed communications would take
years to arrive so they have to be faster than light."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "When you use a board reader it calls
itself the FTL interalliance board network or something."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Try tr 1 message."
Two skeletons riding skeletal horses draw alongside the hovertruck bed briefly
and stare across at you, blue points of light glittering in their empty
eyesockets.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Co-ordinates are confusing!"
[Newbie Help] Johann Rowan transmits, "It can be at first. It's laid out like
quadrant 1 on a cartesian grid though, if that helps."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "If you've done any graph stuff in school
maths it's like that, 1 1 1 is bottom left as seen from above and on the very
bottom slice."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Do I have to return my ship to earth before
leaving the game?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Not specifically no but it's wise to land
somewhere you can power off."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, don't log out with your ship
floating in space. It would be bad."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "So I wouldnt just log back on with me
inside it where I left it?"
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah...I don't recommend it. It can
get very expensive."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "You do but if your ship is in space your
ship will run out of power and life support wil cut out when it runs out
ejecting you in a pod."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "You will, but if you leave it in
space it'll run out of charge or get destroyed by some pirates or RATS or
something."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well you would, sure, but if you leave
it in space, you'll run out of battery."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "There are hostiles in this game of
various types. You might wake up and find your ship destroyed and that you have
been sent home in a pod."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Yeah that sounds bad."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "But if I land it on another planet will it
be ok to log off?"
[Newbie Help] Johann Rowan transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure thing."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Also a good piece of advice is to get a
spacesuit at the earliest convenience. You never know when you might need it."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ok will do."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "How do I land on a planet? I'm stuck in
space."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Type move, pick the planet from the list
then type y when it asks if you want to land."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Thanks."
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Any time, then just type power to shut
your ship off."
Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish
eagerly gobble them up.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "How do I get payed for courier job?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "You mean courier company? It comes in the
post at the end of each week."
A terrifyingly large eye peers through from the other side of the fishbowl. It
stares for a moment, then fades away.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Oh. Ok. Where is the post office?"
[Newbie Help] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Varies by planet, but like I said it only
gets sent once a week. You'll be notified when you land if you have any mail
waiting."
Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.
A terrifyingly large eye peers through from the other side of the fishbowl. It
stares for a moment, then fades away.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing
beneath the ocean waves.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing
beneath the ocean waves.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep
inside the starship.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Minor Change: Slightly adjusted bioaugmentation plant bonuses as well as rating
granularity for a certain statistic, to help continue to ensure that all plant
bonuses show up in engineering status.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.
A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Where is the post office? And what is a
hyperwave relay?"
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Never mind, found the hyperwave helpfile."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are many mail rooms. There is a
FIND command that you can use to help you find it. Try something like MAIL."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Mail centers are usually pretty close to
the landing pad."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ah great. Thanks."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you're needing to check your own
mail, try the spaceport on your capital world, which if I remember correctly,
for you would be Old Earth."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "I did a courier job and was looking to
check for payment."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They pay on midnight thursday
night/friday morning."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only once per week."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you did a courier job for one of the
courier companies, you get a credit chip in the mail with your cumulative pay
for the week."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you did a mail delivery job, you get
paid as soon as you deliver the mail."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ah I see. I signed up with a courier
company. Is that every rl week?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Mmhmm."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That is a very good activity for cadets
to help learn where things are."
[Newbie Help] Jason Rat transmits, "Yes, a RL week is the same as a week in Star
Conquest."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You get access to better equipped ships as
a courier as your rank goes up."
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Game time progresses at the same time as
real time, just 300 years in the future with an alternate timeline."
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Same rate as real time, rather."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "I should have started my guy at a younger
age. Did not think about aging!"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "We live a long time."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Unless your character is 80, I doubt
you'll have any huge, huge problem."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "What if he is over 80? Will that have an
effect?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Even then, you just have to have a very
good reason for that age."
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For why he became a pilot so late in
life."
[Newbie Help] Cid Strife transmits, "Ah ok. He's not, just checking if there was
physical disadvantages in game for age."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. Pilots pass a rigorous physical and
psychological examination. If your character could pass that at 80, there is no
reason he would have any of the classic problems associated with aging at that
time...best way I can think to put that."
The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in
the opposite direction.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the north.
A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a

Destroyed alien starships and space stations fill space in this area. Unlike
similar sites, the damage appears to be rather one-sided, with most of the
debris consisting of non-military equipment that is nonetheless rather
battle-scorched.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

l lily
Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a plain white spacesuit helmet, a light blue shipsuit with
cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs, a plain white spacesuit top, a
pair of plain white spacesuit gloves, a plain white spacesuit bottom, and a pair
of plain white spacesuit boots. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. Her face and
both eyes are left uncovered.
She is carrying a dense tetrahedron-shaped metallic mass in her right hand.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
