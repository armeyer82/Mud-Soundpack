00:27 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

00:27 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

00:27 You are carrying a glossy sheet of paper with "5 minutes" printed at the top in your left hand and a stun turret in your right hand.

01:34 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

01:34 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:34 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

01:34 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:34 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

01:34 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

01:34 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

01:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:34 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:34 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

01:34 The ship is already moving.

01:34 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:34 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:34 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:34 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

01:34 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your chair.

01:34 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:34 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:34 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:34 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

01:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:34 Select a ship:

01:34 [1] the six-person dart "Harvest Moon"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:34 Harvest Moon: 3, 9, 3

01:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:34 The three-person heliogaster "Dhamel" has jumped into the sector.

01:34 This ship transmits, "Hi"

01:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:34 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:34 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:34 Via general sector communication, Harvest Moon transmits: "hii"

01:34 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

01:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

01:35 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:35 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

01:35 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Delta."

01:35 You must stand up first.

01:35 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet.

01:43 Scott Franklin sings over the intercom.

01:43 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:43 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:43 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:43 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:43 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:43 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:43 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:43 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:43 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:44 You hear a high-pitched squeal as the starship emits a sustained long-range laser burst.

05:12 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light

05:12 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

05:15 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "1 spot mods."

05:16 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Landing."

05:17 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Beta."

05:17 You can't launch from here.

05:17 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

05:17 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

05:17 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

05:17 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

05:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

05:17 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

05:17 Select a ship:

05:17 [1] the eight-person gunship "Light of The Trees"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

05:17 Light of The Trees: 16, 20, 9

05:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

05:17 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

05:17 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

05:17 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

05:17 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

05:17 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

05:17 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

05:17 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:18 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:18 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:18 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:18 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

05:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

05:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:18 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

05:18 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

15:07 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

15:07 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:07 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the one-person expediter "Angel By Your Side" landed here.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Ontanka the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit the droid, Rar the droid, Acer the droid, Kaitlyn the droid, Nala the droid, Zia the droid, Insanity the droid, Cr

15:43 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:43 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

15:43 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

15:43 You are carrying nothing.

15:43 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

15:43 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:43 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

15:43 The ship is already moving.

15:43 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:43 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:43 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:43 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

15:43 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:43 The ship must be in space to do that.

15:43 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

15:43 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:43 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

15:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:43 Select a ship:

15:43 [1] the one-person flitter "Aie Avenger"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:43 Aie Avenger: 3, 10, 6

15:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:43 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:43 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

15:43 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

15:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

15:44 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:44 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:44 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

16:59 ["Shadowed Sunset" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
You see a squashy dark gold leather captain's chair, a flappy duck on wheels, Caly the droid, Mikey the droid, a fuzzy blue security drone, and a fuzzy blue medical drone here.
You see Cara West, Michael Calaway, and Brianna West here.
You can go south and out.

16:59 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

16:59 Cara West asks Brianna West, "where do you need a lift to?"

16:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

17:32 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

17:32 [Private | Britney Chance] You transmit, "I'm just sitting alone in my ship."

17:33 [Private | Britney Chance] Britney Chance transmits, "ah nice i'm living in my ship currently"

17:35 A red message board reader beeps quietly, indicating to you that there is a new message in OOC / Announcements. It was posted by Victor with the subject "Re: We need your help!".

17:35 [Private | Britney Chance] Britney Chance transmits, "well other then that not doing much i sleep to much my daughter doesn't like being cramped up in here and i'm just here bord"

17:36 [Private | Britney Chance] You transmit, "That's no fun. I could keep you company, if you'd like."

17:37 [Private | Britney Chance] Britney Chance transmits, "um sure why not where you at currently"

17:38 [Short-range Communication] Anton Navarro transmits, "Faster chubbo."

17:39 You can't launch from here.

17:39 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

17:39 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."
The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:39 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:39 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

17:39 The ship is already moving.

17:39 The ship is already moving.

17:39 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:39 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:39 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:39 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:39 The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

17:39 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:39 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

17:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:39 Select a ship:

17:39 [1] the four-person roborant "Twist of Fate"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:39 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:39 >> Command Aborted <<

17:39 The starship is already moving.

17:39 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:39 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

17:39 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

17:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

17:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:39 Via general sector communication, Twist of Fate transmits: "dolphins"

17:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

17:41 [Private | Britney Chance] You transmit, "I'm at Acrylon"

17:41 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Hello!

As has been somewhat evident, the administration team has been lacking in some areas. For various reasons, most of us are simply not able to dedicate as much time to Miriani as we once could. To alleviate this ongoing problem, we're hiring new hosts in the following areas:

   Builders - These people will be responsible for creating new areas in the game. They will be able to create new planets/space stations as required, but should adhere to the guidelines we set forth. Unlike what has been done in the past, we will provide new builder hosts with a beginning project that they should aim to complete, and once it has been completed, the new builder can work with us to commence building on a project that they would like to see in the game. Information on their initial project such as lore and backstory will be pre-determined by us (the wizards). They will also work with the event hosts to develop new areas that may be required for events. To receive an application, type HOST-APPLICATION.
 
  Event Hosts (aka event planners and carry outers) - These people will be responsible for planning and carrying out in-character events. This includes doing the work required to set up the environment (creating sectors, ships, planets, etc) as well as any character roleplaying involved to facilitate the event. They will also be responsible for discipline during their event and any rewards that should be given at the end of an event. Any events should be cleared with the majority of hosts before beginning. We expect event hosts to have a firm grasp of game mechanics and plot, as well as a strong ability to think on their feet and anticipate the outcome of any action they perform in character. To receive an event host application, type EVENT-APPLICATION.

   Programmers - These people will be responsible for developing new, large-scale systems for the game. Additionally, they will be tasked with fixing existing bugs, closing reports, and implementing player suggestions. They should have ample experience in working with MOO code or an intuitive understanding of the semantics of object-oriented programming, and should not have any penalties for scripting or cheating. To view the programmer application, visit http://www.toastsoft.net/programmer_application.txt. Once you've filled it out, send it along in an email to hosts@toastsoft.net.

You should be aware that none of these positions are paid, nor will you receive any in character benefits. The return on investment rests purely in the warm and fuzzy feeling that you get when players enjoy a new area, event, or system you've created yourself. Players with numerous policy violations need not apply, as we have little reason to trust you with any sort of administrative duty in the first place. Applicants should at the very minimum possess a moderate to advanced proficiency with the English language and spell checking, know how to use the shift key and put punctuation where it belongs, and be a team player.

So, what do you need to know:
   Builder Hosts:   Type HOST-APPLICATION. This creates a builder application. WRITE APPLICATION to fill it out and SUBMIT APPLICATION when you're done.
   Event Hosts:   Type EVENT-APPLICATION. This creates an event host application. WRITE APPLICATION to fill it out and SUBMIT APPLICATION when you're done.
   Programmers: Point a web browser to http://www.toastsoft.net/programmer_application.txt. Save the document, fill it out, and send it to hosts@toastsoft.net when you're done.

If you've already written an application and feel you could improve upon it, feel free to resubmit it with your new answers. We sincerely appreciate the time that everyone has taken reading this or applying! We hope that with your help we can continue to make Miriani great.

Hello,
A couple things:
   * Applicants should apply before June 30. We will temporarily close submissions next Friday while we process the existing ones and select candidates.
   * A few people have expressed interest in what the time commitments are for being a host. My answer is, as this is on a completely volunteer basis, there aren't many. However, we do ask that you let us know if you won't be available and complete work in a timely manner if there are deadlines.


Thanks for your interest!

17:57 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, and a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end here.
You see Britney Chance here.
You can go south, down, and out.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
