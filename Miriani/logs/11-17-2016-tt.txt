Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid

Subject: My capsule trip to Andy's for Lily
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 02:33 17 November 2316 GST
--
I am posting this event in its entirety. I had sent a letter with pertenant
quotes to Ather previously. Miss Kaise has since returned home and shoved blame
of this mess onto me. While I don't think it's necessary nor important, here it
is.
I exited the capsule at Andy's, and was greeted by Johann and Shule. I
immediately asked if our message had been received. While Lily continued
trading, Johann acknowledged to me by nodding, that the messages had been
gotten. After a couple more trades, Lily waved to me in greeting. At that time,
I said, "What are your plans?"
Lily answered, "To go onto Tom Town." She went on to say, "Otherwise i'm not
discussing matters out here."
I told her that I had figured that, and Johann asked Lily if she wanted to talk
in the ship. She said yes, but first she needed to complete her trade.
I stated that this was fine, and that I would wait, at which time Johann
acknowledged me and Lily thanked me. After pleasantries, during which time
Johann mentioned that they had been expecting me cycles before, we headed into
the control room of Johann's galleon to talk. The following is an exact
transcript of our conversation.
Lily Kaise:    Have a seat.
Lily Kaise:    So Melinda do you have a letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels:   I do not, she is, um, unavailable.
Lily Kaise:    So who did she appoint to act on her behalf?
Melinda Michaels:   So we are running without either voice currently.
She nodded in response.
Melinda Michaels:   She did not appoint anybody. I took it upon myself to come
out here and make sure you guys knew.
Lily Kaise:    Well first off, I want to thank you for your efforts in traveling
out here.
Melinda Michaels:   Since she is not available, I will probably take it upon
myself to send whatever letters are needed. Somebody has to.
Lily Kaise:    Second, I want to express that I am very troubled by the news.
However, do consider that crime happens to all citizens of all alliances.
Lily Kaise:    I am not happy with what has occurred.
I nodded in response.
Lily Kaise:    Still, I am not the Military. I am not the aEU Government. My job
is to be a messenger to our Government Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and
nothing more.
Lily Kaise:    So too, did Ather Jammoa send you here?
Melinda Michaels:   Nobody sent me.
Lily Kaise:   Ok well Akemia was acting rather hysterical saying that I was
wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who wants me back there.
Melinda Michaels:   You are the voice, troubling times are at hand and here I
am.
Melinda Michaels:   We want some kind of word, people are getting upset.
Lily Kaise:   Yes but if our government felt I should be there, they have the
means to dispatch that request to me. I informed them before I left of my plans
as well.
Melinda Michaels:   So, this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?
Lily Kaise:   Even if I were there, I am not the party who can control the
behavior of AEU citizens.
Melinda Michaels:   Of course you can't.
Melinda Michaels:   So, since you weren't asked for in an official capasity, you
will remain on said trip. Is this correct?
Lily Kaise:   Well it's very much out of my hands. They need to understand that
it's not within my power to control AEU Citizens. It is our government's
responsibility to deal with those issues. You can certainly convey to them in o
uncertain terms that I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical
over-emphasasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
This typical word bothered me and it is where I began to see she was not going
to listen.
Melinda Michaels:   Okay I will do this.
Lily Kaise:   This is correct.
Melinda Michaels:   All right.
Lily Kaise:   If I were back there, there really isn't anything I could do.
Melinda Michaels:   I just hope nobody else dies.
Lily Kaise:   AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to me as well.
Melinda Michaels:   That's fine.
At this point, I stood up to get ready to leave, having felt she made herself
clear enough.
Melinda Michaels:   I tried.
Lily Kaise:   Thank you for doing so.
At this point, I was a bit frustrated because I did not feel she was going to
return, so I waved and left the control room. I stuck around outside for just a
few minutes and then headed home.
It is my position that Miss Kaise had several hours before I arrived to form a
decision as Akemi had sent the hypercast several hours earlier. Also, they knew
I was coming so she had time to write up a letter or time to ask me to wait
while she wrote something to send. Yes, I did not stay long but was told that
they were going on to Tom Town. It also appeared, by her own words, that she was
not going to change her mind since Nissi or somebody from the AEU didn't ask for
her.
In regards to me leaving quickly,, I both wanted to get home to deliver Lily's
statements and to be available in case Nissi was not yet back from the matters
in which she needed to take care of. Akemi, myself and a couple of other pilots
had discussed going ahead and writing an inquiry letter to sir Wellington if she
could not be available by Monday. Thankfully, she arrived as I was returning
home and we did not have to do this. I was not trying to rush Miss Kaise as she
had hours to decide this issue of whether or not she would return home. In my
opinion, there is no issue. When you have bad things going on at home, you get
home and deal with them because the people of our home space are more important
than gaining a few Tael.

Subject: Transcript and related to Conversation Between Melinda Michaels and
Lily Kayes and League Request for AEU Voice to Return to Comms
Author: Lily Kaise
Posted: 02:52 17 November 2316 GST
--
Date November 17, 2316
Dear Pilots,,
I am providing a statement to you below which concerns my interactions with
Melinda Michaels after she arrived on Famous Andy's Trading Post whereby she
demanded my return to Comms. In addition, i want to share my own perspective and
that I never absolutely refused to return to Comms.
I am very sympathetic to others and especially when the news related such
horrific crimes towards humanity, why, then didn't any of our own pilots support
this? It seems that they only did so when it became apparent that it was a
problem for the AEU and i didn't act immediately on Melinda Michael's request.
During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived at Famous
Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long time since we drifted off
course en route and it required about another day to get our bearings and to
correct our course. When melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would
likely want to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back in
Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to prepare a written
statement to send back via Melinda Michaels. However, I didn't get the
opportunity to ask permission to do so. I also really wasn't given time to ask
very many questions. After Melinda Michaels abruptly exited the Galleon, she
went to the Bar and so I also went to the bar. Just as I was about to ask her if
she would consider discussing the situation further with me as well as I also
wanted to prepare something in writing, she bought food and then said her
goodbyes.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda Michaels into the Control Room of the ship and the exchange
proceeded. I asked? "so Melinda do you have a letter from Nissi?" Melinda
Michaels says, "I do not, she is, um, unavailable." Melinda then says, "So we
are running without either voice currently." I nodded to Melinda. I then asked
Melinda? "so who did she appoint to act on her behalf?" "She did not appoint
anybody," Melinda says." "I took it upon myself to come out here and make sure
you guys knew." I then said to Melinda, "well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here." Melinda next said, "Since she is not
available, I will probably take it upon myself to send whatever letters are
needed". "Somebody has to." I then went further to state. "Second, I want to
express that i am very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime
happens to all citizens of all alliances. "I am not happy with what has
occurred." Melinda then nodded in agreement. I then said to Melinda. "Still, I
am not the Military. I am not the AEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to
our Government Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more." I then asked
another question? "So too, did Ather Jammoa send you here?" "Nobody sent me,"
says Melinda. I then said. "ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back in Comms so I'm just trying to understand who wants me
back there." Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice, troubling times are at hand and here I am." Melinda says, "We want some
kind of word, people are getting upset." I responded with. "yes but if our
government felt I should be there, they have the means to dispatch that request
to me. I informed them before I left of my plans as well." Melinda asked the
following which I hoped would be a good faith effort on her part to convey my
need for clarification. "So," asks Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell
people if they ask?" She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had
to say which was. "Even if i were there, I am not the party who can control the
behavior of AEU citizens." Melinda says, "Of course you can't." She continued
with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an official capasity, you will remain
on said trip," Melinda says. "Is this correct?"" I concurred by saying. 'well
it's very much out of my hands. They need to understand that it's not within my
power to control AEU Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal
with those issues. You can certainly convey to them in no uncertain terms that I
am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-emphasis on the
part of the media and related to recent elections no doubt." Melinda says, "Okay
I will do this." Melinda says, "All right." Melinda Michaels then stood up to
leave without repeating anything back to me as well as she didn't let me finish
my response. I continued by stating. "If I were back there, there really isn't
anything I could do." Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies." She
still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went on to say. "AEU
pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to me as well." "That's fine,"
says Melinda." Melinda says, "I tried." "Thank you for doing so." I said.
Melinda waved. Melinda says, "Yup." Melinda says, "Later." I waved back rather
amazed that she seemed both not interested in what I was trying to gather from
the scant information I had as well as nothing official from the leadership from
the league nor Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms. Melinda
Michaels then rather abruptly walked out of the ship. There is certainly more
that I would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a
written statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request
which didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took
time to consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the
AEU seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann
in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went
on to Tom Town to charge overnight and Johann obtained an upgrade for his
Galleon. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of
Fears the next day. I still tried to understand why I hadn't heard anything from
the AEU. There were too many unanswered questions. After a rather sleepless
night, when I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and
very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at
Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better
grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann
was very gracious and he said that he understood my concerns and that we could
return to Comms. There was also no other means aboard Johann's Galleon in the
way of a Quantum Entanglement Device to communicate that we were returning. It
is unfortunate that a hasty decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf as
I had every intention to do my job. I just felt that the League were controlling
things without the AEU's involvement. I further find it regretable that Melinda
was in so much of a hurry not to allow me to prepare a written statement which I
couldn't have prepared before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on.
I apologize to you, as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation
was in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the
plans of others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that
Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't
have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison
office.
As you can see, I never directly said that I wouldn't return. I didn't say a lot
to Johann Rowan because if his being a member of the League, there were certain
aspects which I didn't consider that he should be privy to. From my own personal
perspective. I'm not insensitive to other individuals from other alliances but
it seemed rather odd that the League were so intent on me when their own
leadership isn't performing. I so wish that Ather Jammoa would have at least
sent a statement or a request via the Hyperwave which we tried to monitor during
the times they can be typically used to transmit from the Torus. I was also not
aboard my own ship and didnt feel that i had total control over another pilot's
vessel. Johann Rowan was, however very gracious and did openly indicate that it
was my judgement call to return or not. Therefore, he is not to blame for the
delay.
I want to state that I deplore any and all acts of intimmidation, violance,
destruction of property or otherwise harm that has been inflicted upon any
individual, regardless of which Alliance, clan or where they are from. If those
acts which i have read about in the news are verifiable as a true representation
of fact, I urge the AEU to take immediate actions to seekout, prosecute and
punish those involved. No matter what has been expressed of others, I do not
hate nor wish any harm to be directed towards any human being from any part of
this universe. The AEU must absolutely uphold a zero tolerance to crimes against
humanity or any living being for that matter.

Hi Lily and Shule. I hope you enjoyed your trip.
I just, wanted to write a note for a couple of reasons, the first of them being,
ignore that lot.
You have a friend here, and that doesn't change, just because of all this crap.
The fact is, you came home in the end, and I'm glad you aren't letting the drama
tangle you up. It's not worth it.
Second, you guys, are the best, in saying that you'll keep 777 up.
I love that place more than you can imagine, and I know I also speak for Damien
Alexander, when I say that we would be happy to contribute credits, and our
help, with keeping that thing alive.
I know Nicolette likes it too, and she'd probably help, even if all the orgs are
against it.
Also, if we talk to Ather, he might sell us the other parts we need. So
hopefully, together, even if the orgs don't want in, we can keep what we enjoy
alive.
Please stay safe, and take care.
i am going out on a trip for a while, but we have a qe, so please feel free to
annoy us.
--
Eve.

I chose not to write a letter of reprimand. It is apparent that there must be
some mitigating circumstances with Demarco which affect is being able to report
to work. If I had observed his coming to work and deliberately neglecting his
felo, that's one thing. However, as tragic as it was, if there were personal
reasons why he was unable to at least report to work and find a caretaker for
his felo, then something else is the root cause. I was going to write a letter
when I returned though expressing concerns and at least asking him to update us
on his situation to the best that he could. Obviously, this is out of my hands
now so you are free to make your own judgement call. Personally, I don't believe
that being nasty or heavy-handed will win you cooperation from others and I
didn't want to further the negative relationship I have with Demarco. His lack
of performance on the job was very frustrating as well as his general lack of
attention to aspects which his experience as a pilot, far outranks ours. - Lily

Lily,
This is the copy of what I sent Ather. Just so you have it. I quoted you.
On November 13, 2316 at around 1630, I arrived at Famous Andy's trading post. I
received word that the crew of the Queen Brynn II had received the hypercasts. I
spoke with voice Kaise and received the following quotes from her.
Well first off, I want to thank you for your efforts in traveling out here.
Second, I want to express that I am very troubled by the news. However, do
consider that crime happens to all citizens of all alliances.
This was followed by, "Still, I am not the Military. I am not the AEU
Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government Liaison on behalf of
AEU pilots and nothing more."
She asked me if Ather sent me to which I replied no. She asked if Nissi had
appointed somebody to speak to her on her behalf, I said no. I told her that
there were troubling times at hand and she is the voice so here I am. I told her
that people were upset and wanting some type of word from her government. After
stating that she cannot tell AEU citizens how to behave, she went on to
reiterate, "Well it's very much out of my hands. They need to understand that
it's not within my power to control AEU Citizens. It is our government's
responsibility to deal with those issues. You can certainly convey to them in no
uncertain terms that I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical
over-emphasis on the part of the media and related to recent elections no
doubt."
I asked her if she would be returning home and was told that they are going on
to Tom Town.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.

cuffs and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

You guys matter to me, and I don't like people who cause drama, for the sake of
drama.
You're both good people, and I'm sorry Lily lost her position over this.
You've both always got a friend in me, as I said, and if I can ever help with
anything, you just have to let me know.
I was actually trying to help you guys out yesterday when Mel was going on, and
on, on general, but it appears either of you have your numbers in the directory.
I figured, I'd just call Lily and ask about the station at 285, and give her a
little support. Then I was going to take it to Mel, and screw it if she doesn't
like me helping a friend.
Anyway, I'm going away for a little while today I think, just, to get away.
We will have a qe though, as I think I mentioned, so if you guys feel alone,
just send something.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a small white trash bin, a small package, and Magellan the

lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

         Performs math operations and stores the result in a variable.  The math
         follows a C-like precedence, as follows, with the top of the list
         having the highest priority.

         True is any non-zero number, and False is zero.  Parentheses () have
         highest precedence, so inside the () is always evaluated first.
         Strings must be enclosed in " " and use regex with == and !=,
         in the case of <= and >= the alphabetic order is compared.

Example: #math {heals} {$mana / 40}
         Assuming there is a variable $mana, divides its value by 40 and stores
         the result in $heals.

Example: #action {^You receive %0 experience} {updatexp %0}
         #alias updatexp {#math {xpneed} {$xpneed - %0}
         Let's say you have a variable which stores xp needed for your next
         level.  The above will modify that variable after every kill, showing
         the amount still needed.

Example: #action {%0 tells %1}
           {#if {"%0" == "Bubba" && $afk} {reply I'm away, my friend.}}
         When you are away from keyboard, it will only reply to your friend.
#variable shotsfired 0
#OK. VARIABLE {shotsfired} HAS BEEN SET TO {0}.
#math shotsfired {$shotsfired+1}
#MATH: VARIABLE {shotsfired} HAS BEEN SET TO {1.00}.

Lily Kaise flips a high tech silver star print holovid to WJGL.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Soothing music plays as two felo
frolick in a meadow.
kiss lily
You kiss Lily Kaise.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: One of the felo leaps up, perhaps
playfully, at a Velourian sparklehawk flying low to the ground.
Lily Kaise kisses you.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A small pinpoint of light forms in
the center of the screen, accompanied by a high, keening electrical sound that
increases in volume as the light stretches into a horizontal line and then
expands to fill the screen.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Unintelligible whispers speak under
the mechanical whine, and one female voice soon rises above the rest.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Turbulence: The quality or state of
being turbulent; a disturbed state; tumult; disorder; agitation."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Hmm haven't watched this in awhile!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The voice repeats several times.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The screen flickers in a strobe-like
effect, quickly alternating between harsh white and featureless black. The
flares occur in greater strength at times, as the signal appears to be
attempting to override another.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A booming, excited voice suddenly
cuts in through the static.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "TURBULENCE HV. THIS CHANNEL. ALL
THE CHANNELS. THE KOLLER CHANNEL. KEEP WATCHING."
Lily Kaise laughs.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "OR ELSE. THE POSSE WILL COME AFTER
YOU."
chuckle
You chuckle.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A cricket bat comes into view and
crashes into the felo and the sparklehawk, sending them careening uncontrollably
through the air.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Be afraid!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera shakes a bit, as if it
were being picked up off of the ground.
-lily Are you still up for camping out this morning?
You say to Lily, "Are you still up for camping out this morning?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The viewing angle grows wider,
showing hundreds of felo, playing and eating wildlife without a concern in the
world.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An obese man wearing black and white
clown-themed greasepaint on his face walks in front of the camera,
slightly-bloodied cricket bat in hand.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The clown hits the cricket bat
against his hand, producing a hollow 'thunk' sound.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I wish I were more motivated."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in on the clown's
mouth, where his facial expression turns into a toothy grin.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera quickly zooms back out
and a counter reading '1' shows up in the bottom left corner of the holoscreen.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We do have to put up the salvage
processor which will go down in about 3 or so hours."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Post-neo-hyperthrash metal begins
playing and the clown begins running around like a maniac and knocking felo up
into the air.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The felo screech as they are knocked
up into the air.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Wow."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: After a few long moments of bashing,
the clown stops, looks at the camera, and throws up the shocker. The counter
stops at '666' and blinks readily.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Those poor felo."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A felo with a mane sits down amidst
all of the commotion and looks up at the camera, giving a single roar of
approval.
'Yeah, no kidding!
You exclaim, "Yeah, no kidding!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A female voice intones, "Welcome to
Turbulence HV, the most trusted source for nature documentaries."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Next on...The Koller Channel... is
Turbulence: Fuck Old People. Stay tuned. Or else.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera suddenly shifts frame to
two old men sitting at a table.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in on the table. A
chess game is apparently in progress.
-lily So no?
You say to Lily, "So no?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The man on the left grunts lightly,
in apparent frustration.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: His eyes suddenly light up and he
chortles an arrogant chortle.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: He reaches for a piece, apparently
ready to make a decisive move.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I guess it's more of I don't know."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A quiet, subdued note begins to
play. A spectacular image of a glowing nebula appears.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades and is replaced by
that of a pair of stars, a red giant and a white dwarf. A stream of glowing gas
connects the two.
Lily Kaise flips a high tech silver star print holovid to ISNN.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of
a generic-looking planet spinning around. "And now, the Interstellar Politics
Hour! Now condensed into one minute by popular demand!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades quickly, then
displays a newscaster seated at a desk.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening. Our topic for
tonight... the impressive victory of the National Patriots in the AEU general
election."
nod 'ok.
You nod. "Ok."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster moves some paper on
his desk and looks grim. "In an historic result Eric Best of the National
Patriots will be the 21st President of the Alliance of ExtraSolar Unions.  For
the first time in almost sixty years a single party controls the presidency, the
Senate and the House."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image changes to show shots of
celebrations across AEU worlds, from the Velourian gala attended by Best himself
to several amateur street parties on Telex. "Supporters of Best have spent no
time in showing their support of the President-elect."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image changes once again to show
Kaise Rebane shaking hands with various members of her team, looking stoic.  One
man looks close to tears.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Another image change shows Warren
Garner sitting at Green Earth HQ, staring at the floor as his wife Johanna
places her arm around his shoulder. "For some people, the result was anything
but positive."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: As the images fade to reveal the
newscaster once again, he clears his throat as an image of Old Earth next to New
Earth appears behind him.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "President Dietrich of the League of
Old Earth Democracies has contacted President-elect Best in order to
congratulate him on his victory and commented that the AEU has 'long been known
for its community spirit and history of inclusiveness', and that the League will
be more than willing to work with an administration that follows those
traditions."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Tell that to League pilots."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster is replaced by a
still image of Nina Thomas in full armor, standing in some sort of command
center filled with soldiers working at various consoles.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Space Chief Marshal of the
Confederation of Fringe Worlds Nina Thomas stated from the Battle Barge that she
is certain President-elect Best is aware of the need for careful consideration
of any decision that could affect the future of the ExtraSolar Unions."
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its
tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest
and jets off.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster reappears, shuffling
his papers.  Behind him the image of the Torus slowly rotates. "Thomas Haldeman
of the EAOS privately met with President-elect Best on Tuesday, but neither side
has yet released a public statement."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of the Torus is replaced
with that of a skim gate as the newscaster puts the papers down and glances back
at the camera.  "The Mutuality has of course not had any official diplomatic
contact with the Union for some time, but recently issued a travel advisory for
all unregistered persons to be wary of AEU ports."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The shot changes to show the
newscaster from a different angle, and he gives a brief smile. "In a surprising
move the civilian pilots of the League and Confederation, along with the
sponsored pilots of the Mutuality Ninth Fleet, released a joint statement early
this morning."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image is replaced with a
checkerboard image upon which is thick black text.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A female voice reads out the text
being projected. "We are civilian pilots. Many people have many different
opinions of us, but one thing is undeniable: every day, every cycle, we come
into contact with people from other alliances. We know these people better than
most other citizens. And we can say that we are far more alike than different.
Whether from the League, Mutuality, Fringe, AEU, EAOS, or no alliance at all,
everyone has families they care about and worries for the future. Everyone
ultimately wants to do the right thing. Less than a decade ago, all of humanity
was in a fight for its survival. That fight isn't over yet. We will succeed only
by recognizing that we're all in this together."
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its
tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest
and jets off.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The text is replaced with the
newscaster who adds, "Several high-profile Union groups have already added their
voice to supporting this statement, from the Pilot Rights party to even Custodia
Legis.  Voxel has announced that following this inspiring message he is planning
a 'Light Up the Future' tour outside AEU space. The Best Campaign could not be
reached for comment."
'I just thought that sleeping out under the stars would be calming and it didn't
take that much effort. But I understand if you're not up to it.
You say, "I just thought that sleeping out under the stars would be calming and
it didn't take that much effort. But I understand if you're not up to it."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera changes back to its
original framing of the newscaster, and he turns to face it, once again looking
stern.  "The presidential inauguration ceremony for the AEU will take place in
Velouria on January the 13th. What sort of president will Eric Best be? We shall
find out."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "That's all we have time for today.
This has been the Interstellar Politics Hour, only on ISNN!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays as the camera
slowly zooms away from the newscaster, who smiles stiffly before turning to face
someone off-camera and saying something unheard.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of
a generic-looking planet spinning around. "And now, the Interstellar Politics
Hour! Now condensed into one minute by popular demand!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades quickly, then
displays a newscaster seated at a desk.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening. Our topic for
tonight... Last night's debate, where the candidates were questioned about their
space policy and given a chance to clearly outline their differing positions.
The first such question had to do with the AEU's civilian pilot program."

Sakura, it doesn't surprise me that you are per usual taking things out of
context. The trade was already in progress before Melinda landed. I did not
initiate a new trade while Melinda was present but completed a trade. We were
only trading to kill time while waiting for Melinda's arrival so no, trading
wasn't really that important to me. I daresay that the others did more trading
that I did. As for my own alliance, nobody from the AEU seemed to be interested
in my return as they certainly didn't show up and request it over the hyperwave.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 31 October 2316 GST. Time remaining: 24
days, 3 hours, 17 minutes, and 41 seconds

Maybe it's just me, but that's when I would show some initiative and do what I
thought was right...come home. I don't know if Sakura was talking about the
trade you were currently engaged in or if she was speaking of you going on to
Tom Town. But regardless, trading was continued after you already knew the
basics of what was going on at home. I don't know Johann all that well, but if
you had been on my ship and requested we abort and return home, I would have had
no problem with that. You made your choices, now you have to live with them.

Hmm interesting well when Melinda asked me the question as she exited her
Capsule, I simply responded to her question as we hadn't discussed anything yet.
Johann is a very gracious person indeed. I have not said anything to the
contrary so leave Johann out of this. However I was not the captain and when I
made the decision to return shortly after we had landed on Tom Town, he was
asleep so I did take time out to think about the situation and what my next
course of action should be. Yes I did return a day later and a new Voice of the
Corps, Kim saunders, has been appointed. I think you need to start asking her
for a statement concerning the affairs of the AEU citizens since she was present
in comms.

Greetings everyone,
I have chosen to refrain from commenting thus far and let everyone criticise and
berate Lily over General and such. Part of the reason is that everyone knows of
my relationship with Lily and risking that nobody will listen and just read my
post as the ramblings of a love sick puppy, I will still say my piece. 
First of all, we did hear the hyper cast and Lily did affirm this to Melinda in
front of Johann and me. Second, the people who identified themselves over the
hyper cast were civilian pilots from the League. As we listened to the news
reports as they were relayed from home, everyone aboard was very disturbed by
what we were hearing. As such, we began to discuss what to do. Johann made it
clear that he would return if Lily requested. Why did she not return
immediately? Part of the reason she expressed to me was because even if she
returned home, she still felt powerless to do anything. She very well could not
pursue the criminals, begin an investigation of her own, or order the citizens
of the AEU to cease their crimes. Much as she would have loved to and still
would love to do those things, she and even our current Voice has no authority
to do so. Now, if it were a civilian pilot that had committed those acts, there
is definitely something she could have done. Secondly, she wanted to know more
information regarding her own pilot corps. 
I was not privy to the conversation between Lily and Melinda so I am not going
to attack what was said there since I wasn't there. Each has their point of
view, and you know what? If Johann or I had also attended, I'm sure there would
be even a third or fourth point of view.
*
The point is, what happened happened. She made her decision. She already faced
the consequence for making that decision. Even whether or not I agree with her
decision is irrelevant. It's easy to criticise someone in a particular situation
and say what you would do. It's another thing entirely to walk in their shoes.
So, if you all want unity, peace, love all that good stuff then I ask you one
simple question. How would you feel if you were in Lily's position. Don't tell
me that you wouldn't have made the same decision. Maybe you would have. Maybe
you wouldn't have. The point is, how would you feel if, after you were already
removed from office, and now truly powerless, to have people still questioning
events that can no longer be changed. It's up to us to move on, pick up the
pieces and truly unite if that's what is wanted. Otherwise, don't call for unity
and then berate someone of another alliance. 
One last thing, whenever I have had to interact with other civilian liaisons, I
have always had my voice present. Even when I have called for meetings with the
SDC of another alliance, I have asked for their voice and my voice to be
present. Now, maybe I was wrong in doing that, but it was always my impression
that meeting with a liaison of another alliance usually required their Voice and
my alliance Voice to be present.
So, we can keep going back and forth on the General board and probably even over
comms and accomplish what? What do you want to accomplish? You want peace? Then
fight for peace. If you want conflict, then fight for that too, but don't fight
for both. If you want to focus on the Outsiders and the IFS then let's
concentrate on that. However, it seems to me that at this point, we just want to
concentrate on the mistakes of the other alliance. Well, I supremely hope that
there isn't a large invasion tomorrow, because I doubt you all would have time
to even think two seconds about what the previous voice of the AEU did
yesterday. Having said all of that, I wish you all the best. Fly safe.

Subject: Re: my meeting with Lily re: her coming home

Greetings everyone,
I have chosen to refrain from commenting thus far and let everyone criticise and
berate Lily over General and such. Part of the reason is that everyone knows of
my relationship with Lily and risking that nobody will listen and just read my
post as the ramblings of a love sick puppy, I will still say my piece. 
First of all, we did hear the hyper cast and Lily did affirm this to Melinda in
front of Johann and me. Second, the people who identified themselves over the
hyper cast were civilian pilots from the League. As we listened to the news
reports as they were relayed from home, everyone aboard was very disturbed by
what we were hearing. As such, we began to discuss what to do. Johann made it
clear that he would return if Lily requested. Why did she not return
immediately? Part of the reason she expressed to me was because even if she
returned home, she still felt powerless to do anything. She very well could not
pursue the criminals, begin an investigation of her own, or order the citizens
of the AEU to cease their crimes. Much as she would have loved to and still
would love to do those things, she and even our current Voice has no authority
to do so. Now, if it were a civilian pilot that had committed those acts, there
is definitely something she could have done. Secondly, she wanted to know more
information regarding her own pilot corps.

Subject: Scooping Locations
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 05:55 12 October 2316 GST

Howdy, folks. The question was recently asked on comms about scooping locations.
I had not heard the question asked previously, but I do have an answer. Here is
a list of where you can scoop and when. If you have a question like this, please
ask on the boards, or if you don't get an answer, keep asking, especially if you
see long-time pilots on comms at the times.
          0-999 industry:     Jupiter
          1000-1999 industry: Omega VIII
          2000-3499 industry: Saturn
          3500-4999 industry: Tempestas
          5000-7499 industry: Olivia's Pearl
          7500+ industry:     Thousand Storms (across the skim to The Arm)

To be fair, I would have never said a word about Lily if she had not tried to
push this mistake all off on me. Therefore, I felt that I have the right to
defend my position. I was only trying to help by coming out there and do not
deserve what she has said about me.
This has nothing to do with fighting outsiders, it is a personal issue that she
tried to make public within her Alliance against me so now I have defended
myself.

you who do not know me claim it's usual for me. therefore infering that you do

To be fair, I would have never said a word about Lily if she had not tried to
push this mistake all off on me. Therefore, I felt that I have the right to
defend my position. I was only trying to help by coming out there and do not
deserve what she has said about me.
This has nothing to do with fighting outsiders, it is a personal issue that she
tried to make public within her Alliance against me so now I have defended
myself.

Hang on a moment. Theres something I clearly do not understand. This part
about "public within her alliance". If it was within her alliance, how did you
find out about it? I was always under the impression that alliance material is
just that, alliance material. Just as we're not privy to League alliance
information, how is it that you became privy to AEU alliance information? If
Lily posted something on the AEU alliance board, then clearly she meant it for
only the AEU, or are AEU, League, Fringe, Mutuality all under one roof now? So,
we all get to know what is posted on each others' boards? In that case, I can't
wait to read the League's board!

yes I would like to know how and when I have stated anything publicly Melinda.
It seems you have blown this way out of proportion from heresay. If Someone from
the aEU related to you what was posted on one of our internal message boards,
then he or she breeched alliance confidentiality. We're allowed to express
ourselves within our own ranks. So you know Melinda, you could have approached
me first before reacting to heresay. You know I am direct and I speak my mind
but you also know I am a reasonable person.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok we might as well go deploy that
station."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Lily Kaise chuckles.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock
Four).
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for docking clearance.
A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free
Worlds port."
Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
0iw{!\v90OA^sAQNvu..q0L3I7~wY-\qJE@r/sRb
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our asteroid hauling stations, fly
safe, keep an eye on your charge, and please keep eaos credits on hand for the
tolls. Have a great day!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
The two-person light transport "The Light Monkey" has fired a grapple into a
tiny asteroid.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's

forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Welcome

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,

Subject: my meeting with Lily re: her coming home
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 10:12 17 November 2316 GST
--
I have heard that I am getting the heat for Lily's delayed decision in coming
home so am going to post this brief account.
I exited the capsule at Andy's, and was greeted by Johann and Shule. I asked if
our message had been received. While Lily continued trading, Johann acknowledged
to me by nodding, that the messages had been received. After a couple more
trades, Lily greeted me. At that time, I asked, "What are your plans?" Lily
informed me that they would go on to Tom Town.
Johann allowed us to talk privately in his ship. Therefore, after she completed
her trade, we went in to discuss this.
Lily wanted to know if Ather, Nissi or another member of the AEU had sent me
there for her and I informed her nobody. That I came to make sure the messages
were received and if she was returning home. She informed me that she was deeply
troubled by what happened, however since nobody from her alliance had sent for
her, there was nothing she could do. She not once asked me for more time to
write up a statement or to think about the situation. One of the quotes that I
jotted down was, "Still, I am not the Military. I am not the aEU Government. My
job is to be a messenger to our Government Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and
nothing more."
She went on to say how Akemi was acting hystarical calling for her over the
hypercaster and that she was trying to sort out who exactly wanted her back
home. I told her that people are growing upset and wanting some answers. She
said her government could get her back if they wanted her. After making sure
these were the things that she wanted me to relate, I left. I was a little upset
at her calling situations like this typical media fotter so did leave quickly. I
wanted to get back home to relay this information and be available in case our
current voice was still tending to some things away from comm's that were of
importance to her.
It is my position that Lily Kaise had several hours before I arrived to form a
decision as Akemi had sent the hypercast several hours prior to my arrival.
Also, they knew I was coming so she had time to write up a letter or time to ask
me to wait while she wrote something to send. Yes, I did not stay long but was
told that they were going on to Tom Town. It also appeared, by her own words,
that she was not going to change her mind since Nissi or somebody from the AEU
didn't ask for her. I was not trying to rush her in any way.  In my opinion,
there is no issue. When you have bad things going on at home, you get home and
deal with them because the people of our home space are more important than
gaining a few Tael.
I hope it doesn't come to us having to do this, but will ask for a transcript of
the conversation that took place in Johann's control room if necessary.

Sakura, it doesn't surprise me that you are per usual taking things out of
context. The trade was already in progress before Melinda landed. I did not
initiate a new trade while Melinda was present but completed a trade. We were
only trading to kill time while waiting for Melinda's arrival so no, trading
wasn't really that important to me. I daresay that the others did more trading
that I did. As for my own alliance, nobody from the AEU seemed to be interested
in my return as they certainly didn't show up and request it over the hyperwave.

you really belive it not to be true?"

"Within and outside her alliance"? Which post are you referring to in which Lily
posted to make it outside her alliance. According to your first post regarding
this subject, you hear that you were getting the heat for Lily's delay. Where,
on public boards did Lily post anything of that sort, either directly or
implied? Here's the thing, Melinda. If we look at the public boards, your post
is the first one that indicates that Lily was giving you heat. No prior messages
from Lily place any blame on you. Which indicates that actually, Lily didn't
make it public outside her alliance. Prove to her and the rest of the civilian
pilots where, prior to your post, Lily made any accusation against you. I rest
my case.
