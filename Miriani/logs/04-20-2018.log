The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal 
01:40 stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

10:33 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

10:33 [Newbie] Lia Daniels: It's newbie and then your message.

10:33 [Newbie] Lia Daniels: You can't say things like that on chatter though, be careful, typing is ooc.

10:33 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: Ok, so I got a verb but can't use it with my pet. Do I have to wait a few days to use it with my pet?

10:35 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: Becuase olivia gave me a certificate and I did an action and select to change verb and yeah.

10:35 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: I think you'll get a letter telling you that your verb has been put on you pet. But that you requested it, you'll first get something with a tradesmen confirmation slip and a letter with your rquest, to make sure that's what you want.

10:35 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: I got that.

10:35 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: Okay. When it's done I think you'll get something telling you it's there. So yes you have to wait.

10:36 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: But I didn't get the letter though I just got a confermation that I made the verb.

10:36 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: Thanks olivia.

You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a small white oak wood bedside table, a beech wood king-size pillow-top bed with a blue soft patchwork quilt and fluffy pillows, a high white oak wood nightstand, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, an elegant cherry wood mirror, a white wicker wardrobe, a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces, and a pair of multi colored clogs here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (lying on a beech wood king-size pillow-top bed with a blue soft patchwork quilt and fluffy pillows) here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

22:04 You give a red handheld planetary surveyor to Jenaia the droid.

22:04 You begin the launch sequence.

22:04 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:04 The computer announces, "A planet has been detected in the sector."

22:04 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:04 [Newbie] Miriam Valleris: Just dig in that direction. To see where it is, you can also use the predict command.

22:05 #$#soundpack_pong

22:05 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: You should use predict. Predict east, predict northwest. That will tell you if the mapper thinks you're connecting up, then you just dig that direction. It doesn't connect up enters and outs, so ... Yeah.

22:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 20, 20, 20.

22:05 You will once again see all starship movement messages. (Silent mode disengaged.)

22:05 You sit down on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end.

22:08 #$#soundpack_pong

22:08 #$#soundpack_lag 215

22:08 [Newbie] Jordan Everhart: Well for example I have my garage and there are 2 exits I want. One leading outside, and the other leading to my foyar. But how do I connect it to the foyar? I done have my garage built and my foyar but there not connected.

22:09 #$#soundpack_pong

22:09 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: Yeah, it kind of gets jacked up with outs and go exits. It doesn't really work. Just make a note in that room about what room you want it connected to. Be specific, and the hosts will have to fix it.

22:09 #$#soundpack_lag 108

22:09 A fresh cloud of frozen water crystals rains down upon the room, drifting lazily down until it impacts the deck plating, where it immediately melts. Seconds later, the sound of rushing air comes somewhere from within the walls.

22:10 #$#soundpack_pong

22:10 [Newbie] Miriam Valleris: Or you just rebuild the room? Doesn't that work too?

22:11 #$#soundpack_lag 104

22:11 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: I'm not sure what you mean, but if I'm building like a wrap-around porch on a house, I can dig enter to the front door, but you can't dig an out to connect to the porch in another spot. The mapper breaks.

22:12 #$#soundpack_pong

22:12 #$#soundpack_lag 120

22:12 [Newbie] Jordan Everhart: Building the room over won't fix the problem miriam because you still will have to have the host connect the rooms where you want them leading.

22:12 [Newbie] Jordan Everhart: And yes.

22:12 The computer announces, "A planet has been detected in the sector."

22:12 [Newbie] Miriam Valleris: Yes, true. But I meant that if he just forgot to build the go exit he can destroy the room and rebuild it with tig-go or dig-enter.

22:12 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

22:12 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

22:12 Katrianne Beauchene presses a series of buttons on a sensor control board.

22:12 A planetary survey scan suddenly emerges from a console.
Katrianne Beauchene hastily retrieves it before it falls to the floor.

22:12 Katrianne Beauchene grins.

22:12 Katrianne Beauchene carefully places a planetary survey scan into a purple velvet artifact storage container.
