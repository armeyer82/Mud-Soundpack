Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your
periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy
white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the
distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, Ciera the humanoid service robot, a black upholstered sofa, a very
large and extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Desiree the little
black and white spotted CatBot, an insulated green cooler, a compact white
refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, and Kiwi the little calico
CatBot here.
Lily Kaise and Johann Rowan are sitting on a black upholstered sofa.

The scene abruptly fades.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.
A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which
hold it together.

fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

indifferent to its surroundings.

The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.
A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming
countless mouths, gasping for relief.
It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.
The curtains close, to no applause.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling
rock.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a
crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while
snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.
Agonized screams are heard within the ruptured earth as fire belches from the
open orifices. The heat from the flames propel the platform into the air!
The fires from the chasms dissipate, and the platform levels off.

it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft
black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an insulated green cooler, a compact white
refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, a small blue ball containing
a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, Ciera the humanoid service robot, and Kiwi the little calico CatBot
