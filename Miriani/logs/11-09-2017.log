[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

00:14 ["Palace of Shadow" Weapons Room 3] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable red beanbag chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret and a comfortable red beanbag chair here.
You can go west.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the eight-person gunship "Eternal Flame", and the three-person antagonizer "Primal Revenge" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Kitty the droid here.

02:07 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This 35 year old woman stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall and is thin with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a violet spacesuit jet, a pink flight control scanner, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a cute tortie cat backpack, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, a violet rolled toolkit, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a lilac snuggly, a small handheld radio receiver, a powder pink snuggly, a high-capacity pink Lore computer, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a sleek hot pink repair kit, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the six-person destroyer "Warrior Princess" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid

12:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:58 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:58 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

12:58 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:59 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:59 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

12:59 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

12:59 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

12:59 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

12:59 You press a large yellow button.

12:59 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

12:59 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:59 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

12:59 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

12:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

12:59 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, and a compact light blue cooler on wheels here.

Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, and a compact light blue cooler on wheels here.
You see Alex Mercer and Anny Rain here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

14:46 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

14:46 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "53"

14:46 ["Samma" Weapons Room 4] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a small white marble side table with twisting iron flower vines encircling the tabletop, a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a turquoise plastic cooler on wheels, and a silver trash bin here.
You can go northwest.

14:46 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "oh wait. What'd I walk in on?"

14:46 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

14:46 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:46 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:46 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

14:46 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

14:46 Anny Rain's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "you forget repair"

14:46 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

14:46 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

14:46 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Nothing. Just me not revealing how terrible I am at gunning."

14:46 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "No. Repairing is um. What the engineer is supposed to be doing."

14:47 #$#soundpack social | snicker | male

14:47 Alayna Wells giggles over the intercom.

14:47 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:47 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:47 Anny Rain's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok then"

14:47 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:47 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

14:47 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:47 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:47 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:47 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

14:47 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:47 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

14:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:47 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "It's not really like I get huge amounts of damage to begin with, really."

14:47 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

15:55 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:55 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:28 ["Saving Myself" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, a coral white floral-patterned suede love seat, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, and an internal stun turret here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

19:03 ["Saving Myself" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, a coral white floral-patterned suede love seat, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, and an internal stun turret here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

22:51 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miriani Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.
