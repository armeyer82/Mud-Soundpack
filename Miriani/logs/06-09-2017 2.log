00:00:05 Ather Jammoa says, "It was mildly alarming."

00:00:07 Morris Corlew says, "That's a name I'd never heard before."

00:00:10 Eli Grey nods.

00:00:15 Morris Corlew says, "I'd heard Gabrielle's name mentioned."

00:00:25 Ather says to Morris, "You wouldn't have if you hadn't read up archival news headlines and stuff."

00:00:29 Eli Grey says, "A lot of folks thought he was some sort of bari man, but I believe it was confirmed that it wasn't bari related."

00:00:35 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

00:00:42 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

00:00:49 Ather says to Eli, "Yeah, it was definitely the tube."

00:00:57 Ather Jammoa says, "The people who ate the flesh had their own...well."

00:01:00 Eli Grey says, "He didn't look like one at all."

00:01:00 Ather Jammoa says, "Own issues."

00:01:07 Eli Grey nods.

00:01:14 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:01:17 Eli Grey asks, "Whatever happened to that one guy.. Jerimiah I think his name was?"

00:01:18 Morris Corlew says, "I wonder what of that stuff is unrelated to bari period and just comes from other research the EAOS mighta done there."

00:01:31 Ather says to Eli, "Who knows."

00:01:55 Eli Grey says, "He looked like a straight up bari, no mistaking that."

00:01:59 Eli Grey eats a spoonful of ice cream from a cold cherry cola float then stirs the drink, blending the ice cream and beverage together.

00:02:08 Ather says to Morris, "Maybe when we clear the megapod the EAOS will finally decide to be fucking open about everything."

00:02:08 Morris Corlew asks, "Was that the one that actually ate the bari flesh?"

00:02:16 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

00:02:17 Ather Jammoa says, "A few people ate it."

00:02:20 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

00:02:25 Ather Jammoa says, "And all of them had the same kind of effect."

00:02:33 Morris Corlew says, "I'd heard about it but...not a lot of details."

00:02:36 Ather Jammoa says, "They basically transformed into part bari."

00:02:41 Morris Corlew shudders.

00:03:09 Morris Corlew says, "Interesting it makes our felo hardier against bari genetically, but transforms humans into part bari. Something to be said for differences in genetics."

00:03:27 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh yeah, vastly different genetics. I love the increase in aggression it breeds into felo."

00:03:28 You nod.

00:03:35 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:03:56 Morris Corlew says, "Mine don't seem to produce any more aggressive felo with bari flesh. Just seems to make the soldier gene stronger."

00:04:01 Eli Grey upends a cold cherry cola float and drinks the rest of the creamy beverage.

00:04:16 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, any bari flesh makes the soldier gene stronger though. We were able to determine that with relative ease."

00:04:22 Morris Corlew nods.

00:04:45 Ather Jammoa says, "That's why back in the day, when that one chunk of Grenwold was infested, we use to purposely cause infestations onto our own ships. Controlled ones that would be purposed to make our felo soldier genes stronger."

00:04:55 You say, "Makes sense."

00:05:06 Morris Corlew says, "Liam wrote that it seemed to also make the bari stronger."

00:05:14 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

00:05:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Back then the genes went away faster."

00:05:27 Morris Corlew nods.

00:05:37 Morris Corlew says, "Guess we've kinda helped the felo evolve in a way."

00:05:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Unfortunately, there is nowhere else one can purposely create controlled infestations."

00:06:02 Ather Jammoa says, "Those other ships all took off."

00:06:06 Ather Jammoa says, "They became spreaders."

00:06:13 Morris Corlew shudders. "Yeah, I've uh..."

00:06:20 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings. "Taken care of one that was."

00:06:23 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

00:06:33 Morris Corlew says, "Not from that infestation, but...a courier."

00:06:35 Ather Jammoa says, "Be happy you haven't seen the cruiser."

00:06:38 Morris Corlew nods.

00:06:51 Morris Corlew says, "I think I might have to change my boxers if I did to be honest."

00:06:51 Ather Jammoa says, "You don't want hyperbari in a ship that doesn't have a good population of felo."

00:06:56 Eli Grey asks, "Oh god.. That must have happened when I was on my little hiatus, You mean all those ships on the Grenwold chunk? the ones that were all stuck together with bari gooeyness?"

00:07:02 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

00:07:07 Morris Corlew says, "Eww."

00:07:20 Eli puts his hand on his face and says into his palm.. "fuck..."

00:07:23 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

00:07:28 Ather Jammoa pats Eli Grey on the back.

00:07:33 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

00:07:46 Morris says to Ather, "How many are there? I knew about the cruiser runnin around, but that's it."

00:07:54 Ather Jammoa sighs.

00:08:00 Ather Jammoa says, "Thanks to Peter, there are too many."

00:08:01 Eli Grey says, "I didn't have a sip there, but I remember all those ships there, it was several."

00:08:04 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

00:08:10 Morris Corlew says, "Sheesh."

00:08:21 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

00:08:23 Ather Jammoa says, "He released a bunch of spreaders, then a bunch of cargo haulers and flitters and stuff from grenwold became spreaders."

00:08:30 Ather Jammoa says, "Then there was a Mule that also ended up becoming a spreader."

00:08:42 Morris Corlew says, "That bari spreader ship I was on still gives me nightmares from time to time."

00:08:55 Eli Grey says, "Oh wait, I was around when that happened.. I just didn't realize the ships from Grenwold launched."

00:09:00 Morris Corlew says, "I'd seen it jump before I realized that's what was goin on."

00:09:07 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

00:09:25 Morris Corlew says, "So all these dreams...well most of 'em, end in that thing jumpin while I was aboard."

00:09:58 Morris Corlew says, "I kinda have a...thing about killin bari. Any opportunity...I'm happy to do it."

00:12:39 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

00:14:46 You blink heavily and then doze off.

00:19:14 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:21:19 Eli Grey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:25:10 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

00:26:11 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

00:26:26 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

00:26:35 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

00:26:37 Rogue Romano says, "Thanks Tegan."

00:26:49 Lily says to you, "Do I know you from somewhere?"

00:26:52 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:26:59 Morris Corlew looks at Lily Kaise thoughtfully.

00:27:26 You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:27:30 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

00:27:33 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

00:27:34 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

00:27:47 Lily says to you, "Welcome back!"

00:27:56 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Thanks."

00:28:04 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

00:29:15 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

00:29:31 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:29:40 Morris Corlew says, "Oooh."

00:29:44 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Planets!"

00:29:44 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

00:29:44 A readout shows Planetary System 1997-1260 about 22.81 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southeast and Very Slightly Down.
A riftstorm appears to be 1.81 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic West and Very Slightly Down.

00:29:45 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo!"

00:29:52 Eli Grey beams.

00:29:59 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo!"

00:30:01 Morris Corlew says, "Off course a bit."

00:30:06 Eli Grey says, "Someone else want to bring it in this time? I've kinda hogged it a bit the last couple of times."

00:30:17 "Anybody here that hasn't done it much?" Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

00:30:19 Eli Grey says, "I certainly don't mind, but figured I'd offer someone else a go."

00:30:32 Morris Corlew says, "I've done tons of approaches in general, so if someone else wants the practice."

00:30:40 Lily Kaise says, "I'm too lazy to and have done enough."

00:30:43 Morris Corlew laughs.

00:30:46 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:30:49 Morris says to Rogue, "How about you?"

00:30:59 Eli Grey smiles at Rogue Romano.

00:32:02 Eli Grey says, "Well.. I'll go ahead and get it started, and if anyone decides they want to just give me a tap on the shoulder."

00:32:03 Rogue Romano says, "I have not, and I'm feelin' tired."

00:32:08 Eli Grey nods to Rogue Romano.

00:32:09 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

00:32:15 Morris Corlew asks, "Mind if I get it then?"

00:32:17 Rogue Romano says, OOCly, "My connection if really iffie."

00:32:19 Eli Grey gives Morris Corlew a thumbs up!

00:32:21 Morris Corlew says, "Would love to see how these new gadgets work."

00:32:23 Morris Corlew nods.

00:32:25 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:32:27 Morris Corlew lopes south.

00:32:44 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

00:32:50 Eli Grey treks east.

00:32:53 Eli Grey treks in from the east.

00:32:59 Eli Grey says, "Gonna go check it out."

00:33:01 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

00:33:01 Eli Grey waves.

00:33:02 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

00:33:02 Eli Grey treks south.

00:33:15 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:33:16 Damien Goss sits down.

00:33:16 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:33:17 Lily Kaise glides south.

00:37:08 Rogue Romano slumps in a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow and goes to sleep.

00:37:40 Rogue Romano suddenly awakens.

00:40:05 Ather Jammoa asks, "Oh, planets again?"

00:40:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo."

00:40:16 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Aisling the Fox's neck.

00:41:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I like a fine planet."

00:41:15 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:41:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Can you survey and sphinctorgraphy at same time?"

00:41:46 Eli Grey dashes in from the south.

00:41:51 Eli Grey examines a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

00:41:56 Eli Grey makes a selection on a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of blue paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into his waiting hand.

00:42:01 Eli Grey dashes south.

00:42:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Dunno."

00:43:26 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

00:44:07 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

00:44:10 Ather Jammoa says, "I suppose you can tell them to try it."

00:44:18 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

00:44:19 Lily Kaise glides east.

00:44:37 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

00:44:41 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

00:44:43 Rogue Romano says, "Yes, both can be done at same time."

00:44:43 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sorry bout that folks."

00:44:46 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:44:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Neat."

00:44:58 Rogue Romano nods.

00:45:04 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

00:45:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says into the PA microphone, "Deploy lander probe."

00:45:23 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh."

00:45:37 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a hot cheeseburger with the works.

00:45:45 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think that's only for when we find the party planet."

00:45:49 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Depends on what kind of system it is, but probably not. We're not out to a thousand light-years yet."

00:45:57 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not even sure if she has landers on here or not."

00:46:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says into the PA microphone, "Nah, too many of the points for those."

00:46:28 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ah."

00:46:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was thinking there was one lower."

00:46:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says into the PA microphone, "Starts at 15,000, I think?"

00:47:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Possible. But I also don't know how many points Nissi has."

00:47:14 There appear to be about 21 pilots recently active.

00:47:14 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:

00:51:46 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

00:52:48 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

00:53:56 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

00:54:12 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

00:54:23 Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad it's not in here."

00:54:31 Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise.

01:09:33 The room grows a bit more chill.

01:09:34 Cheri Lindbergh waves.

01:09:36 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

01:09:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo."

01:09:42 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

01:09:42 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:09:45 Rogue Romano waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

01:09:45 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

01:09:46 Lily Kaise waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

01:09:47 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There."

01:09:49 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

01:09:49 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

01:09:51 Rogue Romano scrambles to her feet.

01:09:51 Rogue Romano slinks south.

01:09:55 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:10:00 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:10:02 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:10:03 Lily Kaise glides south.

01:10:13 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Where is everybody going?"

01:10:20 Melinda Michaels says, "To watch the scoping."

01:10:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I guess in the CR."

01:10:30 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

01:10:43 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Doing spectro and a survey."

01:10:44 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Right!"

01:10:46 Cheri Lindbergh stands up from a white leather sofa.

01:10:48 Cheri Lindbergh walks south.

01:10:52 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Man it was bein feisty."

01:11:08 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah I did check on the approach but hey never know."

01:11:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec glances around at his surroundings.

01:11:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec scrambles to his feet.

01:11:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves south.

01:11:40 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Popcorn?"

01:11:42 Melinda Michaels grins.

01:11:47 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh."

01:12:17 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone want a second image now that the original's in the box?"

01:13:43 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

01:13:43 Ather Jammoa strides south.

01:13:50 Aisling the Fox presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

01:13:55 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow. Drain rate is 68% sitting still."

01:14:03 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Nice."

01:14:07 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

01:15:30 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

01:16:16 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do we need to do something to activate the navigation thing? I never noticed you do it Mel."

01:16:25 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nevermind."

01:16:26 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Yes, hit that navigation button."

01:16:32 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I did. I have it."

01:17:16 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

01:17:56 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Party Planet detected Cheri, it looks like a giant disco ball."

01:18:10 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he laughs.

01:20:30 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

01:22:12 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

01:22:12 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

01:23:15 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

01:23:15 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

01:23:32 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

01:23:33 Aisling the Fox prances south.

01:23:33 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

01:25:04 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

01:25:15 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:25:30 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

01:25:44 Damien Goss asks, "Any good planets?"

01:27:12 Melinda Michaels says, "It's a gas giant system."

01:27:45 Damien Goss presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:27:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:27:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:27:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:27:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:27:59 Melinda Michaels presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:28:00 Damien Goss presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:28:15 The starship is not in the riftflow.

01:29:16 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:29:45 Damien Goss scrambles to his feet.

01:29:45 Damien Goss steps south.

01:30:42 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

01:30:47 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 1997-1260 I."

01:33:16 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 1997-1260 I received."

01:34:02 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

01:34:03 Damien Goss sits down.

01:34:07 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

01:34:09 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:34:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

01:34:12 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

01:34:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:34:22 Vernos Bailey sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:34:29 Vernos Bailey says, "Was cool jumping to it even."

01:34:30 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

01:34:32 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:34:42 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:34:44 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:34:46 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

01:34:48 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:34:48 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:34:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:34:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:34:55 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:34:57 The starship has left a unique area of space.

01:35:00 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

01:35:01 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

01:35:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I could have waited for the probe thing."

01:35:04 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

01:35:10 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

01:35:10 Vernos Bailey says, "But thanks nissi."

01:35:15 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:35:19 Aisling the Fox places Jason Rat on a white leather sofa.

01:35:20 Eli Grey dashes in from the south.

01:35:23 Aisling the Fox sits down on Jason Rat's lap.

01:35:39 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

01:35:42 Eli Grey exclaims, "All the science!"

01:35:43 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

01:35:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Still need to find something worth waiting on an extended probe, unless we plan on not waiting and coming back to it later. It would be possible with this mainframe computering machine, if not very convenient."

01:35:48 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:35:48 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

01:35:49 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

01:36:02 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "No problem!"

01:36:08 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

01:36:09 Ather Jammoa says, "I only got one type of probe."

01:36:14 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:36:16 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

01:36:23 Lily Kaise says, "I got three types."

01:36:25 Ather Jammoa says, "Just the extended observation and close-approach one."

01:36:27 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:36:39 Melinda says to Lily, "You have the lander too?"

01:36:44 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Lander is higher."

01:36:47 Lily Kaise says, "No."

01:36:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Is it 15,000? Or 20,000?"

01:36:57 Melinda Michaels says, "Fifteen."

01:36:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Doubt anyone qualifies for a lander."

01:37:01 Morris Corlew says, "There's a couple."

01:37:02 Lily Kaise asks, "I think that's 15K?"

01:37:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:37:06 Melinda Michaels says, "I sure don't."

01:37:21 Morris Corlew says, "Heh. I barely qualify for the first one I think."

01:37:22 Morris Corlew says, "Maybe."

01:37:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Fairly certain all pilotes have below the five digits."

01:37:32 Ather Jammoa says, "I'll break 10K soon, but depends."

01:37:35 Lily Kaise says, "A little more than half that heh so will bea long long time before I manage 15k."

01:37:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Wonder how longer it takes for landers to get that data, though."

01:38:00 Lily Kaise nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:38:15 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno, but that drain rate was pretty impressive."

01:38:18 Ather Jammoa says, "I'd wager a day or so."

01:38:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It will become more so as people adopt the higher grade of power mode saver thingies."

01:38:44 Morris Corlew nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:38:48 Vernos Bailey says, "You guys are talking numbers I can only dream of."

01:38:49 Vernos Bailey laughs.

01:38:50 Melinda Michaels says, "I can get the first one."

01:38:53 Vernos Bailey says, "I just want to get 300."

01:38:56 Lily Kaise says, "We'll make it for at least a day and a half perhaps."

01:39:00 Morris says to Vernos, "You'll make it."

01:39:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Everyone for glorious artifacting expedition."

01:39:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I bet master computer person Anfisa could bring it below fifty percent easily."

01:39:20 Lily Kaise grins.

01:39:27 Ather Jammoa says, "I've been meaning to go back to the Chamber."

01:39:32 Melinda Michaels says, "I want to go there."

01:39:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Never been."

01:39:38 Morris Corlew asks, "Chamber of Wrath?"

01:39:41 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

01:39:46 Lily Kaise says, "Same here."

01:39:49 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Me neither, but would like to."

01:39:53 Ather Jammoa says, "I've led one run there. Nissi did one too."

01:40:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That's where your museums pieces are from."

01:40:10 Morris Corlew says, "This time I'll have a hypercaster on my ship."

01:40:11 Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:40:17 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:40:22 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah... those are quite useful..."

01:40:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I could plop down a station with my galleon easy, but just one. Probably better to use a carrier."

01:40:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Glorious museum pieces."

01:40:55 Melinda Michaels says, "That's what I was planning to do. The carrier thing."

01:41:00 Vernos Bailey says, "I would totally enjoy that."

01:41:08 Melinda Michaels says, "Carrier and mod transport."

01:41:11 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah can stuff it with little teensy ships for artifacting."

01:41:11 Vernos Bailey says, "An artifacting expedition."

01:41:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Those tiny holovid ships are good for that."

01:41:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Go fast."

01:41:35 Morris Corlew nods.

01:41:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:41:41 Ather says to Vernos, "Unless you have 300 exploration by the time it left, you won't qualify."

01:41:51 Morris says to Ather, "He can hold onto them."

01:42:05 Morris says to Ather, "No reason he couldn't go and hold onto the artifacts till he could turn them in."

01:42:09 Morris glances betwen Melinda and Nissi.

01:42:14 Ather Jammoa says, "He won't even be able to leave the sector."

01:42:24 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Intra-sector artifacts."

01:42:26 Morris Corlew says, "Depends on if he shares a ship with someone."

01:42:29 Ather Jammoa says, "He needs comm override."

01:42:37 Morris says to Ather, "He could also take an org ship."

01:42:42 Melinda Michaels says, "I shared my ship with Tobias the last trip. It was fine."

01:42:42 Vernos says to Ather, "I will just have to work on artifacting when we get back."

01:42:44 Morris Corlew says, "Or, once again, share with someone."

01:42:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh. Cheatery! Yes, that'd work."

01:42:59 Melinda Michaels says, "That's not cheating."

01:42:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I think AEU person should get pre-approved before leaving comm. They are very dangerous."

01:43:01 Morris Corlew says, "It's not."

01:43:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:43:09 Melinda Michaels says, "I was on the ship with him."

01:43:14 Morris Corlew says nothing.

01:43:14 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:43:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "A flight plan, if you will."

01:43:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Listing each individual sector you plan on rifting through."

01:43:45 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "I think you need to be pre-approved to use the QE comm but we don't announce that."

01:43:50 Morris lowers his eyes and stares at a table leg.

01:43:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Your face looks like a flightplan."

01:43:56 Melinda says to Vernos, "Score."

01:43:58 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:44:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I have advanced the great cause of QE comm security."

01:44:24 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup you have."

01:44:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, Pierre is the only one who sends interesting messages."

01:44:51 Vernos Bailey says, "He is only one step from securing he can not use it."

01:44:59 Morris Corlew grins at Vernos Bailey.

01:45:21 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

01:45:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, people in expedition always complains people at home never answer things. I have given them a more proper excuse to continue not answering."

01:46:00 Lily Kaise chuckles.

01:46:10 I don't understand that.

01:46:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "My consideration for the pilotes of planets is very legendary."

01:46:13 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
A readout shows Planetary System 1997-1260 about 5.38 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Up and Slightly Westnorthwest.

01:46:29 Aisling the Fox grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:46:35 Morris Corlew says, "Pierre. A legend in his own boots."

01:46:36 Lily Kaise says, "I have little regard or sympathy for this device. Would only use it sparingly."

01:47:16 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:47:37 Morris says to Lily, "Did you get someone to set up the processor at 285?"

01:47:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I will say this, I much prefered long range of communicating when I dropped down a broadcaster next to aquarium."

01:47:44 Lily Kaise says, "I did."

01:47:47 Morris Corlew nods.

01:47:51 Morris Corlew says, "Cool."

01:47:54 Lily Kaise says, "I follow through."

01:47:57 Morris Corlew grins.

01:48:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That was pretty boss, that broadcaster."

01:48:11 Lily Kaise says, "I paid Miss Evenia well."

01:48:14 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:48:15 Morris says to Lily, "Aha."

01:48:38 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:48:42 Lily Kaise says, "I set up the lifters in a Mod transport scout so would be easy for her."

01:48:45 Morris Corlew says, "Aha."

01:48:53 Morris Corlew says, "Cool."

01:48:57 Lily Kaise nods.

01:49:16 Eli Grey asks, "Yeah, if itwas good enough for that though, say remember that time we went to a place and did a thing?"

01:49:25 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Um."

01:49:36 Lily Kaise says, "Then she has a parts list and by which org and the spare Asteroid processor is in another ship that she can access if needed."

01:49:42 Morris Corlew nods.

01:49:45 Morris Corlew says, "Cool."

01:49:46 Eli Grey asks, "Remember that time we went to a place and did a thing?"

01:49:49 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

01:49:54 Lily Kaise blinks at Eli Grey.

01:49:55 Morris says to Eli, "This time or that other time?"

01:49:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:49:59 Morris Corlew grins.

01:50:04 Eli Grey says, "It was like.. ten minutes ago, so awesome."

01:50:07 Morris Corlew laughs.

01:50:36 Morris Corlew says, "Kim has all the stuff we're responsible built and lined up ready to get crapped outta the constructor."

01:50:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Remember when launched impact probe at gassy planet?"

01:50:50 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Good times."

01:50:51 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Did the probe record the smell?"

01:50:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Probably."

01:51:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It did crash into it."

01:51:11 Damien Goss says, "Gasist, saying they have gas is rude."

01:51:15 Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:51:19 Morris Corlew gives Damien Goss a thumbs up!

01:51:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I respect their love of baked beans."

01:51:30 Vernos Bailey says, "That is pretty funny."

01:51:36 Damien Goss grins. "I couldn't resist."

01:51:37 Eli Grey says, "Farting in your general direction is just how they say hello."

01:51:43 Vernos Bailey asks, "Maple baked bean?"

01:51:44 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:51:49 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

01:51:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yes."

01:52:02 Morris Corlew says, "Language based on smell."

01:52:04 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:52:07 Morris Corlew says, "Smelly."

01:52:39 Damien Goss sniffs at himself.

01:52:49 Damien Goss says, "I must be communicting contentment."

01:52:54 Morris Corlew sniffs at Damien Goss. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

01:52:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Would be interesting to smell that language."

01:52:59 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

01:53:15 Morris says to Damien, "I recognize that scent, but...can't place it. And...sorry to get in your personal space there."

01:53:16 Damien wave a hand at Morris.

01:53:16 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

01:53:25 Damien Goss says, "Whoa dude, too familiar."

01:53:31 Morris says to Damien, "Sorry man."

01:53:38 Vernos Bailey laughs.

01:53:59 Cheri Lindbergh glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

01:54:01 Anfisa of Marzore says, "It already exists. One's own natural pheromones influence your actions, regardless of your desire."

01:54:10 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:54:37 Eli says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Sometimes,  they coincide with desires."

01:54:45 Eli Grey grins.

01:54:56 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Only because they influence your subconscious."

01:55:55 Morris Corlew says, "But to be able to control your own pheromones and understand those of others...would be rather interesting."

01:56:14 Vernos Bailey says, "It would."

01:56:25 Anfisa of Marzore says, "You already do. That is why they have an effect on you."

01:56:34 Morris Corlew says, "I mean consciously though."

01:57:57 Lily Kaise nods to Morris Corlew.

01:58:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "If you stink, you act like stink!"

01:58:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:58:31 Morris Corlew says, "Subconsciously we produce pheromones, subconsciously we react to the pheromones of others, but...we don't consciously interpret them or produce them at will."

01:58:50 Morris Corlew says, "For it to be in the conscious mind as language is, would be something pretty neat."

01:59:28 Damien Goss says, "I think one of the major drawbacks to that is that human sense of smell isn't all that good."

01:59:35 Morris Corlew nods.

01:59:43 Damien Goss says, "So it probably won't ever come to a concious level."

01:59:57 Morris Corlew says, "Possibly if it was more developed, we mighta developed how we produce and react to pheromones."

02:00:12 Morris Corlew says, "Maybe with a couple million more years of evolution."

02:00:13 Morris Corlew shrugs.

02:01:07 Aisling the Fox sniffs at herself.

02:01:15 Vernos Bailey sniffs at himself.

02:01:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Yup I smell good."

02:01:30 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Sniffers."

02:01:37 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:01:54 Rogue Romano says, "I don need to sniff. I showered when I woke."

02:01:54 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

02:02:00 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Is there a reason we're at 75 trim?"

02:02:16 Vernos Bailey says, "Good question."

02:02:22 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

02:02:22 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

02:02:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Whoops, somebody forgot to fix it."

02:02:28 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

02:02:29 Morris Corlew says, "I did."

02:02:30 Morris Corlew sighs.

02:02:34 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

02:02:34 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Sorry about that."

02:02:35 Damien Goss exclaims, "Bad Morris!"

02:02:36 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

02:02:38 Morris Corlew nods.

02:02:47 Vernos Bailey pats Morris Corlew on the back.

02:02:53 Rogue Romano grins.

02:02:56 Morris says to Nissi Valdaire, "Sorry, it kept gettin away from me and with everybody up there was hard to get to the controls and it slipped my mind."

02:03:01 Nissi Valdaire nods.

02:03:04 Rogue Romano finishes off a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

02:03:18 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:03:26 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:03:51 Vernos Bailey says, "I am really hoping for a rocky planet before this awesome trip comes to an end."

02:04:03 Morris Corlew crumples up his sheet of blue paper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

02:04:10 Damien Goss says, "We've still got quite a ways to go."

02:05:21 Vernos Bailey asks, "What was it, like 300 lightyears until 1000?"

02:05:22 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:05:30 Morris says to Vernos, "235 or so."

02:05:34 Vernos Bailey nods.

02:06:04 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm less than 250."

02:06:16 Morris says to Lily, "Yep."

02:06:40 Vernos Bailey says, "I will be honest, the flow has been great."

02:06:47 Morris Corlew nods. "It has."

02:06:52 Vernos Bailey says, "I thought it would take us a long time to get to 1000."

02:06:59 Morris says to Vernos, "It does sometimes."

02:07:08 Lily Kaise says, "I sure hope 1000 isn't a firm number but hey, if it is, it's awesome."

02:07:12 Lily Kaise grins.

02:07:16 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:07:59 Lily Kaise says, "Hard call though because we've been very lucky with the flow and it could really turn lousy on us."

02:08:08 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

02:08:16 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."

02:08:29 Morris Corlew says, "Can't see Nissi hittin a thousand and turnin around to be honest."

02:08:35 Lily Kaise says, "Nope."

02:08:38 Lily Kaise grins.

02:09:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Grab up the lizards and spiders and hang on with whatcha got!"

02:09:11 Vernos Bailey says, "I don't know any of you well enough to judge that."

02:09:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:09:38 Eli Grey says, "Nah, we're prety close to a thousand in my opinion, and we haven't even recharged yet."

02:09:50 Morris says to Vernos, "What, that we'd turn around at 1K?"

02:09:58 Eli Grey says, "Definintely don't see us turning around at a thousand at all."

02:10:06 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

02:10:37 Lily Kaise says, "We'll certainly have a better opportunity to find more rare objects the farther we go out."

02:10:41 Morris Corlew says, "Generally the point is to go out as far as ya can keepin charge to get home in mind. Not a specific turnaround point."

02:10:43 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

02:10:46 Lily Kaise nods.

02:10:52 An orange digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

02:11:04 Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:11:05 Nissi Valdaire says, "We're gonna push range as much as we can."

02:11:34 Lily Kaise gives Nissi Valdaire a high five and hugs Nissi Valdaire.

02:11:56 Melinda Michaels says, "I got 1300 out of my science vessel with none of these upgrades. We should be able to hit 15 or 1600 easy."

02:11:59 Vernos Bailey says, "Sounds nice to me."

02:12:07 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

02:12:37 Anfisa of Marzore says, "If you want to hit 1000 lightyears and turn around, just use a scout or exploration-loaded terroreroticist. Waste of a good ship to do so otherwise."

02:12:42 Melinda Michaels asks, "Cause it has, over a day more charge?"

02:12:47 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:12:54 A sudden shift in gravity pulls you down as the hovertruck rises into the air to travel over a perpendicular highway.

02:13:06 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

02:13:06 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

02:13:15 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

02:13:16 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

02:13:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "About two days left."

02:13:25 Eli Grey exclaims, "Cross the infinite ocean!"

02:13:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "So we'll hit 1000 before a recharge easy unless we hit rift doldrums or something."

02:13:47 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:13:56 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:14:09 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, plenty of charge to play with."

02:14:38 Damien Goss asks, "You have the impeller, right?"

02:15:53 Morris Corlew says, "I think this thing has everything but...uh...long-range NDB, targeting computer and...Outsider and thrall databases."

02:16:14 Morris Corlew says, "I drool when I read that status in engineering."

02:16:15 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:16:38 Damien Goss says, "I got a headache."

02:16:52 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:20:14 Rogue Romano glances down at her platinum watch with a round face momentarily.

02:21:16 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:23:04 Two skeletons riding skeletal horses draw alongside the hovertruck bed briefly and stare across at you, blue points of light glittering in their empty eyesockets.

02:27:52 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:33:46 A single snowglobe zips up to the hovertrailer and circles you once before continuing on.

02:34:02 Morris grins at the snowglobe as it passes.

02:34:19 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:34:19 A readout shows Planetary System 1997-1260 about 1.41 light-trade cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Up.

02:35:55 Ather Jammoa slumps in a white leather sofa and goes to sleep.

02:37:21 Rogue Romano yawns.

02:37:31 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

02:37:37 Morris Corlew says, "Sheesh."

02:37:41 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

02:37:52 Rogue Romano asks, "Hmm?"

02:39:17 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:41:56 Morris Corlew says, "Hovertruck accident."

02:42:40 Rogue Romano says, "Oh."

02:51:52 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:53:16 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:57:04 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:57:05 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

03:05:18 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

03:06:24 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

03:07:33 There is a sudden squeak from somewhere inside the starship, cut off with a crunch and the sound of scuttling legs.

03:07:37 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:09:11 Aisling the Fox asks, "What?"

03:09:19 Morris Corlew says, "Somebody stepped on somethin."

03:09:20 Morris Corlew shrugs.

03:09:31 Aisling the Fox asks, "You mean squeak?"

03:09:34 Morris Corlew nods.

03:09:34 Aisling the Fox says, "Spiders."

03:09:36 Morris Corlew says, "And crunch."

03:09:37 Lily Kaise picks up a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

03:09:53 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:10:01 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:10:06 Lily Kaise puts down a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

03:10:12 Morris Corlew looks at Lily Kaise thoughtfully.

03:10:16 Lily Kaise says, "I almost gave that to tegan."

03:10:21 Morris Corlew asks, "Why not?"

03:10:33 Morris Corlew says, "Oh..."

03:10:34 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:10:37 Lily Kaise asks, "Because perhaps Pierre likes it?"

03:11:09 Lily Kaise chortles.

03:11:18 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:11:40 Lily Kaise says, "It's a good thing I recognized the hand-writing."

03:12:15 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise and chuckles.

03:12:20 Lily Kaise grins.

03:17:24 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:17:48 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

03:20:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Spiders and silk."

03:20:39 Morris Corlew nods.

03:21:33 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:21:34 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:21:39 Aisling the Fox says, "Silky spiders."

03:21:46 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:21:50 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

03:21:54 Lily Kaise glides east.

03:22:09 Aisling the Fox stands up from Jason Rat's lap.

03:22:11 Aisling the Fox prances east.

03:22:11 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:22:16 Aisling the Fox prances in from the east.

03:22:16 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:22:18 Aisling the Fox dangles a mound of hot chicken-flavored rice in a small bowl in front of a Tardick lizard named Thor. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

03:22:21 Aisling the Fox sits down on Jason Rat's lap.

03:22:54 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

03:22:59 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:26:12 Morris Corlew says, "Hungry lizard."

03:26:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

03:27:18 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:27:57 You glance around at your surroundings.

03:28:06 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:28:10 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:28:12 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:28:13 The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't be felt.

03:28:17 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:29:54 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:29:59 Rogue Romano says, "I'm goin' to rest. Try to rid this damn headache I got."

03:30:03 Melinda Michaels nods to Rogue Romano.

03:30:05 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

03:30:06 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Romano. "Rest well."

03:30:08 Aisling the Fox waves to Rogue Romano.

03:30:13 Rogue Romano nods and waves.

03:30:15 Rogue Romano slinks south.

03:30:17 I don't see that here.

03:31:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:35:01 Ather Jammoa suddenly awakens.

03:37:16 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:37:20 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

03:37:24 Aisling the Fox

03:37:24 She appears to be 34 years old. She is about six feet and two inches tall and has freckled skin. Her body is lithe with bony hips and thin calves. She has slender shoulders and a small bust. Her face is mousey, heavily-freckled, and girlish, with a button nose and round chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are green and round. Her ankle-length, frizzy hair is fiery red and hanging in a single braid. She has bitten pale fingernails. She has a shimmering green and gold shamrock in her hair.
Her face is tattooed with a delicate band of green labyrinthian knotwork, consisting of several overlapping and swirling cords, that stretches from ear to ear and across the bridge of her nose.
 She is wearing a white pointelle beret, a cute little plush calico cat with brilliant green eyes, an intricately designed charcoal gray shipsuit, and a pair of scuffed old boots. She is also wearing a solid silver ring engraved with intricate Celtic knots, a matte orange oxide wrist-mounted chronometer, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a worn and tattered brown leather satchel, a black digital felo game, an orange touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a rune-carved and lac
03:37:24 quered rowan wood keychain, an orange vibro-baton, and a Tardick lizard named Thor perched on her shoulder. Her face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

03:37:28 Morris Corlew says, "Woo. Stormy storm."

03:37:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

03:37:41 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:37:41 A riftstorm appears to be 2.94 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northeast.

03:37:55 You nod.

03:38:51 An insectile chittering echoes from the distance.

03:39:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Perhaps we will go into storm, perhaps not."

03:39:08 Morris Corlew nods.

03:39:11 You nod.

03:39:12 Morris Corlew says, "We've missed most of 'em."

03:40:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Insufficient faith in rift plush cat, perhaps."

03:40:06 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "We are steadily drawing closer to it!"

03:40:23 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Very slowly, but steadily!"

03:40:25 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

03:40:35 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

03:40:36 Lily Kaise winks at you.

03:41:50 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

03:41:51 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

03:41:53 Morris Corlew sighs.

03:41:54 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

03:41:55 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:41:59 Morris Corlew says, "I got it."

03:42:00 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:42:04 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

03:42:07 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:42:07 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

03:42:11 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repairs repairs."

03:42:13 Damien Goss stands up.

03:42:14 Lily Kaise removes a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:42:19 Damien Goss steps south.

03:42:21 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

03:42:23 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:42:24 You can't go that way.

03:42:25 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]

03:42:25 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

03:42:26 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Command Ring; Navigation Mainframe]

03:42:26 You can go northeast, northwest, and down.

03:42:27 You can't go that way.

03:42:29 You can't go that way.

03:42:32 Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go northeast, northwest, and down.

03:42:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "3.33LTC by the way."

03:42:34 Lily Kaise glides northwest.

03:42:34 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Command Ring; Starboard]

03:42:34 You can go southwest and northwest.

03:42:34 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Control Room]

03:42:34 You see a gray leather captain's chair, a white leather sofa with a black throw pillow and a dark purple throw pillow on it, a black storage locker, and a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images' here.
You can go southeast, southwest, up, and out.

03:42:35 Lily Kaise glides in from the southwest.

03:42:37 You remove a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger from a leather briefcase.

03:42:39 You remove a hyperspanner from a leather briefcase.

03:42:40 Lily Kaise removes spacesuit components from a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side and quickly dons them.

03:42:40 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Airlock]

03:42:41 You see a row of flightlockers and a large secure xenology storage container here.
Morris Corlew and Damien Goss are standing here.
You can go enter into the ship.

03:42:42 Lily Kaise glides in.

03:42:44 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Anyone else coming out?"

03:42:45 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

03:42:45 [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:42:46 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

03:42:49 Lily Kaise removes a hyperspanner from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:42:54 Morris Corlew nods.

03:42:56 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Inside."

03:42:58 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Stepping out."

03:42:59 Morris Corlew presses a large button marked CYCLE.

03:43:02 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

03:43:02 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm headin' to engineerin'"

03:43:03 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

03:43:05 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ok."

03:43:08 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

03:43:09 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

03:43:10 [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:43:10 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

03:43:11 Lily Kaise carefully opens the hatch and floats outside, into deep space.

03:43:11 [Outside Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles]
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles.
You are weightless here.
You carefully open the hatch and float outside.

03:43:11 Damien Goss emerges from the imperator "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles".

03:43:11 I don't understand that.

03:43:12 Morris Corlew emerges from the imperator "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles".

03:43:12 Morris Corlew floats over to a small exterior panel, lifts it, and begins discharging energy to prime a zero-point energy receptacle.

03:43:13 Damien Goss floats over to a small exterior panel, lifts it, and adjusts a riftsail alignment node with his hyperspanner.

03:43:13 Lily Kaise floats over to a small exterior panel, lifts it, and adjusts a riftsail alignment node with her hyperspanner.

03:43:14 You float over to a small exterior panel, lift it, and begin discharging energy to prime a zero-point energy receptacle.

03:43:44 (30 seconds roundtime.)

03:43:45 Damien Goss floats over to a small exterior panel, lifts it, and begins discharging energy to prime a zero-point energy receptacle.

03:43:45 External repairs appear to be complete!

03:43:49 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

03:43:50 Morris Corlew says, "Wow."

03:43:52 Wait 22 seconds.

03:43:59 Wait 15 seconds.

03:44:03 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

03:44:03 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

03:44:04 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

03:44:04 Morris Corlew asks, "Why is it cycling?"

03:44:09 Wait 5 seconds.

03:44:10 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:44:14 That ship's airlock is cycling and you are unable to enter.

03:44:15 Some lights on the imperator "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles" flash as Lily Kaise boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

03:44:16 Some lights on the imperator "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles" flash as Damien Goss boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

Lily Kaise and Damien Goss are standing here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the imperator "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

03:44:18 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

03:44:19 Morris Corlew just boarded the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:44:24 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:44:28 Morris Corlew nods and nods and nods.

03:44:29 Morris Corlew presses a large button marked CYCLE.

03:44:30 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

03:44:32 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

03:44:32 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

03:44:33 Morris Corlew says, "That was weird."

03:44:33 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are we making repairs?"

03:44:36 Damien Goss puts a hyperspanner in a black leather gadget bag.

03:44:36 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "We were."

03:44:37 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

03:45:30 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

03:45:32 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

03:45:33 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

03:45:35 Ather Jammoa puts a hyperspanner in a midnight blue backpack.

03:48:37 Sarah Bellamy beams.

03:48:57 Morris says to Sarah, "Had food yet?"

03:49:11 Sarah Bellamy says, "NOpe I literally just woke up while you guys were repairing."

03:49:21 Morris Corlew nods.

03:49:41 Sarah Bellamy says, "SO I should remedy that."

03:49:45 Sarah Bellamy examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

03:49:47 Morris Corlew grins.

03:49:48 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Sarah Bellamy removes a small round personal taco pizza from the open compartment.

03:49:54 Sarah Bellamy scrambles to her feet.

03:49:54 Sarah Bellamy bebops east.
Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:05:07 Sarah Bellamy waves to you. "I didn't know you were with us. Hi."

04:05:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:05:21 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:05:33 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah I think I still know this guy!"

04:06:18 I don't understand that.

04:06:21 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:06:29 Sarah Bellamy says, "I seriously had no clue he was on board."

04:06:32 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

04:17:04 Morris Corlew says, "I...don't want a stray bullet."

04:17:06 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

04:17:13 Sarah nods slowly.

04:18:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Morris worries too much."

04:19:01 Aisling the Fox says, "Ants, bullets."

04:19:09 Aisling the Fox says, "Like either of these things ever killed someone."

04:19:13 Aisling the Fox grins.

04:19:15 Sarah Bellamy chuckles.

04:19:42 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]

04:19:42 This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air, thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

04:19:43 Morris says to Aisling, "Projectile weapons used to be a thing on Old Earth. Killed many, many folks."

04:19:55 A black digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

04:20:09 Aisling the Fox says, "Not used to."

04:20:16 Aisling the Fox says, "Used not so long ago."

04:20:21 Morris Corlew nods.

04:20:29 Aisling the Fox says, "And used on battlesuits."

04:21:03 Morris Corlew says, "Been laws about it for awhile there. I don't know about elsewhere."

04:26:23 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:26:47 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:26:59 Morris closes his eyes.

04:27:30 Sarah Bellamy gives a bottle to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:31:19 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:36:10 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

04:44:46 Vernos Bailey picks up a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

04:45:07 Vernos Bailey says, "Ather."

04:45:18 Morris says to Vernos, "Lily's the litterer."

04:45:20 Morris Corlew glances at Lily Kaise.

04:45:28 Morris says to Vernos, "She just wanted to share the news."

04:45:30 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:45:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh it was already on the deck!"

04:45:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:45:48 Lily Kaise says, "I picked it up and was going to give it to Tegan."

04:45:51 Vernos Bailey says, "Well the bot will not acceot it."

04:45:56 Vernos Bailey says, "Accept I mean."

04:46:00 Lily Kaise says, "Then I looked at it."

04:46:07 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:46:08 Lily Kaise says, "And read it hehe."

04:46:15 Sarah Bellamy asks, "It says something?"

04:46:22 Vernos Bailey gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:46:27 Vernos Bailey says, "There we go."

04:46:27 You can't read a royal blue and gold duratex wrapper.

04:46:27 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

04:46:43 Ather Jammoa suddenly awakens.

04:47:02 Morris Corlew says, "Looks like the bot accepted it."

04:47:11 Ather Jammoa examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

04:47:13 Vernos Bailey says, "Your bot was briefly rejecting the trash I wanted to give it."

04:47:39 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

04:47:44 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Ather Jammoa removes a small round personal three-meat pizza from the open compartment.

04:47:49 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

04:48:13 Ather Jammoa takes a bite of a small round personal three-meat pizza.

04:48:19 Vernos Bailey asks, "We going to miss that storm?"

04:48:24 Sarah Bellamy says, "I don't know if we went from bad to worse or what."

04:48:24 Ather Jammoa says, "A grand pizza."

04:49:30 Melinda Michaels says to Vernos, "A bit early to tell for sure."

04:49:48 Vernos Bailey nods.

04:49:50 Ather Jammoa examines a small hot chocolate dispenser robot for a moment.

04:50:04 Ather Jammoa presses a shiny red button on a small hot chocolate dispenser robot and helps himself to a small cup of steaming minty hot chocolate.

04:50:27 Ather Jammoa says, "Pizza and hot chocolate woo. I'm grand rebel."

04:50:41 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a small cup of steaming minty hot chocolate.

04:50:45 Vernos Bailey laughs.

04:50:53 Vernos Bailey examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

04:51:01 Vernos Bailey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

04:51:07 Morris Corlew says, "Nothing wrong with that combination to me."

04:51:11 Vernos Bailey examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

04:51:20 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "The robot!"

04:51:24 Vernos Bailey examines a small hot chocolate dispenser robot for a moment.

04:51:30 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:51:33 Vernos Bailey presses a shiny red button on a small hot chocolate dispenser robot and helps himself to a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:51:36 Ather Jammoa takes a bite of a small round personal three-meat pizza.

04:51:40 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a small cup of steaming minty hot chocolate.

04:51:47 Vernos Bailey says, "Hmm this should be interesting."

04:52:07 Sarah says to Vernos, "You got guts. I"ve not been brave enough to try that."

04:52:14 Vernos Bailey takes a sip of a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:52:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Hmm. I should make this combination a new trend."

04:52:33 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Tegan is friend to all."

04:52:41 Morris Corlew says, "It's good."

04:52:45 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Especially discarded wrappers."

04:52:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yes."

04:52:46 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe I'll invite President Best of the Best to lunch."

04:52:50 Vernos scrunches his face a little and squeezes his eyes a bit as the flavor covers his pallet.

04:52:52 Morris Corlew says, "Oy."

04:52:58 Morris Corlew examines a small hot chocolate dispenser robot for a moment.

04:52:59 Morris Corlew presses a shiny red button on a small hot chocolate dispenser robot and helps himself to a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:53:02 Morris Corlew quickly drains a glass of cold lemonade.

04:53:08 Morris Corlew gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:53:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Could be better."

04:53:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Tegan is friend to discarded wrappers?"

04:53:19 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:53:36 Vernos Bailey takes a sip of a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:53:51 Vernos Bailey says, "It is drinkable but not sure I would repeat."

04:54:04 Ather Jammoa says, "Aww you gave her the wrapper? I hate you."

04:54:15 Vernos Bailey says, "I gave her the wrapper."

04:54:15 Ather Jammoa says, "It was supposed to be superfixture."

04:54:17 Morris says to Ather, "Pierre only smells when he inhales."

04:54:24 Morris inhales deeply.

04:54:26 Morris Corlew says, "I smell too."

04:54:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I will go get gift."

04:54:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec scrambles to his feet.

04:54:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves south.

04:54:51 Vernos Bailey takes a sip of a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:54:54 Vernos Bailey takes a sip of a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:54:56 Vernos Bailey finishes off a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:55:02 Vernos Bailey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:55:06 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Noooo!"

04:55:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

04:55:11 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Not the baked beans!"

04:55:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I am discarding a wrapper."

04:55:18 Morris Corlew laughs.

04:55:18 Vernos Bailey laughs.

04:55:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec gives a royal blue and gold duratex wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:55:22 Ather Jammoa sighs.

04:55:23 Morris Corlew says, "Now Pierre will smell for sure."

04:55:24 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:55:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa.

04:55:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Somebody always got to be spoiling the fun."

04:56:26 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

04:56:27 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

04:56:41 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

04:56:42 Morris inhales the steam from a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

04:56:54 Vernos Bailey says, "I shall have stinkest of all farts."

04:56:57 Vernos Bailey points at a wrapped egg salad sandwich.

04:57:23 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:57:33 Vernos Bailey carefully unwraps an egg salad sandwich.

04:58:02 Vernos Bailey says, "Whole deck will have an odor."

04:58:09 Ather Jammoa takes a bite of a small round personal three-meat pizza.

04:58:14 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a small cup of steaming minty hot chocolate.

04:58:25 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:58:32 Vernos Bailey picks up half of an egg salad sandwich and takes a huge bite.

04:58:59 Sarah glances around in confusion.

04:58:59 Aisling the Fox sniffs at herself.

04:59:03 Sarah Bellamy absently sniffs at the air.

04:59:06 Aisling the Fox says, "I smell good."

04:59:07 Sarah Bellamy sniffs at herself.

04:59:13 Sarah Bellamy says, "Me too."

04:59:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Will move through vents and into quarters so no one is safe."

04:59:18 You sniff absently at the air.

04:59:26 Vernos Bailey says, "From the smell."

04:59:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Vernos, let me borrow that wrapper when you're done."

04:59:38 Sarah Bellamy says, "I still don't know what smell we're trying to avoid."

04:59:39 Ather Jammoa takes a bite of a small round personal three-meat pizza.

04:59:40 Morris says to Melinda, "Any idea if this ship has a brig hidden somewhere?"

04:59:41 Morris Corlew grins.

04:59:47 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:59:48 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a small cup of steaming minty hot chocolate.

04:59:51 Vernos Bailey takes another large bite of an egg salad sandwich.

05:00:06 Morris says to Sarah, "Vern eating eggs and Pierre eating beans."

05:00:09 Vernos says to Morris, "Smell will seap from brig."

05:00:10 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:00:11 Melinda says to Morris, "I thought you carried that around."

05:00:16 Morris says to Melinda, "A brig?"

05:00:19 Morris Corlew shakes his head.

05:00:25 Vernos Bailey finishes off half of an egg salad sandwich.

05:00:29 Morris says to Melinda, "Unless we got a tent and guarded it."

05:00:30 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

05:00:54 Morris Corlew says, "Lock 'em both in there and they can stink themselves out till it's all outta their systems."

05:01:01 Lily Kaise says, "Yech."

05:01:05 Ather Jammoa finishes off a small round personal three-meat pizza.

05:01:09 Ather Jammoa finishes off a small cup of steaming minty hot chocolate.

05:01:19 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

05:01:21 Ather Jammoa gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

05:02:11 Melinda says to Morris, "Could be one of those sex tents."

05:02:21 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

05:03:05 Morris Corlew says, "Pierre and Vern in...a sex tent, farting each other silly."

05:03:06 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

05:03:13 Morris Corlew says, "That's not...an image I wanna think about."

05:03:23 Sarah Bellamy says, "Nuh uh."

05:03:30 Melinda Michaels smirks.

05:05:01 Morris Corlew asks, "Do those...circulate their own air?"

05:05:02 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

05:05:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I did not eat any beans at this time."

05:05:10 Morris Corlew gives Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec a thumbs up!

05:05:21 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

05:05:23 Sarah Bellamy gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

05:05:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Tegan likes wrapper, I gave Tegan a wrapper."

05:05:54 Morris Corlew laughs.

05:08:34 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

05:08:47 Sarah Bellamy says, "Eeew."

05:09:40 Morris says to Sarah, "Are you ewwing at my hot chocolate?"

05:09:49 Sarah Bellamy says, "Yes."

05:09:53 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

05:09:54 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:09:54 Morris Corlew gasps at Sarah Bellamy.

05:10:02 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:11:43 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm. Still getting closer."

05:14:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Kind of slowly."

05:14:25 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:14:28 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Well, yes. Is in basically same direction."

05:14:42 Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:15:14 Vernos Bailey starts in on the second half of an egg salad sandwich.

05:15:59 Morris Corlew nods.

05:16:02 You say to Lily, "You getting sleepy?"

05:16:13 Lily Kaise nods.

05:16:23 Lily Kaise says, "I'll just hangout here with you though."

05:16:30 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Ok."

05:16:33 Vernos Bailey takes another large bite of an egg salad sandwich.

05:16:52 Vernos Bailey says, "I will give glorious wrapper to bot."

05:17:13 Vernos Bailey finishes off the last of an egg salad sandwich.

05:17:40 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

05:17:43 Vernos Bailey gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

05:21:51 Morris says to Vernos, "What's so glorious about it?"

05:22:21 Vernos Bailey says, "I ate what was in the wrapper."

05:22:34 Sarah Bellamy examines an emerald green ice cream dispenser for a moment.

05:22:44 Sarah Bellamy presses a gold button on the front of an emerald green ice cream dispenser. The contraption hums and gurgles for a moment; then the noise dies away, and a cold cherry cola float is deposited into the dispensing area in the front, which she promptly retrieves.

05:22:57 Morris says to Vernos, "You eating is glorious?"

05:23:11 Morris scratches his head and grins at Vernos.

05:23:19 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

05:23:29 Vernos Bailey says, "No me eating what was in the wrapper makes the wrapper glorious because I choose the wrapper."

05:23:40 Morris Corlew frowns.

05:23:46 Morris Corlew asks, "Uhm...ok?"

05:23:56 Vernos Bailey asks, "Hm?"

05:24:25 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Nothin."

05:24:28 Vernos Bailey says, "You have confused me with your frown."

05:24:52 Sarah Bellamy frowns.

05:25:02 Sarah Bellamy says, "You confuse me with everything you just said."

05:25:21 Morris Corlew grins at Sarah Bellamy.

05:25:33 Vernos Bailey says, "The wrapper is glorious because I choose to eat it's contents."

05:25:38 Vernos Bailey says, "It became the."

05:25:41 Vernos Bailey says, "It became the."

05:25:50 Vernos Bailey says, "It became the "choosen wrapper""

05:25:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah that's it."

05:26:04 Morris Corlew says, "Chosen wrapper..."

05:26:15 Morris says to Vernos, "Are you ok? Running a fever or somethin?"

05:26:22 Morris says to Vernos, "Rift getting to you?"

05:26:23 Vernos Bailey laughs.

05:26:27 Vernos Bailey says, "Nah."

05:26:40 Vernos Bailey says, "It made sense in my head."

05:26:41 Sarah Bellamy says, "Well somethin's fucked up somewheres."

05:26:47 Morris says to Vernos, "That's kind the point..."

05:26:48 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

05:27:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I think I just might be tired."

05:27:05 Vernos Bailey glances down at his tasteful gold watch with diamond accents momentarily.

05:27:09 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah maybe that is it."

05:27:14 Sarah Bellamy says, "Possibly."

05:27:53 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

05:28:05 Morris peers upward at the creature flying overhead.

05:30:53 Aisling the Fox says, "That riftstorm is looking really stormy."

05:32:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is possible."

05:33:18 Morris Corlew says, "Mmhmm."

05:35:19 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

05:38:01 Morris Corlew says, "Comin at us pretty fast."

05:38:20 Aisling the Fox says, "Scary."

05:38:20 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

05:38:30 Morris Corlew says, "Teleport us 300 light-years out."

05:39:05 Aisling the Fox laughs.

05:39:06 Aisling the Fox says, "No."

05:39:07 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh yeah. It's coming quick."

05:39:31 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's what she said."

05:39:37 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "HA HA IS JOKE!"

05:39:39 Aisling the Fox gives Nissi Valdaire a high five.

05:39:41 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

05:39:50 Nissi Valdaire beams.

05:39:50 Sarah Bellamy grins at Nissi Valdaire.

05:40:02 Vernos Bailey grins.

05:40:46 Eli rubs his eyes.

05:42:10 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:42:42 Eli Grey says, "Everyone got so quiet... I know you were talking before I snapped out of it. you guys must have been talking bad about me again."

05:42:49 Eli Grey grins.

05:42:52 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

05:43:19 I don't understand that.

05:43:21 Morris says to Eli, "Of course we were."

05:43:24 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

05:43:30 Morris says to Eli, "But only the best bad."

05:43:36 Morris says to Eli, "But not the Best bad."

05:43:47 Eli Grey smirks.

05:44:31 Eli Grey says, "I'm turning into an observation rom squatter like you guys."

05:44:36 Eli Grey laughs.

05:44:52 Morris says to Eli, "Like who exactly? I don't squat. I sit on my rear end."

05:45:14 Sarah Bellamy giggles at Morris Corlew.

05:45:24 Eli says to Morris, "Oh c'mon, you know you've passed out in here just like the rest of us."

05:45:27 Sarah Bellamy says, "I sit on his...lap. which is attached to his rear end."

05:45:31 Morris says to Eli, "And Sarah doesn't squat either. She sits on my lap."

05:45:43 Eli Grey says, "Erm.."

05:45:50 Morris says to Eli, "Not usually. Usually I go to bed if I'm sleepy. In my quarters. Last night was an exception unfortunately."

05:45:54 Eli Grey says, "There's a dirty joke in there somewhere.. just can't quite find it."

05:46:01 Morris Corlew chuckles.

05:46:01 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

05:48:07 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

05:48:14 Morris Corlew says, "Bye hell."

05:48:15 Eli Grey winces.

05:48:17 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

05:48:20 Morris Corlew says, "Woo."

05:48:34 Sarah Bellamy grins.

05:48:35 Eli Grey says, "I don't think I'll ever get used to that thing blowing up in our faces."

05:48:43 Sarah Bellamy says, "Me neither."

05:48:48 Morris Corlew says, "Exactly."

05:48:51 Morris Corlew says, "This is so much nicer."

05:48:54 Sarah Bellamy nods.

05:49:16 Eli Grey says, "Ugh.. that squid though.. makes me jump everytime too. but you're right, this is much better."

05:49:59 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

05:50:11 Morris Corlew says, "That squid's pretty cool. Squid in general are interestin creatures."

05:50:26 Sarah Bellamy says, "Just not squid air freshener."

05:50:28 Eli Grey laughs.

05:51:09 Morris Corlew laughs.

05:51:12 Eli Grey says, "It's really only the part where one peeps in, I don't mind it that much otherwise."

05:51:21 Morris Corlew says, "Yes, I...made the mistake of...sprayin that in my capsule."

05:51:27 Morris Corlew says, "Had to go four hours smellin squid."

05:51:28 Sarah Bellamy says, "Eeew."

05:51:32 Morris Corlew says, "Mmhmm."

05:51:35 Vernos Bailey laughs.

05:51:45 Eli Grey asks, "Was it better than the fart, at least?"

05:51:50 Morris Corlew says, "No."

05:51:55 Morris Corlew says, "Much much worse."

05:52:02 Eli Grey chuckles.

05:52:14 Eli Grey says, "Sorry bud, that sounds terrible."

05:52:26 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

05:52:49 Morris Corlew says, "It was."

05:53:19 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

05:53:36 Eli Grey absently sniffs at the air.

05:54:01 Morris Corlew chuckles.

05:54:03 Morris Corlew absently sniffs at the air.

05:54:06 Morris Corlew removes a can of rain-scented air freshener from a forest green backpack.

05:54:07 Morris Corlew sprays a bit of a can of rain-scented air freshener into the air, and the scent of a warm summer rain permeates the area.

05:54:08 Morris Corlew absently sniffs at the air.

05:54:10 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

05:54:12 Morris Corlew puts a can of rain-scented air freshener in a forest green backpack.

05:55:26 Sarah Bellamy absently sniffs at the air.

05:55:30 Sarah Bellamy nods.

05:56:54 Eli Grey roams east.

05:57:19 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

05:57:22 Sarah Bellamy stirs a cold cherry cola float a bit and then digs around for a spoonful of ice cream and eats it.

05:57:33 Sarah Bellamy says, "Forgot I got this."

05:57:55 Morris Corlew grins.

05:57:57 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a small cup of steaming cactus-flavored hot chocolate.

05:59:20 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

06:00:46 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

06:00:46 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:00:48 Morris Corlew says, "Less than a light-year-."

06:00:49 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah that."

06:00:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Fuck."

06:00:55 Morris Corlew chuckles.

06:00:56 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

06:01:00 Morris Corlew says, "And a gust."

06:01:01 Eli Grey roams in from the east.

06:01:07 Eli Grey roams south.

06:01:07 Morris Corlew says, "Wheeeee."

06:01:16 You stretch.

06:01:19 You yawn.

06:01:20 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

06:01:45 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Manx the little calico CatBot, and Ninja the little black CatBot here.

(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

06:01:56 Aisling the Fox says, "Hm."

06:02:22 Shule stifles another yaw, "Night all."

06:02:40 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

06:03:11 Morris says to you, "Night."

06:03:14 Aisling the Fox waves.

06:03:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Night Shule."

06:03:42 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

06:03:45 You wave.

06:03:47 You pull Lily Kaise to her feet.

06:03:51 The door is closed.

06:03:52 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Mid A]

06:03:53 Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

06:04:13 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

06:04:13 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus here.

06:04:18 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

06:04:26 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

06:04:26 Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds.

06:05:12 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

06:05:12 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:05:22 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

06:06:05 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

06:06:21 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:06:27 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:06:37 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:06:39 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

06:06:47 You say to Lily, "Night my love."

06:06:49 Lily says to you, "Nite I love you. Sweet dreams and rest well."

06:07:20 You say to Lily, "I love you too. Rest well and sweet dreams as well."

06:07:21 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

06:07:22 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:07:32 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

06:07:44 A bugle sounds the order to attack and the battle escalates dramatically. Both sides launch all-out assaults into the field.

06:07:44 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:07:47 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

06:09:35 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

06:09:35 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:09:45 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

06:09:59 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tail.

06:11:59 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly east.

06:12:15 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

06:12:15 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:12:25 Listen. You need to be careful.

06:15:24 Remember what I said.

06:15:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:15:34 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

06:22:32 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

06:22:32 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:22:42 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

06:27:00 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

06:27:00 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:27:10 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

06:31:03 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

06:31:03 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:31:14 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

06:38:44 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

06:38:44 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:38:54 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

06:42:24 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

06:42:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:42:34 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

06:44:55 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

06:44:55 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:45:05 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

06:47:25 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

06:47:25 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:47:35 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

06:49:36 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

06:49:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:49:46 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

06:53:44 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

06:53:44 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:53:54 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

06:55:49 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

06:55:49 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:55:59 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

07:01:09 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

07:01:09 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:01:19 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

07:03:26 The curtains close, to no applause.

07:03:26 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:03:36 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

07:08:36 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

07:08:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:08:46 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

07:11:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

07:14:47 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

07:14:47 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:14:57 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

07:15:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki works her fangs.

07:21:43 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:21:53 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

07:23:52 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

07:23:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:24:02 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

07:26:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with her back feet, then eats it.

07:26:20 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

07:26:20 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:26:30 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

07:27:30 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

07:29:37 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

07:29:37 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:29:47 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

07:31:46 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

07:31:46 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:41:46 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:41:56 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

07:42:51 The thunder abates and sunlight once again beams through the viewports. The ants resume their orderly, single-file journey.

07:42:51 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

07:42:54 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

07:47:36 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

07:47:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:47:46 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

07:54:31 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

07:54:31 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

07:54:41 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

07:55:02 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repair time."

07:55:17 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:55:51 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else comin?"

08:00:57 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm gonna check our position real quick, make sure that storm didn't do anything funky if nobody minds."

08:01:11 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably best for most accurate report."

08:01:25 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep. Only take a couple minutes."

08:06:50 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "110.37 LTC down and slightly eastsoutheast from Farport."

08:06:54 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:07:04 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:07:04 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:07:14 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

08:09:12 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

08:09:55 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

08:09:56 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:10:06 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

08:13:04 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Goodnight Morris."

08:13:20 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night."

08:14:22 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

08:14:22 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:14:32 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash.

08:18:31 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:18:41 Listen. You need to be careful.

08:22:07 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Good night Eli."

08:23:08 Here we go. Hang on to something.

08:23:08 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

08:23:09 Ah, back to normal.

08:23:11 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

08:23:12 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

08:24:08 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

08:28:24 Remember what I said.

08:28:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:28:35 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

08:36:02 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

08:36:02 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:36:12 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

08:40:15 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

08:42:12 The curtains close, to no applause.

08:42:12 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:42:22 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

08:55:16 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

09:09:21 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

09:18:51 Lily Kaise lies back in a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

09:19:40 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

09:22:40 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

09:33:18 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

09:35:20 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

09:45:48 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

09:46:13 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

09:46:23 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

09:47:24 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

09:58:56 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

10:09:55 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

10:20:14 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

10:21:13 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

10:31:11 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

10:40:39 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

10:47:29 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

10:47:39 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:49:39 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

10:58:09 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

11:06:09 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

11:32:39 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

11:32:40 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

11:33:38 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else coming outside?"

11:33:48 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Comin'"

11:48:23 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

11:48:33 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

11:48:37 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

11:48:43 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

11:49:51 The quaking stops and the gashes in the ground close up. The platform's violent shaking eases.

11:49:51 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

11:49:54 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

11:53:01 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

11:54:24 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

11:54:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

11:54:34 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

11:54:53 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

11:59:15 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

11:59:15 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

11:59:25 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

11:59:38 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

12:02:31 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

12:02:31 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:02:41 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

12:04:05 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

12:06:25 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

12:06:25 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:06:35 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

12:08:14 The room grows a bit warmer.

12:09:55 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

12:09:56 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:10:05 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

12:12:07 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

12:13:42 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

12:13:42 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:13:52 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

12:15:46 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

12:20:10 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

12:20:10 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:20:20 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

12:22:44 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

12:22:44 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:22:54 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

12:25:27 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

12:25:27 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:25:37 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

12:25:50 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

12:28:34 The curtains close, to no applause.

12:28:34 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:28:44 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

12:30:02 There appear to be about 9 pilots recently active.

12:30:02 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:
%Damien Goss  (L)
%Nissi Valdaire  (L) [a]
%Nicolette Lawrence  (L)
%Caleb Davenport  (L)
%Ali Candan  (L)
%Rogue Romano  (F)
%Nathaniel Owens  (F)
%Hakeem Oiadip  (F)
%Anfisa of Marzore  (M) [v]

* == Out of communications range

% == Detected via Quantum Entanglement comm
Additionally, there are 16 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 25 pilots.

12:31:57 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

12:31:57 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:32:07 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

12:36:30 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

12:36:30 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:36:40 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

12:39:52 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

12:39:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:40:02 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

12:42:10 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

12:42:10 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:42:20 Listen. You need to be careful.

12:45:25 Remember what I said.

12:45:25 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

12:45:35 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

12:46:01 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:50:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

12:53:24 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

12:53:34 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:53:34 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:53:38 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

12:53:44 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

12:54:31 The rain stops as suddenly as it began.

12:54:34 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

12:54:35 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

12:55:53 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

12:55:56 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

12:55:56 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

12:56:06 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

12:59:47 The curtains close, to no applause.

13:00:11 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

13:01:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:04:02 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

13:04:02 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:04:12 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

13:07:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly east.

13:07:18 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

13:07:19 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:07:28 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

13:08:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

13:09:31 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

13:09:32 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:09:42 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

13:15:37 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

13:15:37 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:15:47 Listen. You need to be careful.

13:16:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:18:01 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

13:20:19 Remember what I said.

13:20:19 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:20:29 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

13:21:13 Lily Kaise picks up a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

13:21:19 Lily Kaise puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

13:22:40 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

13:22:40 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:22:50 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

13:26:05 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:26:15 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

13:27:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:29:11 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

13:29:11 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:33:35 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

13:35:47 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

13:35:47 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:35:57 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

13:37:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:44:42 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

13:44:42 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:44:52 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

13:47:04 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

13:47:04 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:47:14 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

13:48:49 You hear voices crying in panic. "Oh no, the brakes!" The train picks up speed rapidly.

13:48:49 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

13:48:50 With a sudden screech, the train manages to apply its brakes.

13:48:52 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

13:48:53 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

13:49:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:49:49 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

13:50:24 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

13:50:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

13:58:02 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

13:58:21 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Again?"

13:58:25 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I got distance."

13:58:41 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:53:35 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

14:58:30 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

14:58:58 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:58:59 You're already standing.

14:59:04 You kiss Lily Kaise.

14:59:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

14:59:14 You pull a blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs off.

14:59:22 You open a small suitcase for a moment.

14:59:23 You remove a small suitcase from a leather briefcase for a moment.

You can go north, east, south, and west.

14:59:46 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

14:59:50 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Mid A]

14:59:50 You see a black plastic tray of spider chow and a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki here.

14:59:53 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

14:59:57 You peer north...

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a large white and strawberry red
14:59:57  paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Emily Ford is sleeping on a white leather sofa.
Aisling the Fox is dozing on a round saffron orange zafu. Anfisa of Marzore and Nissi Valdaire are dozing on a white leather sofa. Damien Goss is seated. Luja Garland is sitting comfortably cross-legged on a floor pillow. Rogue Romano is sitting on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow. Ather Jammoa, Melinda Michaels, and Jason Rat are sitting on a white leather sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.

15:00:09 You wave.

15:00:13 You sit down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

15:00:21 Rogue Romano nods to you.

15:00:43 Luja says to you, "Hi, Shule."

15:01:52 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

15:01:54 You say to Luja, "Hi."

15:02:02 I don't see that here.

15:02:22 You smile at Rogue Romano.

15:02:31 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

15:02:42 Luja says to you, "Slept good?"

15:03:00 You nod and smile at Luja Garland. "I did. Thanks."

15:03:53 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:05:33 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

15:09:57 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:11:33 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

15:16:50 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:17:20 Luja stretches and yawns loudly!

15:17:24 Luja Garland says, "Time to take a nap."

15:17:26 Luja Garland stands up.

15:17:28 Luja Garland waves.

15:17:30 Luja Garland steps south.

15:19:33 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

15:22:25 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

15:24:39 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:30:05 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

15:30:06 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

15:30:06 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

15:30:31 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

15:30:49 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

15:31:08 Melinda Michaels says, "30% charge."

15:31:12 Melinda Michaels says, "Still good."

15:31:19 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

15:33:45 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

15:33:48 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:33:52 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

15:39:33 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

15:44:09 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

15:45:10 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:45:27 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters into the room.

15:45:31 Magellan the arachnoid security robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks.

15:45:34 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters south.

15:45:59 There appear to be about 16 pilots recently active.

15:49:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

15:49:52 I see no "lily" here.

15:51:23 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

15:51:33 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

15:51:34 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

15:53:33 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

15:55:34 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

15:58:34 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

15:58:35 Lily Kaise glides east.

15:59:33 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

15:59:38 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

15:59:40 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

15:59:41 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:00:23 Lily Kaise kisses you.

16:00:33 Lily Kaise puts a cup of hot cafe mocha on a maple coffee table.

16:01:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:01:53 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:02:00 You say to Lily, "Hey love."

16:02:01 Lily says to you, "Good day Love."

16:02:08 You smile at Lily Kaise.

16:02:16 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

16:11:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:13:03 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:13:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

16:19:33 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

16:19:52 Lily Kaise takes a bite of an orange scone.

16:19:56 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

16:19:58 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:20:03 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

16:20:07 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

16:22:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:23:34 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

16:25:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

16:30:11 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

16:30:34 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

16:31:02 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

16:31:10 Lily Kaise finishes off a cup of hot cafe mocha.

16:31:18 Lily Kaise gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

16:33:33 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

16:34:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:35:34 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

16:35:43 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

16:35:48 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

16:35:48 A riftstorm appears to be 1.01 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Up and Slightly Southeast.
An astable riftstorm appears to be 2.95 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northnortheast.

16:36:03 Melinda Michaels says, "Damn storms."

16:37:34 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

16:37:35 Rogue Romano says, "We been seein' a lot of storms this trip."

16:37:44 You nod.

16:37:49 Melinda Michaels says, "At least that one isn't energetic."

16:37:59 Rogue Romano asks, "What is that one anyway?"

16:38:27 Melinda Michaels says, "I think it changes flow a bit. Ic ould be wrong."

16:38:42 Rogue Romano says, "Oh okay."

16:38:52 Rogue Romano removes a small sparkly black portfolio from a purple and yellow tie-dyed canvas backpack.

16:40:29 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

16:40:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

16:40:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allos."

16:40:58 Rogue Romano says, "Oh, don have astable in my notes."

16:41:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Many breaks, seems we are in stormy area of the space."

16:41:06 Rogue Romano waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

16:41:08 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa.

16:41:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec waves to Rogue Romano.

16:41:20 Rogue Romano asks, "How is Bob this afternoon?"

16:41:27 Rogue Romano closes a small sparkly black portfolio.

16:41:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah it seems a bit stormy out here."

16:41:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "All is good, all is well."

16:41:33 Rogue Romano puts a small sparkly black portfolio in a purple and yellow tie-dyed canvas backpack.

16:41:36 Rogue Romano grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

16:41:43 Melinda Michaels says, "I need to find my notes. I had all the types noted."

16:42:13 Rogue Romano says, "I only got three down in mine. The strange, energetic and churning."

16:42:35 Melinda Michaels asks, "Churning is the one that takes over your rift headings or is that chaotic?"

16:42:38 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

16:42:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Don't remember anything too amazing about the astable."

16:42:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Chruning."

16:42:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:42:53 Melinda Michaels nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

16:43:00 Lily Kaise says, "There's Astable."

16:43:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Chaotic just spins around a lot."

16:43:04 Melinda Michaels asks, "Chaotic changes flow a lot, right?"

16:43:10 Melinda Michaels nods.

16:43:22 Rogue Romano says, "Churning; Becomes pushy. You can lose total control of ships control, best to just ride along with the flow. Also, can cause damage to drive."

16:43:25 Melinda Michaels says, "I am going to put these in my book if ever I finish writing it."

16:43:39 Melinda Michaels nods to Rogue Romano.

16:44:07 Melinda Michaels says, "I remember the first time it happened to Akemi and I. We were like why did you change the heading, I didn't do it."

16:44:09 Melinda Michaels laughs.

16:44:16 Rogue Romano grins.

16:44:41 Lily Kaise says, "Obviously Energetic is just that it blasts and blasts and tends to kill the drive."

16:44:49 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

16:44:58 Rogue Romano nods.

16:45:03 Melinda Michaels says, "Usually give nice speed if you can handle continuous repairs."

16:45:07 Lily Kaise nods.

16:45:15 You nod.

16:45:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "One cycle energetic storm will do permanent damage to drive and all will be lost."

16:45:41 Lily Kaise says, "Then the teleporting one is one I'm not totally familiar with and I am not looking forward to encountering."

16:45:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:46:05 Lily Kaise asks, "I guess that is the Strange one?"

16:46:15 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, I've seen them in action."

16:46:24 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

16:46:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I don't recall actually being teleportetred from a natural strange storm."

16:46:32 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

16:46:32 Rogue Romano says, "I'm not sure. I have not experienced teleportin' one yet I don think."

16:46:42 Melinda Michaels glances at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec. "We got teleported like 20 LTC on my recent trip."

16:46:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "It was a natural one?"

16:46:51 Rogue Romano says, "Of course, last trip was with Keegan."

16:46:56 Lily Kaise says, "Ok yeah, so wasn't certain. I have seen them on the display but was able to avoid them."

16:46:58 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

16:47:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Oh, okay."

16:51:08 Small, bioluminescent alien insects flit above the grass, flashing bright purple hues.

16:53:19 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

16:53:30 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

16:55:57 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

16:56:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:56:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We shall ride storm all the way to the IFEESS."

17:01:34 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:01:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly west.

17:08:48 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

17:08:51 Morris Corlew waves.

17:08:53 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:09:40 Morris Corlew says, "Sheesh. Finally get away from one storm and we've got more."

17:09:52 Rogue Romano nods.

17:10:00 Rogue Romano examines a small hot chocolate dispenser robot for a moment.

17:10:03 Rogue Romano presses a shiny red button on a small hot chocolate dispenser robot and helps herself to a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

17:10:10 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

17:10:24 Morris Corlew snaps his fingers.

17:10:27 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:10:27 Morris Corlew lopes east.

17:11:00 Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

17:11:02 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:11:10 You wave to Morris Corlew.

17:11:14 Morris Corlew waves to you.

17:11:26 Morris Corlew carefully unwraps a roast beef sandwich.

17:11:26 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

17:11:26 A riftstorm appears to be 1.53 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Up and Slightly Southeast.
An astable riftstorm appears to be 1.93 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northnortheast.

17:13:35 Melinda says to Morris, "Hey."

17:13:46 Morris says to Melinda, "Howdy."

17:16:11 Morris Corlew picks up half of a roast beef sandwich and takes a huge bite.

17:18:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

17:19:09 Morris says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Howdy there."

17:19:34 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

17:23:20 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

17:23:37 Morris Corlew takes another large bite of a roast beef sandwich.

17:23:47 Damien Goss stands up.

17:23:48 Damien Goss steps south.

17:25:34 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

17:25:45 Morris Corlew finishes off half of a roast beef sandwich.

17:27:34 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:27:55 Morris Corlew starts in on the second half of a roast beef sandwich.

17:28:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:29:09 Morris says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Wut."

17:31:34 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

17:33:05 Morris Corlew takes another large bite of a roast beef sandwich.

17:33:07 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:33:29 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

17:34:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

17:35:54 Morris Corlew finishes off the last of a roast beef sandwich.

17:36:15 Morris Corlew crumples up his stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

17:40:54 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

17:41:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

17:43:39 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

17:47:42 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

17:48:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The trail of storm will lead us to the promised space of storms."

17:48:32 Morris Corlew grins.

17:48:44 You grin.

17:49:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

17:51:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

17:51:34 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:54:15 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

17:55:21 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

17:55:31 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

17:58:56 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

18:06:35 Vernos Bailey asks, "What is that?"

18:06:49 Morris Corlew says, "They're like chaotic but tend to shift more."

18:07:02 Morris Corlew says, "Chaotic's gusty."

18:07:05 Vernos Bailey asks, "Shift more?"

18:07:15 Morris Corlew nods. "The flow."

18:07:32 Vernos Bailey says, "So we are going to get pushed around a lot."

18:07:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

18:07:56 Morris Corlew nods.

18:08:08 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:08:26 Morris Corlew says, "Not as bad as with a churning though. They force your heading. No fun if you're trying to get somewhere specific."

20:04:23 Luja Garland asks, "Or is it the same one following us?"

20:04:33 Jason Rat says, "A lot out this way."

20:04:39 Morris Corlew says, "Nah."

20:04:42 Morris Corlew says, "This is a new one."

20:05:32 Morris Corlew asks, "That energetic?"

20:05:36 Jason Rat says, "Speed was just shit and we couldn't get away from it."

20:05:46 Morris Corlew says, "It was moving faster than we were..."

20:06:11 Jason Rat says, "We were only going 900. We were getting away, but not much."

20:06:20 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

20:06:21 Luja Garland says, "That's a fast moving storm."

20:06:29 Morris Corlew says, "Not really."

20:06:44 Morris Corlew says, "Can't outrun much goin 900."

20:07:03 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

20:07:27 Jason Rat says, "Woo dinner."

20:07:33 Morris Corlew says, "Yick."

20:07:51 Jason Rat cheers for a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins!

Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a red shipsuit with silver trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsi

She is carrying nothing.

20:11:56 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

20:11:57 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

20:14:15 Melinda says to Luja, "How's it going?"

20:14:33 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

20:15:00 Aisling the Fox stretches.

20:15:45 The wind blows without control; the sky flashes with bursts of radiant lightning.

20:15:46 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

20:16:00 Luja says to Melinda, "Awake and good! And you?"

20:16:13 The wind abates slightly as thunder continues to roll across the plains.

20:16:14 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

20:16:16 Melinda says to Luja, "Not bad."

20:16:46 Luja Garland says, "Not bad is also good."

20:17:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "You can do it, Luja."

20:17:21 You grin.

20:17:48 Luja says to Pierre-Louis, "What can I do?"

20:17:56 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:18:03 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

20:18:40 Morris Corlew nudges a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins gently.

20:18:45 Morris Corlew grins at a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins.

20:19:05 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

20:20:08 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Anything you believe in."

20:20:56 Luja gives Pierre-Louis the thousand yard stare and sits up straight. "Yes. Yes, I can!"

20:21:04 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:23:05 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

20:23:18 The wind blows without control; the sky flashes with bursts of radiant lightning.

20:23:19 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

20:23:45 The wind abates slightly as thunder continues to roll across the plains.

20:23:46 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

20:23:59 Eli Grey roams in from the south.

20:24:04 Eli Grey waves.

20:24:06 You wave to Eli Grey.

20:24:13 Luja says to Eli, "Hi, Eli."

20:24:22 Morris says to Eli, "Yo."

20:24:30 Eli Grey says, "How's everybody doing? This storm is nuts."

20:24:41 You say, "Doing alright."

20:24:46 Morris Corlew says, "Fine, fine."

20:24:58 Luja says to Eli, "Very good."

20:25:01 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:25:36 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:27:23 Melinda Michaels slumps in a white leather sofa and goes to sleep.

20:30:05 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly west.

20:30:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, it is blowing in good direction, the storm."

20:30:57 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

20:31:00 Luja Garland says, "We are very fast."

20:31:02 Morris Corlew says, "Has been the whole time."

20:31:20 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Makes me wonder if we missed any cool things in all these storms."

20:31:48 Vernos Bailey says, "One may never know."

20:31:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Alas."

20:32:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The edge of our muddled sensors will never been known."

20:32:29 Luja Garland says, "We are too fast."

20:32:32 Luja Garland finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:32:33 The storm moves off into the distance, and the wind dies down.

20:32:33 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

20:32:36 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

20:32:40 Jason Rat says, "You can never be to fast."

20:32:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "On to the next storm."

20:32:57 Vernos Bailey says, "Yup."

20:33:10 Luja Garland says, "There are situations where you can be too fast."

20:33:25 Vernos Bailey says, "Sex..."

20:33:32 Vernos Bailey smirks.

20:33:58 Luja Garland blinks.

20:34:05 A black digital felo game beeps insistently for food.

20:34:05 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

20:34:12 Luja Garland says, "I was thinking going very high beacons before my ship is upgraded."

20:34:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Speaking without thinking."

20:34:24 Vernos Bailey snickers.

20:34:34 Luja Garland says, "Hah."

20:34:43 Vernos Bailey says, "And yes, very high beacons without an upgraded shi[."

20:34:49 Vernos Bailey says, "Ship I mean."

20:35:35 A black digital felo game beeps insistently for food.

20:35:42 Morris says to Vernos, "Uh...talking of the rift..."

20:35:47 Morris Corlew says, "Not..."

20:35:51 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Never mind."

20:36:14 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh I was just naming off instances in which one could be too fast."

20:36:15 Luja says to Morris, "Was that also innuendo? If so I don't get it."

20:36:29 Morris says to Luja, "Nah."

20:36:35 Morris says to Luja, "I don't generally do inuendo."

20:36:36 Morris Corlew shrugs.

20:37:05 A black digital felo game beeps insistently for food.

20:37:11 Luja Garland nods.

20:37:16 Vernos Bailey says, "Hey everything I say can not score."

20:37:44 Eli Grey says, "Nobody wins when your zero-point energy receptical goes off prematurely."

20:37:51 Vernos Bailey laughs.

20:37:59 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

20:38:01 Eli Grey snickers.

20:38:03 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

20:38:07 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

20:38:08 An astable riftstorm appears to be 3.27 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Northwest and Up.

20:38:08 Eli Grey says, "Ok, that one was a bit ofa reach."

20:38:10 Morris Corlew says, "A thing 'oh wait."

20:38:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Was a good try, Eli."

20:38:28 Morris Corlew says, "Bye bye Blowy McBlowface."

20:38:35 A black digital felo game beeps insistently for food.

20:38:35 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

20:38:37 Eli Grey says, "Astable? Not used to that term."

20:38:46 Luja Garland asks, "The flow is all over our backs?"

20:38:53 Eli Grey asks, "I guess.. that means it fluxuates between unstable and stable perhaps?"

20:38:55 Luja Garland says, "No, not any more."

20:39:05 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

20:39:07 Morris Corlew removes a small black leather portfolio from a metallic silver messenger bag.

20:39:12 Morris Corlew removes a sheet of green paper from a small black leather portfolio.

20:39:19 Morris Corlew puts down a sheet of green paper.

20:39:22 Morris Corlew taps a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser and nods to Eli Grey.

20:39:25 Morris Corlew coughs.

20:39:27 --

20:39:27 Astable         Similar to chaotic storms but are prone to shifting
Chaotic         Gusty. You will find you are sometimes going faster than the local flow inside the storm
Churning             Force your heading and control your sails. Will spin around so that you tend to exit and 
               then reenter them.
Energetic            Zap you. A little disorienting, as the "scene" changes every time energy is discharged 
               into the ship. Particularly bad for the drive.
Hazy                 Seem to have jagged edges. It's possible to ride the edge of these and go in and out of 
               them. Tend to be slightly slower local flow than some storm types.
Phasing         Move you deeper or shallower in the rift.
Strange         Can telelport. Otherwise similar to an energetic storm.

Artificial Energetic storms are most often formed when there are other storms in the area
Artificial storms generally last a little over an hour (or about 5.5 subcycles)

Permanent Calm: Spinward Clan Space
Permanent Storms: Breath of Gunarsh. There is a planetary system in the "eye" of this storm.

20:39:32 Morris Corlew taps a sheet of green paper and nods to Eli Grey.

20:39:36 Vernos says to Morris, "Hey I tried to be funny. It just did not work."

20:39:48 Eli Grey says, "Interesting, I learned a new word."

20:40:01 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.

20:40:05 A black digital felo game beeps insistently for food.

20:40:05 Morris says to Eli, "What's that?"

20:40:12 Eli Grey says, "Astable."

20:40:41 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

20:40:57 Jason Rat stands up from a white leather sofa.

20:40:57 Morris Corlew says, "Reminds me of the joke about what it meant. Means it's really flat, ya know, as a table. Astable."

20:41:00 Jason Rat pulls Aisling the Fox to her feet.

20:41:02 Jason Rat holds Aisling the Fox's hand, taking her into his group.

20:41:03 Jason Rat's group jogs west.

20:41:03 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

20:41:04 Jason Rat jogs in from the west followed by Aisling the Fox.

20:41:04 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.
Eli Grey laughs.

20:41:05 Jason Rat's group jogs south.
Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

20:41:18 Jason Rat jogs in from the south.

20:41:19 Jason Rat sits down on a white leather sofa.

20:41:23 Jason Rat says, "Beep beep."

20:41:35 Eli Grey says, "At first I thought it was some sort of error, but that seemed highly unlikely."

20:42:09 Morris Corlew shakes his head.

20:43:19 A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it passes.

20:45:54 Eli Grey roams south.

20:46:08 Eli Grey roams in from the south.

20:46:15 Eli Grey says, "Wow, still a nice chunk of charge left."

20:46:19 Morris Corlew nods.

20:46:22 Morris says to Eli, "What was it?"

20:46:33 Eli Grey says, "26%."

20:46:35 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

20:47:05 A Tardick lizard named Freyja's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

20:47:22 Eli Grey says, "I mean it's not a ton or anything, but considering how far we've gotten on what we had, pretty good."

20:47:54 Eli Grey says, "I knew that battery was gonna be awesome when I saw it on the status display."

20:48:01 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

20:48:08 Morris Corlew grins.

20:48:36 Eli Grey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

20:48:38 Luja Garland asks, "We haven't recharged once yet?"

20:48:44 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:48:51 Eli says to Luja, "Nope!"

20:48:53 Jason Rat says, "Nope."

20:48:56 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:48:58 Luja Garland says, "Holy cow."

20:49:02 Eli says to Luja, "Isn't it beautiful?"

20:49:06 Morris Corlew says, "I'd imagine tonight or early in the morning."

20:49:11 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

20:49:16 Luja nods vigorously to Eli.

20:49:34 Eli Grey says, "We gotta be getting pretty close to a thousand lightyears too."

20:49:43 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

20:50:07 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

20:50:37 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

20:51:33 Eli Grey says, "We gotta be getting pretty close to a thousand lightyears too."

20:51:41 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Ugh."

20:53:19 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

20:53:19 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

20:53:23 Aisling the Fox glances around at her surroundings.

20:53:33 Aisling the Fox sits down on a white leather sofa.

20:53:43 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

20:54:02 Aisling the Fox says, "Beep."

20:54:11 Morris beeps at Aisling.

20:54:23 Aisling the Fox grins.

20:54:25 Aisling the Fox kisses Jason Rat.

20:55:37 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:57:37 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

20:57:37 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:01:08 Eli taps with interest at a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks.

21:01:34 Eli Grey says, "Whoops, they didn't seem to like that."

21:01:40 Eli Grey says, "Didn't mean to scare them."

21:01:59 Morris Corlew says, "Aww."

21:02:11 Morris runs his finger along a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks near one of the Maxwells.

21:03:07 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly east.

21:03:31 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

21:03:41 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

21:04:42 Morris Corlew says, "Ehh."

21:07:41 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

21:10:54 Eli says to the staring crowd, "We're really not all that entertaining at the moment, try again later"

21:11:24 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:11:36 Morris Corlew grins at Eli Grey.

21:11:37 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!
Vernos Bailey chuckles.

21:11:40 Morris Corlew says, "Owww."

21:11:44 Morris Corlew says, "Sheesh."

21:11:47 Morris says to Eli, "Gee, thanks."

21:11:49 Eli Grey winces.

21:11:55 Eli Grey says, "Ok,  ok, we'll perform."

21:12:19 Morris Corlew says, "I mean we're not cute lil seals or nothin, but...dangit."

21:12:20 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

21:14:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's a lotta repairs."

21:14:13 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

21:14:20 Morris Corlew says, "That storm was quite the zapper."

21:14:21 Eli Grey says, "No doubt."

21:16:37 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

21:18:24 Anfisa of Marzore warbles a complicated sequence of musical syllables.

21:18:27 Anfisa of Marzore strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

21:18:37 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

21:18:49 Nissi Valdaire strokes a Tardick lizard named Freyja's warm scaly skin.

21:18:49 Morris Corlew says, "Hey there Freyja."

21:18:53 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Freyja's warm scaly skin.

21:22:07 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

21:22:37 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

21:23:55 Morris says to a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, "Nice jump there."

21:24:13 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

21:24:13 Nissi Valdaire walks east.

21:24:24 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the east.

21:24:28 Nissi Valdaire carefully unwraps a turkey sandwich.

21:24:32 Nissi Valdaire dangles a turkey sandwich in front of a Tardick lizard named Freyja. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

21:24:34 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

21:27:11 Morris says to a Tardick lizard named Freyja, "You are what you eat."

21:29:08 Melinda Michaels suddenly awakens.

21:32:38 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

21:33:06 Morris Corlew stretches.

21:33:09 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters east.

21:33:32 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

21:33:38 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly east.

21:37:31 Morris rubs his right ear.

21:39:37 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:43:54 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

21:44:56 Morris Corlew mutters. "Yeah, back atcha."

21:47:38 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:48:39 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

21:49:09 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

21:54:14 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

21:56:09 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.

21:57:38 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:00:43 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

22:03:43 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

22:03:51 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

22:03:59 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:04:31 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

22:04:50 The curtains close, to no applause.

22:04:57 Eli says to the audience, "comon, we weren't that bad"

22:05:01 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

22:05:04 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:05:12 Eli Grey exclaims, "Woo hoo!"

22:05:15 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:05:17 Morris Corlew says, "Apparently we were. We always seem to be. 'Cept for when they -."

22:05:18 Morris Corlew sighs.

22:05:22 Morris Corlew says, "Damned ants."

22:05:22 Luja Garland says, "Morris' favorite."

22:05:35 Morris Corlew says, "Not."

22:05:50 Eli says to Morris, "Except for when they what? I don't think I've ever seen them look satisfied with anything."

22:06:01 Morris Corlew says, "Uh...no, they turn on each other."

22:06:09 Morris glances around distractedly.

22:06:11 Eli Grey blinks.

22:06:24 Eli Grey says, "I'm not sure I've ever witnessed that. Sounds pretty horrific."

22:06:39 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet. "They throw bottles and rotten fruit and stuff too."

22:07:26 Ather Jammoa suddenly awakens.

22:07:33 Luja Garland says, "Hi, Ather."

22:07:38 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:07:43 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

22:07:44 Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner and glances wildly about in a paranoid manner and nods.

22:07:56 Morris says to Ather, "Ants..."

22:08:00 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Woo!"

22:08:04 Morris Corlew sighs.

22:08:12 Ather says to Morris, "Sorry, you're the only one!"

22:08:14 Ather Jammoa pats Morris Corlew on the back.

22:08:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Actually, I find ants to be one of the most interesting creatures."

22:08:44 Ather Jammoa says, "They can lift like four times their weight, they have an intreaguing cast system even and all of them do their work without any seeming conflict."

22:08:46 Morris says to Ather, "Until you get stung up head to toe by fire ants ya accidentally fell asleep on."

22:08:56 Morris says to Ather, "A billion trillion times their weight."

22:08:57 Morris Corlew smirks.

22:09:05 Morris Corlew says, "They're creepy."

22:09:06 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, this ship doesn't count."

22:09:25 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I think humans can learn a lot from ants!"

22:09:45 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

22:10:15 Ather Jammoa says, "I nominate Morris to spend an extended amount of time studying a gigantic fireant colony."

22:10:19 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

22:10:20 Morris says to Ather, "No."

22:10:33 Ather Jammoa says, "Pierre just seconded the nomination by his silence."

22:10:40 You say, "I second it."

22:10:43 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly east.

22:10:44 You ask, "Erm, third it?"

22:10:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Anfisa just thirded it by standing there nad looking marginally intimidating."

22:10:56 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, I guess she fourthed it."

22:10:59 Ather Jammoa says, "Shule thirded it."

22:11:06 Morris Corlew sighs.

22:11:09 Ather Jammoa pats Morris Corlew on the back.

22:11:09 Morris Corlew says, "No."

22:11:29 Ather says to Morris, "No worries, pal. We'll bring you food fit for human consumption. Then, you can drop the crums, and watch the ants slowly and steadilyc arry them off to the colony."

22:11:42 Morris Corlew sighs at Ather Jammoa.

22:14:36 There appear to be about 27 pilots recently active.

22:14:36 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:
*Ather Jammoa  (A) [am]

22:17:38 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

22:19:13 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

22:21:43 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

22:22:18 Ather Jammoa asks, "No one has any spider chow?"

22:22:38 Luja Garland says, "I can't afford it."

22:22:53 Morris Corlew says, "There's some in the corridor."

22:22:55 Ather Jammoa says, "How can you not afford it!? It's cheap."

22:23:00 Morris Corlew says, "Outside my quarters."

22:23:08 Morris says to a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, "Nasty spider."

22:23:08 Ather Jammoa nods.

22:23:16 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:23:17 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:23:18 Morris Corlew picks up a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins.

22:23:19 Morris Corlew lopes south.

22:23:20 Ather Jammoa says, "That one at least looks hungry."

22:23:27 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

22:23:28 Morris Corlew says, "There."

22:23:35 Morris Corlew says, "Can lead him to food, but who knows if he'll eat."

22:23:36 Morris Corlew shrugs.

22:23:38 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:25:41 Luja Garland stands up.

22:25:45 Luja Garland says, "Disappearing for a bit."

22:25:49 Luja Garland waves.

22:25:51 Luja Garland steps south.

22:26:15 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

22:26:18 Luja Garland gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:26:22 Luja Garland examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

22:26:23 Luja Garland helps herself to a cup of hot red rooibos tea.

22:26:23 Morris says to Luja Garland, "That was a short disappearance."

22:26:24 Luja Garland steps west.

22:26:26 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

22:27:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "There are a few trays of spidey chow around. I'm sure Higgins won't starve!"

22:27:31 Morris says to Lily, "I took him back to the one by our quarters."

22:27:45 Morris says to Lily, "Ather doesn't like looking at hungry things."

22:27:47 Lily Kaise says, "Ok well I have like three down."

22:27:50 Morris Corlew grins.

22:28:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah he just got hungry before he found the chow."

22:28:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:28:09 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "I knew where that one was, as I've stubbed my toe one it and knocked it across the corridor a few times."

22:28:23 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Watch your feet!"

22:28:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:28:48 Morris says to Lily, "It's cramped in there."

22:28:57 Ather Jammoa says, "When I see hungry things I tend to want to eat them."

22:28:59 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:29:03 Morris says to Lily, "Three aquariums and a thing of chow."

22:29:05 Morris Corlew laughs at Ather Jammoa.

22:29:19 Morris says to Lily, "Hardly any room to walk, especially if you're half asleep and goin to the head."

22:29:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well then watch your feet! You will live! Better for it!"

22:29:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:30:22 Morris says to Lily, "I'm not a tiny person. Gotta squeeze to get past the aquariums."

22:30:24 Lily Kaise says, "Those trays really are pretty small. Smaller than a bowl of Felo chow even because spiders don't need a big food trough to begin with and they are so small."

22:30:48 Morris says to Lily, "Yes, but with the aquariums, there's just no room in that hall."

22:30:56 Lily Kaise says, "Aww you will live."

22:31:07 Morris says to Lily, "I have so far. I break a tow though..."

22:31:09 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely and grins.

22:31:12 Lily Kaise says, "If there wasn't room for them, I daresay they wouldn't fit."

22:31:20 Morris says to Lily, "They fit. I barely fit."

22:31:30 Lily Kaise asks, "But gives you something to be unhappy about right?"

22:31:38 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

22:31:40 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

22:31:41 Morris says to Lily, "I'm not unhappy."

22:31:48 Morris says to Lily, "Just tellin ya it's crowded back there."

22:31:56 Lily Kaise says, "So are most shps."

22:32:07 Morris says to Lily, "Most ships are croweded before three aquariums in one hall."

22:32:08 Morris Corlew grins at Lily Kaise.

22:32:17 Lily Kaise says, "Well such is the way it is."

22:32:37 Melinda Michaels says, "He's right, it is crowded."

22:32:41 Melinda Michaels says, "That's all."

22:32:51 Lily Kaise says, "Well tell the ship builders to not allow things."

22:32:55 Morris says to Melinda, "She thinks I'm weird I've stubbed my toe back there."

22:32:56 Morris Corlew shrugs.

22:33:04 Morris Corlew says, "Wait."

22:33:08 Morris Corlew asks, "Tell them to...not allow things?"

22:33:12 Melinda Michaels laughs.

22:33:12 Eli Grey says, "They're not spiders, they're ArachnoPals."

22:33:16 Eli Grey smirks.

22:33:16 Morris Corlew asks, "Like...what?"

22:33:17 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

22:33:26 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

22:33:31 Morris Corlew says, "They're going to post rules about what we can and can't bring -."

22:33:32 Morris Corlew says, "Oh well."

22:33:33 Morris Corlew sighs.

22:33:55 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

22:34:00 Morris Corlew shakes his head.

22:34:28 Eli Grey says, "They better keep their hands off my chips."

22:34:31 Eli Grey chuckles.

22:34:36 Morris says to Eli, "Who?"

22:34:38 Eli Grey says, "Although, they take up very little room."

22:34:49 Eli Grey says, "The folks telling us what we can't bring on board."

22:34:52 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

22:34:55 Eli Grey says, "Or rather what we can't have in the ships."

22:35:04 Eli Grey finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:35:07 Eli Grey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:35:25 Eli Grey says, "I'm doing it again aren't I? Jumping into a conversation I know nothing about."

22:35:28 Morris Corlew says, "Oh. Yeah, that was a weird thing to say. It's just crowded in an already crowded hallway. Tough to squeeze by those things."

22:35:36 Morris Corlew shakes his head at Eli Grey. "You're fine."

22:35:43 Eli Grey removes an empty sample container from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

22:35:46 Eli Grey puts an empty sample container in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

22:35:49 Eli Grey removes a metal container from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

22:35:52 Eli Grey puts down a metal container.

22:35:55 Eli Grey removes a small bag of Chippy's Chips from a metal container.

22:36:01 Eli Grey asks, "Anybody?"

22:36:03 Eli Grey points at a metallic silver touch einrophone.

22:36:06 Eli Grey says, "Er."

22:36:10 Eli Grey points at a metal container.

22:36:25 Morris Corlew says, "No thanks."

22:36:32 Morris Corlew asks, "What's the difference between the bags?"

22:36:45 Morris Corlew asks, "Some are Chippy and some are Chippy's? Are they another flavor?"

22:37:05 Eli Grey says, "Nah, they're all just synthbeef with potato flavoring."

22:37:19 Eli Grey says, "They came out with some corn chips made from potatos, but I've never seen those."

22:37:19 Morris Corlew nods.

22:37:36 Eli Grey picks up a metal container.

22:37:42 Eli Grey puts a metal container in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

22:37:45 Eli Grey carefully pulls open the top of a small bag of Chippy's Chips.

22:37:48 Eli Grey grabs a large chip from a small bag of Chippy's Chips and pops it into his mouth, crunching down on it.

22:39:38 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:41:16 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

22:41:17 Damien Goss sits down.

22:41:21 Morris Corlew waves to Damien Goss.

22:41:22 Vernos Bailey waves to Damien Goss.

22:41:27 Damien Goss waves.

22:41:36 Vernos Bailey says, "Just chugging along."

22:41:41 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

22:41:50 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

22:45:23 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

22:46:23 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

22:49:39 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:56:40 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

22:58:52 Eli says to Vernos, "We're marching on and on."

22:59:04 Eli Grey gets a golden chip from a small bag of Chippy's Chips and chomps down on it.

22:59:14 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

22:59:35 Eli throws his arms up and exclaims, "Wheeeeee!"

22:59:42 Eli Grey grabs several small chips from a small bag of Chippy's Chips and eats them one by one, crunching contentedly.

23:01:18 Morris Corlew sighs and mutters. "Damned ants."

23:01:25 Eli Grey pats Morris Corlew on the back.

23:01:31 Eli says to Morris, "At least they're out there bud."

23:01:43 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey. "Indeed."

23:01:51 Morris Corlew says, "These ship walls are way thicker than a sleeping bag."

23:01:55 Morris pales slightly.

23:01:57 Eli Grey grins.

23:01:58 Eli Grey nods.

23:02:28 Eli Grey says, "And they can take torpedos and plasma blasts with ease."

23:02:32 Luja Garland steps in from the west.

23:02:34 Luja Garland gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:02:35 Luja Garland steps south.

23:02:39 Morris Corlew stares at Eli Grey.

23:03:01 Eli Grey says, "Although.. I'd be lieing if I said it didn't make me nervous when the hull starts creaking while we're underwater though."

23:03:09 Morris Corlew nods.

23:03:34 Morris Corlew says, "I never count the ship walls as real protection from things in the rift."

23:03:50 Eli says to Morris, "Then how do you stay sane?"

23:03:56 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

23:04:11 Morris says to Eli, "I dunno. Just go with the flow and hope for the best, I guess."

23:04:13 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

23:04:15 Eli Grey says, "I mean, I have no doubt that you are correct, but yeah..."

23:05:03 Morris says to Eli, "Yeah, I'm perturbed by the ants, but...I dunno. Just somethin about the rift...even with the stuff that's happened to folks, myself included, all-in-all it just don't bother me."

23:05:12 Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

23:05:24 Eli Grey says, "Well, Fienstein did spend years in it I believe, and he's fine."

23:05:29 Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:05:31 Eli Grey says, "Relatively fine."

23:06:00 Morris says to Eli, "Bad stuff happened to me explorin the mountains around my home. The fire ant thing and what caused this scar on my cheek included. But...I still love hikin and explorin out there."

23:06:28 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

23:06:36 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

23:06:40 Luja Garland begins sitting comfortably cross-legged on a floor pillow.

23:06:46 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

23:07:06 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

23:07:20 Eli Grey says, "There we go, is that better? Nothing like the open rift ocean."

23:07:26 Morris Corlew chuckles. "Yep."

23:07:39 Morris Corlew says, "I got pretty seasick first time I was in this one."

23:07:41 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:07:49 Morris Corlew says, "Was...wow, just over a year ago."

23:07:57 Ather hmms.

23:08:06 Ather Jammoa asks, "Aren't we actually technically over the 1000 lightyear mark now?"

23:08:11 Morris says to Ather, "Should be."

23:08:19 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Nissi!"

23:08:20 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Nissi!"

23:08:20 Eli says to Ather, "I would think so."

23:08:21 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Nissi!"

23:08:23 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Ather Jammoa yells, "Nissi!"

23:08:24 Morris says to Ather, "Dangit."

23:08:38 Damien Goss says, "If not then we're pretty close."

23:08:40 Morris says to Ather, "As annoyin as Aisling."

23:08:45 Melinda Michaels says, "My guess is we are."

23:08:50 Ather Jammoa says, "Pretty sure we are."

23:09:00 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:09:15 Morris Corlew says, "We had 16LTC or so to go when I stopped for repairs, so even with drift, we should be."

23:10:05 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

23:10:06 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:10:12 Luja Garland waves to Sarah Bellamy.

23:10:14 Luja Garland says, "Hey, Sarah."

23:10:23 Morris Corlew waves to Sarah Bellamy. "Howdy Sweets."

23:10:24 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, I guess we could jus tkeep going until the next thingy that we spot on the sensors, image/probe that (if applicable) then turn around."

23:10:32 Eli says to Sarah Bellamy, "Wwe were totally not talking about you."

23:10:33 Ather Jammoa says, "Unless Nissi wakes up first."

23:10:36 Morris Corlew asks, "Why would we turn around?"

23:10:41 Sarah Bellamy giggles at Eli Grey.

23:10:42 Morris Corlew says, "We haven't even had to charge once yet."

23:10:44 Melinda says to Ather, "She isn't turning around."

23:10:45 "Hi!" Sarah Bellamy waves to Morris Corlew.

23:10:46 Ather Jammoa asks, "Didn't she say 1000 lightyears?"

23:10:49 Morris Corlew asks, "No?"

23:10:53 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Oh!"

23:10:57 Ather Jammoa says, "I thought she said 1000 lightyears."

23:10:57 Eli Grey says, "No I don't think we're stopping at a thousand."

23:11:04 Damien Goss says, "She said best to 1000 light years, that's where all the interesting stuff is."

23:11:05 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Oh, well, that's good then!"

23:11:14 Sarah Bellamy smiles at Luja Garland. "Hi."

23:11:16 Morris Corlew nods.

23:11:16 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

23:11:19 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, she said past there was where we realy wanted to start checking stuff out."

23:11:22 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

23:11:26 Ather Jammoa says, "I thought she was just doing like, something relaly short. That's why I was like wait what."

23:11:27 Morris Corlew squeezes Sarah Bellamy affectionately.

23:11:31 Damien Goss shakes his head.

23:11:35 Morris Corlew shakes his head at Ather Jammoa.

23:11:39 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:11:46 Eli says to Ather, "Nope, you are stuck now with all of us, it's too late now."

23:11:49 Damien Goss says, "I suspect her goal is to arrive at Farport with 2% charge and 100% ware on the furnace."

23:11:49 Eli cackles madly.

23:11:58 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

23:11:58 Morris Corlew grins.

23:12:02 Morris Corlew says, "That'd be awesome."

23:12:05 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey I was close to that on my last trip."

23:12:06 Ather says to Eli, "Eh, I'm indifferent. I can go somewhere where none of you can get to me!"

23:12:09 Damien Goss nods to Melinda Michaels.

23:12:10 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

23:12:23 Eli Grey asks, "Deep into your own mind?"

23:12:28 Morris Corlew laughs.

23:12:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, not that far."

23:12:28 Eli Grey says, "Wish I could do that."

23:12:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "No more than one percent charge on return."

23:12:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Just the bolt."

23:12:33 Morris says to Eli, "Probably Invocation."

23:12:51 Eli Grey says, "Oh, that's right, I don't know why I keep forgetting that Invocation was on board."

23:12:52 Morris says to Ather, "You name it that 'cause it can invoke storms?"

23:12:52 Vernos Bailey asks, "So how does this thing charge?"

23:12:54 Ather Jammoa says, "I feel like it's missing upgrades."

23:13:01 Ather Jammoa nods to Morris Corlew.

23:13:01 Melinda Michaels says, "Furnace."

23:13:02 Morris says to Vernos, "Furnace."

23:13:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "You throw people in furnace."

23:13:14 Eli Grey asks, "It's too small for a furnace, isn't it?"

23:13:16 Ather Jammoa says, "Yep, people closest to cadethood are tossed in first."

23:13:18 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "You're first in line."

23:13:19 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "We can start with you."

23:13:24 Vernos Bailey smirks.

23:13:26 Ather says to Eli, "Oh, no, invocation uses solar panels."

23:13:29 Morris Corlew laughs.

23:13:41 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

23:14:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Honestly, I'm hoping that we find a planet where we might want to do some extended observations. Cause Invocation even running at minimal power may want to recharge within a week or so."

23:14:19 Vernos Bailey asks, "So how does the furnace work?"

23:14:28 Morris Corlew says, "Ya shovel debris into it."

23:14:29 Melinda Michaels says, "We turn it on and shovel debris into it."

23:14:32 Eli says to Vernos, "The power of shovelling."

23:14:35 Vernos Bailey says, "Ah."

23:14:36 Vernos Bailey nods.

23:14:38 Damien Goss says, "We go shovel stuff into it, and it burns the stuff to generate power."

23:14:43 Ather says to Vernos, "Clearly, you don't know how to read."

23:14:43 Sarah Bellamy says, "I haven't had to ever edo that yet I don't think."

23:14:50 Eli says to Vernos, "Prepare yourself for manual labor."

23:14:50 Morris Corlew nods. "Sorta like the Beast when it was up."

23:14:52 Eli Grey grins.

23:14:52 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.
Melinda Michaels strolls south.

23:14:54 Ather Jammoa says, "All that stuff is covered in grandly superior AEU pilot's guide to starships and upgrades."

23:15:10 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:15:10 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

23:15:10 Vernos says to Ather, "Have not really focused on exploration stuff."

23:15:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Look under the...uh."

23:15:11 Morris Corlew says, "I'm maybe odd, but I enjoy it."

23:15:14 Ather Jammoa says, "Farport section."

23:15:17 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:15:22 Melinda Michaels says, "24% charge."

23:15:26 Morris Corlew nods.

23:15:39 Morris says to Melinda, "How low we goin before we stop to charge up?"

23:15:47 Ather Jammoa says, "Nissi's call, probably."

23:15:56 Melinda says to Morris, "That's up to Nissi."

23:16:01 Morris says to Ather, "Yeah, figured she mighta said though."

23:16:05 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

23:16:06 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "At 24%, I'd honestly recharge at the next point of interest, but well, that's just me. Security blanket and all!"

23:16:17 Melinda Michaels says, "She said not 50% so I am thinking lower than where we are now."

23:16:21 Morris Corlew nods.

23:16:32 Ather says to Melinda, "Well, now we're technically less than quarter charge."

23:16:36 Morris Corlew puts a small black leather portfolio in a metallic silver messenger bag.

23:16:45 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:16:49 Melinda says to Ather, "I went below 10% on mine before charging."

23:16:53 Morris Corlew picks up a sheet of green paper.

23:16:57 Morris Corlew removes a small black leather portfolio from a metallic silver messenger bag for a moment.

23:16:57 Morris Corlew puts a sheet of green paper in a small black leather portfolio.

23:17:06 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:17:31 Ather says to an icky plastic cockroach, "Speed us on our way merrily, mighty cockroach. Save us from these slower speeds by your glorious intervention."

23:17:40 Morris Corlew laughs.

23:17:44 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

23:17:50 Morris says to Ather, "You and that cockroach."

23:18:01 Ather Jammoa says, "It is glorious riftcockroach."

23:18:07 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:18:21 Ather Jammoa says, "I still don't know how it came to me."

23:18:26 Ather Jammoa says, "But oh well."

23:18:32 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:18:37 Morris says to Ather, "Gift from the rift."

23:18:38 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:18:42 Ather says to Morris, "You do, don't you!? Who gave it to me?"

23:18:48 Ather Jammoa glares at Morris Corlew.

23:18:49 Morris says to Ather, "I have no idea."

23:18:55 Ather hmphs.

23:18:57 Melinda Michaels says, "Probably Morris."

23:19:08 Ather says to Melinda, "Please bring the lie detector, and a set of restraints."

23:19:12 Morris says to Ather, "Coulda been Jeeeves for all I knkow."

23:19:20 Melinda Michaels nods to Ather Jammoa. "Good idea."

23:19:36 Morris Corlew says, "Or uh..."

23:19:37 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:19:41 Damien Goss says, "We are right at 1000 light years, give ro take a few. By my addition we've travelled about 128.8 LTC."

23:19:45 Morris Corlew asks, "Even uh...what's its name?"

23:19:49 Morris Corlew snaps his fingers and snaps his fingers.

23:19:55 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Euclid!"

23:19:58 Ather Jammoa says, "All hail Euclid."

23:19:58 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa. "Yep."

23:20:10 Ather says to Morris, "You must never forget the grand entity known as Euclid."

23:20:16 Melinda says to Morris, "Na, I think it was you. You deal in fake poop and such."

23:20:24 Morris says to Ather, "I have never met the grand entity known as Euclid."

23:20:31 Morris says to Melinda, "I'm not the only one I'm sure."

23:20:32 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

23:20:35 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, well, you'll be pretty creeped out if you do."

23:20:35 Melinda says to Damien, "Probably 130ish."

23:20:40 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

23:20:54 Ather Jammoa says, "He doesn't actually use a "voice" to talk. He talks in your head."

23:21:09 Damien Goss shrugs. "If we've gotten past 130 then there are LTC that aren't recorded."

23:21:19 Morris scratches his head and nods slowly to Ather.

23:21:34 Melinda says to Damien, "That's what I am figuring, those storms and stops."

23:21:39 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

23:21:55 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:21:58 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:22:24 Damien Goss nods. "I just added those into the distance from the last mainframe calculation."

23:22:43 Eli Grey says, "How often do you guys run into that stuff out here anyways? I know the snowglobe used to make lots of appearences when the drive was first released to civilians."

23:23:00 Eli Grey says, "We used to run through and do a snowglobe check everytime we popped into the rift."

23:23:08 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

23:23:25 Morris Corlew says, "If you go by the boards, just shy of 133LTC."

23:23:31 Melinda Michaels asks, "See?"

23:23:33 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

23:23:51 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:24:01 Morris Corlew says, "All the distances were recorded at the repair stops, plus the just over 18 we've traveled since the last stop."

23:24:07 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:27:30 Damien Goss shrugs. "I must have dropped anumber somewhere."

23:27:40 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:28:10 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

23:28:10 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

23:28:18 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

23:28:21 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:28:33 Nissi Valdaire says, "30 or so hours of charge. We don't need to panic."

23:28:44 Morris Corlew says, "Panic. Everyone panic."

23:28:47 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

23:28:59 Melinda says to Nissi, "Why not? It will give us something to do besides speculate on who gave Ather his bug."

23:29:01 Eli says to Nissi, "Yeah, I'm super impressed with that battery, not worried at all."

23:29:02 Melinda Michaels grins.

23:29:08 Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:29:33 Vernos Bailey removes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" from a small cloth sack.

23:29:39 Vernos Bailey begins reading in a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

23:29:39 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

23:30:26 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:30:49 Ather says to Nissi, "You look like a battery!"

23:30:56 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

23:30:58 Morris says to Ather, "You run on batteries."

23:31:11 Morris Corlew takes a medium battery from Morris Corlew's workbench.

23:31:14 Morris Corlew gives a medium battery to Ather Jammoa.

23:31:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Actually the way my optics unit and stuff runs is pretty incredible technology."

23:31:22 Aisling the Fox says, "His face is battery. It powers my disgust for it."

23:31:27 Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:31:38 Vernos Bailey chuckles.

23:31:39 Luja Garland snickers.

23:31:42 Morris Corlew takes a small battery from Morris Corlew's workbench.

23:31:42 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "It uses something similar to a self-sustaining powe rsource, and energy from my body heat!"

23:31:43 Eli says to Nissi, "Yeah, I'm super impressed with that battery, not worried at all."

23:31:47 Morris Corlew says, "Although this is easier to swallow."

23:31:50 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at a small battery.

23:31:57 Ather Jammoa strokes a medium battery lovingly.

23:32:02 Ather Jammoa gives a medium battery to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:32:08 Ather says to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, "There you go, my sweet."

23:32:10 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says to Ather, "Wasteful."

23:32:20 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew considers a small battery thoughtfully.

23:32:21 Eli says to Ather, "You know, I don't think I'v ever heard you get upset really at folks talking about your optics. It's actually a pretty tragic story, isn't it?"

23:32:25 Ather says to Morris, "Don't you ever clal anything that I give to my embodiment of joy wasteful."

23:32:39 Ather Jammoa says, "It's a story."

23:32:39 Damien says to Morris, "Aren't you the one that gave him the battery?"

23:32:41 "Embodiment of joy?" Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew laughs at Ather Jammoa.

23:33:00 Ather Jammoa says, "I actually haven't told anyone the reason behind it. Most people are under the assumption that I wanted it for the whatever factor, but there's a slight bit more."

23:33:02 Morris says to Damien, "Yep. Didn't think he'd basically toss it in the trash. Figured he'd find somethin useful for it to do."

23:33:18 Morris says to Ather, "I don't presume. I figured you had your reasons."

23:33:19 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew shrugs.

23:33:54 Ather Jammoa nods to Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew.

23:33:59 Eli Grey says, "Oh, I thought I had heard it was some sort of mining accident. That was probably just a rumor though."

23:34:17 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

23:34:18 Morris says to Ather, "Just figured if you wanted folks to know you'd tell 'em."

23:34:23 Damien Goss shakes his head as if to himself.

23:34:38 Ather says to Morris, "Well, there was a saying from long ago...something about a secret and three people."

23:34:59 Eli Grey says, "Oh wait, it wasn't a mining accident.. I think I remember something else."

23:35:10 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

23:35:12 Eli Grey says, "Not my place to say though, probably wrong anyways."

23:35:16 Damien Goss says, "The only way to keep a secret with three people is to kill two of them."

23:35:20 Ather Jammoa pats Damien Goss on the back.

23:35:36 Ather Jammoa says, "And I'm not really down for killing anyone."

23:35:44 Damien Goss says, "I know no secrets, of any kinds. Nope not me."

23:35:49 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew grins at Damien Goss.

23:35:56 Ather says to Damien, "Hey damien, we must go converse in the airlock! Come come."

23:35:58 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

23:36:07 Damien Goss asks, "Oh?"

23:36:07 Luja Garland snickers.

23:36:11 Ather Jammoa chortles.

23:36:15 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:36:18 Ather turns to the rift console and gives it an idle glance.

23:36:21 Damien Goss says, "I have no idea what you are talking about."

23:36:38 Ather Jammoa says, "Grand cockroach has failed me."

23:36:44 Ather Jammoa says, "I guess he cannot always be around to answer my overtures."

23:36:52 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

23:36:57 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew asks, "Speaking of...where's Lorna?"

23:37:02 Damien Goss says, "That's not horrible speed."

23:37:03 Ather Jammoa says, "Who."

23:37:04 Vernos Bailey asks, "Either that or he is just a plastic toy?"

23:37:11 Damien Goss says, "We were down to like 970 earlier today."

23:37:14 Morris says to Ather, "Lorna. Rift goddess."

23:37:16 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew gestures vaguely.

23:37:21 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh."

23:37:30 Morris says to Ather, "Mermaid in Mel's aquarium."

23:37:31 Ather says to Vernos, "For being mean to the cockroach, I am going to introduce you to something."

23:37:38 Ather Jammoa removes a model of the menacing Outsider mothership known as Zmnyi Mmyaz from a midnight blue backpack.

23:37:42 Morris says to Vernos, "Nice knowin ya."

23:37:49 Damien Goss grins.

23:37:55 Ather Jammoa aims a model of the menacing Outsider mothership known as Zmnyi Mmyaz at Vernos Bailey as it emits a high-pitched whine. Suddenly, its phased destabilizing beam shoots out! ...which turns out to be a stream of slime that covers Vernos Bailey's forehead.

23:38:09 Ather Jammoa says, "Now let's all sit back in amusement and watch him try to wipe it off."

23:38:26 Ather sits back and smiles delightedly as he glances around the observation deck.

23:38:29 Ather Jammoa puts a model of the menacing Outsider mothership known as Zmnyi Mmyaz in a midnight blue backpack.

23:38:38 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "Awww."

23:38:42 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

23:38:53 Eli Grey arches an eyebrow.

23:39:20 Morris covers his mouth and laughs, while looking at Vernos and the slime on his forehead.

23:39:31 Damien Goss says, "That looks like it's going to require a shower."

23:39:36 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

23:39:43 Ather says to Damien, "Na, shower won't help."

23:39:49 Damien Goss winces.

23:39:56 Ather Jammoa says, "It's a pretty special compound."

23:40:03 Damien Goss asks, "Not epoxy I hope?"

23:40:05 Morris shakes in silent laugher and watches Vernos.

23:40:16 Ather Jammoa chuckles and shakes his head.

23:40:30 Ather Jammoa says, "It only dissolves after a long while of exposure to oxygen. Otherwise, it's pretty perminent."

23:40:35 Damien Goss says, "Oh damn."

23:40:35 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "It's a great shade of green."

23:40:37 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

23:40:59 Eli Grey asks, "A shower gun won't help?"

23:41:03 Eli Grey removes a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

23:41:11 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew shrugs. "Don't think so."

23:41:21 Eli Grey deftly inserts a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer into a charcoal gray leather gadget bag with lightning speed.

23:41:21 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

23:41:24 Eli Grey digs around in a small bag of Chippy's Chips, coming up with a big chip. He pops it into his mouth. Crunch! Crunch!

23:41:36 Ather says to Eli, "Hey, gimme a chip?"

23:41:38 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Please!"

23:41:40 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:41:45 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:41:56 Eli Grey gives a small bag of Chippy's Chips to Ather Jammoa.

23:41:59 Damien says to Ather, "You had to complain about the speed, didn't you."

23:42:05 Eli Grey says, "You can have the rest if you want it."

23:42:06 Eli Grey shrugs.

23:42:14 Ather idly grabs a chip from the bag, munching contentedly on it before giving the bag back to Eli.

23:42:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, I'm trying to lose weight."

23:42:20 Ather Jammoa gives a small bag of Chippy's Chips to Eli Grey.

23:42:21 Eli Grey grins.

23:42:21 Eli Grey nods.

23:42:24 Eli Grey gets a last medium-sized chip from a small bag of Chippy's Chips and eats it.

23:42:29 Eli Grey upends a small bag of Chippy's Chips and funnels several small broken chips into his mouth. He then crumples up the empty bag and disposes of it.

23:43:02 Vernos says to Ather, "I'll give you 5 mil for that."

23:43:10 Damien Goss laughs.

23:43:20 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew asks, "Five...mill?"

23:43:26 Ather Jammoa says, "Hmm."

23:43:28 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "I doubt Ather'd take 50 bill."

23:43:33 Ather Jammoa says, "Let me come up with appropriate diplomatic response."

23:43:37 Ather Jammoa says, "Processing..."

23:43:42 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew shakes his head.

23:43:43 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew grins.

23:43:44 Sarah Bellamy stands up from Morris Corlew's lap.

23:43:46 Damien sticks his fingers in his ears.

23:43:46 Sarah Bellamy waves.

23:43:47 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tail.

23:43:50 Vernos Bailey says, "This will be bad."

23:43:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Appropriate diplomatic response generated."

23:43:54 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "Mmhmm."

23:43:54 Sarah Bellamy says, "Night guys."

23:43:55 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Fuck you!"

23:43:58 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew waves to Sarah Bellamy.

23:43:58 Sarah Bellamy bebops south.
Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:44:04 Luja Garland says into the PA microphone, "See you, Sarah!"

23:44:04 Vernos Bailey chuckles at Ather Jammoa.

23:44:07 Damien Goss says, "Well that was quieter than I expected."

23:44:07 Morris says to Ather, "That's diplomatic."

23:44:18 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night Luja!"

23:44:23 Ather says to Morris, "Always diplomacy."

23:44:27 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

23:44:31 Luja Garland stands up.

23:44:32 Luja Garland steps south.

23:44:46 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew glances around at his surroundings and gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:44:54 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

23:45:02 Luja Garland begins sitting comfortably cross-legged on a floor pillow.

23:45:12 Ather Jammoa says, "I swear I think it's missing something."

23:45:14 Ather Jammoa frowns.

23:45:17 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew asks, "What?"

23:45:21 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, sorry."

23:45:27 Ather Jammoa says, "I went back to thinking about my bolt's upgrades."

23:45:31 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "Oh."

23:45:37 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "Storm detector."

23:45:38 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

23:45:39 Ather Jammoa says, "It's like either it's missing something or there's something missing from the status screens."

23:45:46 Ather Jammoa says, "No, no. It has one of those."

23:45:59 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew puts a small battery on Morris Corlew's workbench.

23:46:42 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean I know this ship has the science vessel databank, but invication can't get that. So that's not what it is."

23:46:58 Ather Jammoa says, "But I figure Nissi and I are about on par explorationpoint wise."

23:47:00 Damien Goss asks, "Farport upgrades all there?"

23:47:03 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:47:09 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, yepyepyep. Save for the furnace."

23:47:14 Damien Goss nods.

23:47:22 Damien Goss asks, "Thermal reclamation?"

23:49:17 Damien Goss says, "You know, it's probably an upgrade that won't fit on that ship like the long range NDB."

23:49:30 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Long-range NDB does fit on the bolt, and I have it!"

23:49:33 Damien Goss says, "Oh."

23:49:42 Damien Goss says, "Then the answer is obvious."

23:49:47 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly west.

23:49:49 Damien Goss says, "You forgot the rift drive."

23:49:53 Ather Jammoa glares at Damien Goss.

23:50:00 Damien Goss smiles at Ather Jammoa.

23:52:16 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:57:33 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

23:57:40 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.
