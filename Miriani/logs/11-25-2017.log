["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent star
12:12 ship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a bright turquoise cooler, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a purple velvet artifact storage container, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a pink handheld planetary surveyor here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer.

A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a medium bright purple antique rug, a cherry wood table, an enormous purple beanbag chair, a pink starship simulator, a mat white wooden hanging planter, and a multicolor striped beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

Subject: Christmas time again? Oh dear!

Reference: 88727   |   Votes: 0  /  0
-------------------------------------------
The holidays are almost upon us! It's time to request your Christmas gifts once again. If you're not into snowflakes and cheer, feel free to type SCROOGE
to opt out of all christmas happenings, including getting a present from Santa. You will not be able to opt back in, so be sure you are sure about your
scrooginess before confirming the command. As the excitement of the gift-giving season approaches, we elves ask that you follow a few simple rules when
requesting your gifts from santa this year.

* Santa won't make violent weapons, droids, or anything that requires points to get normally.
* Be very detailed. Provide painful amounts of detail. If we have to fill in the blanks and you don't like what we did, you won't be able to change it.
* Once an item is complete, it cannot be added to unless you use a tradesman item.
* Food dispensing things are limited to 20 items.
* Items cannot stun or otherwise incapacitate another player. See rule number one.
* Santa may also refuse any request for any reason. This can be a balance reason, a work reason, a conflict of interest, or anything else. If your item
is refused, you will receive a letter in the mail.
* No item renames/redescriptions/additions will be accepted this year. Everything must be an original item so that it can be wrapped and/or delivered at
a holiday shindig. this means no requesting verbs for your already existing pet giraffe. The item must be able to be crammed--I mean carefully placed in
a box and wrapped.
* Assists regarding adding things to your items, asking when your item will be done, or requesting another item will be force cancelled. Santa is very
busy! If you repeatedly assist about your item, you might risk losing it entirely.
* Please only send letters. Do not send packages to Santa! He's never been the same since the flaming proboscis monkey feces incident of 2353.
* Santa is all into spreading cheer, but not in "that" way. He won't be making babies for anybody anymore! Not since that messy lawsuit...
* Likewise, Santa's tired of mucking stalls. He's not dealing in animals this year. No sir. What kind of jerk would cram a helpless kitten or horse into
a box anyway? Beside Coal the Elf that is.
* We also ask that where possible, please use a tradesman item lab to submit your request. This includes for vanities, food robots and forcefield spacesuits.
For those of you intrepid adventurers braving the mind numbing boredom of uncharted space outside communications range or known space in general, fear not. There is more than enough
Christmas cheer to go around. You simply must locate a star in the sector and then make a WISH! (Type WISH.) Santa will hear you loud and clear!

If you're in local space, Santa prefers more conventional letters.

1.) Locate a mail center. Typically these can be found on capital planets by typing MAP MAIL.
2.) Purchase a letter. (Type MENU to find letter and BUY #. It should be number five, so BUY 5.)
3.) Type WRITE LETTER.
4.) Write your request down, giving as much detail as possible.
5.) Type a single period on a line by itself.
6.) Type SEND LETTER.
7.) Type Santa Claus (that's Claus with no e.)

All letters must be received by Santa by December 20th. No new letters will be accepted after this date. Tears will not sway us. We're elves, not pixies.
If you've had a letter rejected on or after the 20th, you have until the 23rd to express mail it to Santa. No letters at all will be accepted after December
23rd. As a final note, have mercy on us elves. there are a lot of pilots to make gifts for. While we realize this may be one of the only chances some of
you have to request an item, now is not the time to request the most complicated thing you can possibly think of. Bear in mind that we have more than 90
requests to fill every year, and that takes up a lot of time here at the cheerful holiday workshop.

Get those letters in, and have a happy holiday season!
