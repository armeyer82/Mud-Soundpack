-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
01:45:30 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:45:38 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers here.
You can go east.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.)

01:45:41  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a stormy pair of trousers, and a pair of white socks. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:45:41 You are carrying nothing.

01:46:20 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:46:25 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]

01:47:13 I see no "lily" here.

01:47:17 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:47:18 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

01:47:23 There appear to be about 20 pilots recently active.

01:51:23 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

01:51:53 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I was so happy to get over Exploration cap a few months ago. I see it coming!"

01:53:17 Lily Kaise says, "Oh not so so not going there."

01:53:19 You chuckle.

01:53:24 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

01:53:27 Lily cringes.

01:53:38 Morris Corlew says, "Not that bad. Just...in name only really...usually...occasionally..."

01:53:39 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

01:55:52 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

01:59:18 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:01:17 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:02:11 Lily Kaise gives a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:02:49 Lily Kaise runs a small silver genetic tester slowly over a maple coffee table as the device blinks a light and beeps softly.

02:03:17 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:03:41 Eli Grey dashes in from the south.

02:03:46 Lily Kaise waves to Eli Grey.

02:05:04 Eli Grey exclaims, "Thank you!"

02:05:08 Damien Goss nods to Eli Grey.

02:05:52 Eli Grey says, "I wish I had brought a regular camera too. I'd like to get a picture of as many of us together as I can before we all start going about our business back home again."

02:05:52 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:06:01 Eli Grey says, "I'm sure one of you folks has one."

02:06:03 Lily Kaise squeezes Eli Grey affectionately.

02:06:07 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:06:08 Damien Goss opens a camera bag.
Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

02:06:11 Morris says to Eli, "Goss has been takin some I think."

02:06:12 Damien Goss removes a metallic camera with a chain link strap from a camera bag.

02:08:48 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:09:11 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:09:14 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

02:09:17 Lily Kaise puts down a bulky silver-colored posterizer.

02:09:24 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

02:09:29 Lily Kaise gives Eli Grey some credits.

02:09:39 Eli Grey blinks.

02:09:41 Eli Grey asks, "Huh?"

02:09:50 Lily Kaise says to Eli, "If you would be so kind as to make a blacklight poster of that, I would be thrilled!"

02:09:56 Lily Kaise says, "The 5 stars."

02:10:06 Eli Grey says, "Oh of the five stars, sure,  that sounds pretty wicked actually."

02:10:08 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:10:09 You say to Eli, "I'd like one too."

02:10:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it would be the awesomest."

02:17:20 Vernos Bailey runs a space imaging photograph of five stars in very close proximity through a bulky silver-colored posterizer, turning it into a glossy full color poster.

02:17:24 Lily Kaise says, "I'll hang it in my office."

02:17:27 a blacklight poster of five stars in very close proximity

02:17:27 The image has been reproduced in purple and blue tones, and will look most spectacular under a blacklight.

Five stars orbit each other here in a complicated ballet, both dwarf stars and main sequence stars. Readings indicate this formation is probably unstable; within a few million years, one or more of the stars may end up ejected from the system.
A hardcopy of sensor readings is printed in the bottom-right corner, alongside the label "Star System 8351-5746."
Vernos Bailey puts a space imaging photograph of five stars in very close proximity in a small cloth sack.

02:17:36 You look at a blacklight poster of five stars in very close proximity and smile.

02:17:43 You put a blacklight poster of five stars in very close proximity in a leather briefcase.

02:17:50 Vernos Bailey says, "I need one of these to posterize all my space images."

02:17:54 Lily Kaise grins.

02:17:57 You grin.

02:18:00 You say, "They're awesome."

02:18:05 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, that was a good choice for a blacklight poster for real."

02:18:09 Eli Grey puts a space imaging photograph of five stars in very close proximity in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:18:27 The room turns very cold, and then a large, resounding crash echoes throughout the ship.

02:18:27 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:18:30 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

02:18:31 Lily Kaise says, "I'll leave it here for you all to use as much as you want."

02:18:35 Morris Corlew asks, "The heck?"

02:18:36 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

02:18:37 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:18:39 Eli Grey smiles at Lily Kaise.

02:18:43 Lily Kaise grins.

02:18:48 Morris Corlew asks, "Where'd that come from?"

02:18:50 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:18:55 Eli Grey asks, "Hey.. who did that?"

02:18:59 Morris Corlew asks, "Did what?"

02:19:00 Eli Grey says, "Someone messing with my hair."

02:19:02 You hear feet running from the room, despite seeing no one there.

02:19:02 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:19:04 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

02:19:05 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:19:09 Morris Corlew says, "I uh..."

02:19:11 You glance around at your surroundings.

02:19:15 Morris touches his throat.

02:19:16 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah what's up with this thing."

02:19:18 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

02:19:23 You wave to Rogue Romano.

02:19:28 Vernos Bailey says, "I will take the speed."

02:19:30 Eli Grey says, "Woo there's Rogue! Now just need Sarah and I can get my photo."

02:19:34 Morris says to Lily, "Storm out of nowhere."

02:19:38 Morris says to Eli, "And Emily."

02:19:46 I see no "emily" here.

02:19:49 You nod.

02:19:57 Vernos Bailey removes a space imaging photograph of Spaceman Roger's Station from a small cloth sack.

02:19:58 Eli Grey says, "Oh yep."

02:20:00 Eli Grey says, "And Emily."

02:20:04 Vernos Bailey removes a space imaging photograph of five stars in very close proximity from a small cloth sack.

02:20:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah pretty crazy because thought I had checked the rift display just a tiltle while ago."

02:20:07 Vernos Bailey puts a space imaging photograph of five stars in very close proximity in a small cloth sack.

02:20:08 Rogue Romano waves.

02:20:09 Vernos Bailey removes a space imaging photograph of Spaceman Roger's Station from a small cloth sack.

02:20:11 Vernos Bailey puts a space imaging photograph of Spaceman Roger's Station in a small cloth sack.

02:20:26 Vernos Bailey says, "Hm."

02:20:32 "Me too." Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "There had been a storm, but it disappeared from sensors some time ago."

02:20:37 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wow."

02:20:39 Eli Grey removes a space imaging photograph of Space Station Alpha from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:20:51 Eli says to Lily, "You should have busted this thing out days ago."

02:20:52 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:20:55 Eli Grey says, "You were holding out."

02:20:56 Eli Grey grins.

02:20:58 Lily Kaise says, "I've seen this type before it's a weirdo."

02:21:05 Morris says to Lily, "The storm?"

02:21:06 You chuckle at Eli Grey.

02:21:09 Lily Kaise nods.

02:21:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:21:18 Morris Corlew says, "Showed no type on sensors, if it's the same one."

02:21:20 Vernos Bailey says, "I will send the QE comm that I spoke to nissi about when we start going straight up."

02:21:23 Eli Grey asks, "Did anyone else feel someone messing with their hair? And then here someone running out of hte room?"

02:21:28 You nod.

02:21:30 You say, "I did."

02:21:31 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

02:21:36 You feel a pinch on your leg.

02:21:36 Eli loks oddly relieved.
The room grows a bit more chill.

02:21:38 Morris says to Eli, "It's uh...normal in this riftscape."

02:21:39 Morris Corlew says, "Ouch."

02:21:40 Eli Grey says, "Ouch."

02:21:42 Rogue Romano says, "I hear someone runnin' just as I came out of my room."

02:21:43 Lily Kaise says, "Wow I just felt a big chill."

02:21:43 Vernos Bailey says, "The fuck."

02:21:47 Damien Goss says, "I have no hair, so no to the first."

02:21:48 Vernos Bailey says, "I got pinched."

02:21:54 Morris Corlew says, "Haunted house."

02:21:54 Rogue Romano asks, "Erm, who pinched me?"

02:21:55 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

02:21:57 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:22:00 Eli Grey says, "This place sucks."

02:22:01 You hear receding laughter.

02:22:01 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:22:17 Rogue Romano examines a small hot chocolate dispenser robot for a moment.

02:22:20 Rogue Romano presses a shiny red button on a small hot chocolate dispenser robot and helps herself to a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

02:22:29 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:22:31 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

02:22:40 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

02:22:41 Eli Grey runs a space imaging photograph of Space Station Alpha through a bulky silver-colored posterizer, turning it into a glossy full color poster.

02:22:48 Eli Grey says, "Awesome."

02:22:51 Eli Grey puts a space imaging photograph of Space Station Alpha in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:23:10 Lily says to Eli, "Sorry I brought it just for this sort of thing and it's been sitting back in the storeroom on the hover... sorry."

02:23:20 Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise.

02:23:21 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:23:30 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Never to laaaaate!"

02:23:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:23:35 You laugh.

02:23:37 Eli Grey says, "Hey, probably a good thing. If we had it from the start we might have gotten bored with it by now."

02:23:42 Eli Grey chuckles.

02:23:44 Lily Kaise says, "True."

02:23:44 You say, "True true."

02:24:12 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:24:13 Vernos Bailey asks, "Was it still 5 LTCs and 3 east or did we skip the 5?"

02:24:13 Eli carefully rolls up a glossy full color poster of Space Station Alpha.

02:24:20 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:24:20 Eli Grey puts a glossy full color poster of Space Station Alpha in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:24:31 Lily Kaise removes a starship requisition application from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:24:35 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:24:48 Eli says to Vernos, "Hey did you get the note I left for you?"

02:24:49 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm what's this one for."

02:24:54 Vernos Bailey nods to Eli Grey.

02:24:57 Vernos Bailey pats a small cloth sack lightly.

02:24:59 Eli Grey smiles.

02:25:00 Eli Grey pats Vernos Bailey on the back.

02:25:00 Lily Kaise says, "Hah."

02:25:14 Lily Kaise says, "A Pincer that I'll probably not get."

02:25:22 Lily Kaise puts a starship requisition application in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:25:33 Eli Grey asks, "Would it be alright if I take a look at the application for that?"

02:25:36 Lily Kaise removes a blacklight poster of five stars in very close proximity from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:25:36 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

02:25:40 Vernos Bailey says, "I got one for the flare but no where near the points to get it yet."

02:25:53 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

02:25:56 Morris Corlew says, "She said on the board just go 3 east."

02:26:00 Vernos Bailey removes a starship requisition application from a small cloth sack.

02:26:01 You say to Lily, "Yeah, the same pincer that I'll probably never get either."

02:26:02 Morris Corlew says, "Well...east and slightly down."

02:26:06 Eli says to Vernos, "I'm not a huge combat guy, but still thinking about getting one of those if I can approved, for invasions and stuff."

02:26:27 Vernos Bailey puts a starship requisition application in a small cloth sack.

02:26:33 Morris Corlew sighs to himself.

02:26:42 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/All.

02:26:45 You say, "I keep applying for the Flare and pincer and can't get either."

02:26:53 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:26:55 Shule sighs sadly.

02:26:56 You feel a pinch on your leg.

02:26:56 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:27:05 Morris Corlew frowns.

02:27:06 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:27:08 You hear receding laughter.

02:27:09 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:27:09 Lily Kaise says, "Ow dude don't pinch me like that."

02:27:11 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:27:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:27:14 You laugh.

02:27:17 Eli Grey asks, "I'ts not gonna void your application or anything if I take a look at it is it?"

02:27:19 You say to Lily, "Couldn't help it."

02:27:36 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:27:48 Lily says to Eli, "So you wanted to see the pincer one?"

02:27:53 Melinda says to Eli, "I never looked before applying, you can do it."

02:27:59 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

02:28:03 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:28:11 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:28:24 Eli says to Melinda, "I'm just curious, I thought hte questions for the sightseer were interesting."

02:28:33 Eli Grey nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

02:28:38 Eli Grey says, "Er."

02:28:42 Eli rubs his eyes.

02:28:44 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

02:28:52 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

02:28:55 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:28:58 Eli Grey says, "I'll probably never apply for a Pincer but it'd be interesting to see what kinds of questions they ask."

02:29:00 Lily says to Eli, "Was it the Pincer you wanted to see?"

02:29:07 Vernos Bailey says, "We are at 2.28 currently."

02:29:12 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

02:29:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Morris."

02:29:19 Lily Kaise removes a starship requisition application from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:29:26 Eli Grey says, "I wouldn't mind looking at both to be honest.."

02:29:27 Damien Goss switches a white swivel einrophone off.

02:29:40 Eli Grey says, "Although I'm sure the questions are not much different."

02:29:43 Jason Rat navigates his sky blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:29:45 Lily Kaise gives a starship requisition application to Eli Grey.

02:29:52 Morris says to Vernos, "What?"

02:29:53 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

02:30:02 Lily Kaise removes a starship requisition application from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:30:05 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:30:10 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

02:30:11 Vernos says to Morris, "We are at 2.28 LTCs currently."

02:30:16 Morris Corlew says, "1.36 plus 3."

02:30:20 Morris Corlew says, "And yeah, I see the status."

02:30:21 Morris Corlew grins.

02:30:23 Lily Kaise says, "Oh darn I still have one for an Arrow... oh well."

02:30:31 Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise.

02:30:33 Lily Kaise says, "An arrow I can never get."

02:30:36 Eli says to Lily, "We'll get them back."

02:30:46 Eli Grey says, "It will take time, but we'll get them back."

02:30:46 Lily Kaise says, "Sure hope so."

02:31:01 Morris says to Vernos, "Need to get to 4.3 or 4.4."

02:31:06 Vernos Bailey nods.

02:31:16 Lily Kaise says, "I want to try again. Was turned down twice yet I managed the Long-Range just fine."

02:31:23 Rogue Romano turns on her metallic yellow touch einrophone and taps at it briefly.

02:31:27 Vernos Bailey says, "We just need to be more active in leading our own expeditions and such."

02:31:33 You feel a pinch on your leg.

02:31:33 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:31:33 Vernos Bailey says, "If you guys want that back."

02:31:35 Lily Kaise puts a starship requisition application in a camera bag.

02:31:44 Something brushes by you.

02:31:44 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:31:46 Rogue Romano says, "Gha, stop pinchin' me."

02:31:48 Lily Kaise says, "I guess the other one I have is for the Flare."

02:31:55 Lily Kaise removes a starship requisition application from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:32:06 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

02:32:15 Lily Kaise puts a starship requisition application in a camera bag.

02:32:28 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

02:32:36 Lily Kaise rolls around on the ground before a blacklight poster of five stars in very close proximity.

02:32:39 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:32:41 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:32:44 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

02:32:57 Eli Grey nods to Vernos Bailey.

02:33:00 Lily Kaise puts a blacklight poster of five stars in very close proximity in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:33:02 Morris says to Lily, "Lil too much wine?"

02:33:10 You grin at Morris Corlew.

02:33:17 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh not any yet. Perhaps that's my problem!"

02:33:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:33:21 Eli says to Vernos, "I'm probably going to be doing one like a week and ahlf after we get back, not as far out as this one, but still."

02:33:22 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:33:23 You laugh.

02:33:29 Morris says to Lily, "I've heard that can happen..."

02:33:58 Eli Grey says, "However long it takes me to get two more sightseers."

02:34:24 Morris says to Lily, "Curious...somebody told me you had three long-range sightseers on William Dove...is that true?"

02:34:43 Lily Kaise says, "I only have two at the moment so they're not on dove yet until I get the third."

02:34:56 Morris Corlew asks, "Ah. But they will approve more than one, or is one Shule's?"

02:35:06 Lily Kaise says, "Both are mine."

02:35:19 You feel a pinch on your leg.

02:35:20 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:35:25 Morris Corlew nods.

02:35:27 Morris rubs his leg.

02:35:32 Eli Grey taps a starship requisition application.

02:35:35 Eli Grey says, "Good questions."

02:35:41 Eli Grey gives a starship requisition application to Lily Kaise.

02:35:49 Something brushes by you.

02:35:49 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:35:51 Lily Kaise says, "So yes I suppose you could get three as I will try once I get off my lazy butt and fill in the application. I wouldn't think they would approve an infinite number though."

02:35:56 Rogue Romano asks, "So you need an application for like every sight seeer you get?"

02:35:59 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:36:01 Lily Kaise says, "Yes."

02:36:02 Eli Grey nods to Rogue Romano.

02:36:05 Rogue Romano says, "Damn."

02:36:07 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

02:36:12 Morris says to Rogue, "Yep."

02:36:16 Eli Grey says, "And can only get one per conquest period."

02:36:19 Lily Kaise nods.

02:36:20 You nod.

02:36:21 Morris Corlew says, "That I knew. I just didn't think they'd approve more than one."

02:36:24 Rogue Romano says, "I see."

02:36:45 Lily Kaise says, "Well I stated in my application I wanted them for the Platform."

02:37:20 Eli Grey says, "Mind if I see the flare application? I'ms ure the questions are roughly the same."

02:37:23 Lily Kaise says, "You would need three for their characteristics to be asimilated by the platform."

02:37:55 Morris Corlew says, "Of the exploration and combat ships I've seen, the questions of the two types seem the same."

02:37:58 Eli Grey says, "I still think that's a shame, would be much more fun if you could mix and match."

02:38:00 Morris Corlew says, "I've done two of each type."

02:38:05 Lily Kaise says, "I agree."

02:38:13 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

02:38:14 You nod.

02:38:18 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

02:38:18 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:38:20 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

02:38:27 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but you do get some more charge plus the extra living quarters."

02:38:31 You hear receding laughter.

02:38:32 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:38:35 Morris Corlew says, "I can brush my hair just fine, ya know..."

02:38:36 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:38:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:38:45 You laugh.

02:38:49 Damien Goss stands up.

02:38:51 Damien Goss waves.

02:38:52 Damien Goss steps south.

02:38:58 Eli Grey asks, "How much charge do you end up after all three?, does it just use a straight conversion?"

02:39:05 Lily Kaise says, "I did put cry tubes in one of them so that would limit my capacity."

02:39:11 Eli Grey asks, "So it would end up with.. sixty hours I guess?"

02:39:23 Morris Corlew nods.

02:39:25 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

02:39:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah seems to."

02:39:29 Morris Corlew says, "With the Fienstein."

02:39:33 Lily Kaise nods to Morris Corlew.

02:39:35 You nod.

02:39:43 Morris Corlew says, "Put a plant with charge plus on it, that goes up some."

02:39:57 Lily Kaise says, "Well I prefer the sensor plant."

02:40:08 You say, "I'd prefer the sensor plant too."

02:40:09 Morris says to Lily, "You can have both."

02:40:18 Morris Corlew says, "Charge sensor exists."

02:40:18 Lily Kaise asks, "Hmm what?"

02:40:21 Morris Corlew says, "Yes."

02:40:22 Eli Grey says, "Not sure which plant i'm gonna grab. I'm torn between the sensor plant and the charge plant. Maybe even a life-support."

02:40:25 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:40:35 Morris Corlew says, "Life support takes from."

02:40:36 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:40:46 You say, "I'd rather have the double sensor plant."

02:40:51 Morris Corlew says, "Either charge or rift sensors."

02:40:56 Lily Kaise says, "Speaking of plants, I can't wait to see what we get. We are so close to qualifying for the lab."

02:40:59 Morris says to you, "We've got that."

02:41:07 You say to Morris, "I know."

02:41:13 Eli Grey says, "I wish I hadn't returned that deep sensing array blueprint."

02:41:16 Eli Grey snaps his fingers.

02:41:22 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wow yeah."

02:41:23 Morris Corlew looks at Eli Grey thoughtfully.

02:41:23 Ather Jammoa says, "I'll never ever use the double sensor plant cause charge is precious woo."

02:41:36 Eli Grey says, "Oh double sensor takes from charge? Hmm."

02:41:40 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, that's no good."

02:42:00 You feel a pinch on your leg.

02:42:00 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:42:04 Morris Corlew says, "One side does. But Cats has charge/sensor hybrid."

02:42:07 Lily says to Eli, "Yeah I have to bribe Ather a lot to get those arrays."

02:42:22 You hear feet running from the room, despite seeing no one there.

02:42:22 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:42:23 Aisling the Fox says, "Double sensor plant is best."

02:42:27 Aisling the Fox says, "Oracle has it."

02:42:34 You grin at Aisling the Fox.

02:42:40 Aisling the Fox says, "Expedition sensors with double sensor plant? Yes please."

02:42:41 Ather says to Aisling, "Oracle has charge to sacrifice. The tac platform would not, really."

02:42:42 Morris Corlew says, "If you have tons of charge, sure. But tac platform doesn't."

02:42:49 Aisling the Fox nods to Ather Jammoa.

02:43:01 Lily Kaise says, "Well I like it and didn't think it cost that much in charge."

02:43:14 Melinda Michaels says, "2.94."

02:43:16 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

02:43:18 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:43:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Charge/sensor hybrid would be a far more reasonable plant to grab for exploration purposes. Bit of a boost to the sensors, bit of a boost to charge."

02:43:23 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh holy wow!"

02:43:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:43:28 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:43:31 Morris Corlew says, "It doesn't. But the few hours could be the difference between getting home and not getting home."

02:43:39 Morris Corlew says, "I have it on my carrier to make up for the high-low."

02:43:47 Lily Kaise says, "Well I have a blast chamber."

02:43:53 Morris Corlew says, "For what I use the carrier for, I have room to burn."

02:44:01 Lily Kaise says, "And the thermal reclamation thingy."

02:44:08 Morris says to Lily, "Then take what the plant takes away, multiply it by four, and it shortens your trip length by that much."

02:44:27 Melinda says to Morris, "Reets."

02:44:35 Lily Kaise says, "Well I've not had an issue so far and we've taken it out some and yeah Mr Moreets."

02:44:35 Ather Jammoa snickers.

02:44:38 Morris says to Melinda, "You told me the same thing. I'm repeating it back to you."

02:44:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:44:39 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

02:44:40 Ather Jammoa says, "I sometimes do miss Reets."

02:44:49 Eli Grey says, "I'm going to head up and get ready to change the heading. If that's alright."

02:44:50 Melinda says to Morris, "I did not go into all the detail on how to do it."

02:44:53 Morris Corlew says, "Hey, I'm just echoing something Mel told me."

02:44:53 Ather says to Eli, "Wait, you gave back your bloh, wait a minute, I think I remember Kesi saying that."

02:44:54 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

02:44:57 Morris says to Melinda, "Yeah ya did."

02:44:58 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet and absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:44:58 Morris Corlew grins.

02:44:58 Lily Kaise says, "I miss him too unless he is nagging me about something."

02:45:03 Melinda says to Morris, "Nope."

02:45:05 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

02:45:10 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:45:19 Aisling the Fox says, "Morreets."

02:45:21 Lily Kaise says, "He was just so bad I turned off my phone."

02:45:23 Morris says to Melinda, "Mmhmm. YOu told me it takes four times more than I think because of the recharge of the furnace."

02:45:29 Melinda Michaels says, "I actually dunno what y'all are even talking about."

02:45:31 Melinda Michaels laughs.

02:45:35 Morris Corlew laughs at Melinda Michaels.

02:45:35 You laugh at Melinda Michaels.

02:45:36 Eli says to Ather, "Yeah, someone got me all paranoid about the way I got it, whihc clearly was unfounded since I've never heard anyone having any problems for it."

02:45:41 Ather says to Eli, "Na."

02:45:47 Ather Jammoa says, "You could've been capitalizing on it like me."

02:45:49 Melinda says to Morris, "What are you talking about?"

02:45:49 Ather Jammoa sighs at Eli Grey.

02:45:53 Ather Jammoa says, "All this time I thought you still had it."

02:46:00 Lily Kaise says, "It's ok I still like better sensors."

02:46:15 Ather says to Eli, "I started charging golden tael for them. Imagine!"

02:46:25 Lily Kaise shakes a purple silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered mystic purple cats for some reason.

02:46:28 Eli Grey says, "Nope, I returned it, can't seem to get it back."

02:46:33 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

02:46:47 Ather says to Eli, "You're an invader. We'd work something out for you."

02:46:52 Eli Grey says, "I shoudl write to them and see, because I wrote to the station controler and explained why I returned it, maybe they will understand."

02:46:55 Ather Jammoa says, "You'd get freebies long as you provide parts."

02:46:59 Eli Grey grins at Ather Jammoa.

02:47:04 Melinda says to Morris, "What takes 4 times longer?"

02:47:22 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah we can't get them anymore so hope you can get it back Eli."

02:47:26 Ather Jammoa says, "If you don't provide parts though, yeah, you're gona pay."

02:47:27 Morris says to Melinda, "Double sensor plant takes the charge it takes time four because of the furnace for entire trip length."

02:47:31 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

02:47:38 Lily Kaise says, "I tried."

02:47:44 Melinda says to Morris, "That's not what I said."

02:47:50 Morris Corlew looks at Melinda Michaels thoughtfully.

02:47:55 Eli Grey asks, "Wasn't there some kidn of auto-tacking robot too?"

02:48:00 Morris says to Melinda, "You told me to factor in four recharges and it would take that much off."

02:48:00 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

02:48:06 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Sensing arrays, sensing arrays for sale! For the low low price of 7 golden taels with no parts!"

02:48:11 Eli Grey says, "Laugh."

02:48:12 Melinda says to Morris, "That was a general statement, with furnaces and charge power."

02:48:20 Morris says to Melinda, "Which is what I told her."

02:48:28 Morris says to Melinda, "And what I said you'd said."

02:48:32 Melinda says to Morris, "It's got nothing to do with the plant."

02:48:36 You feel a pinch on your leg.

02:48:36 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:48:39 Melinda Michaels says, "It's that way regardless."

02:48:40 Morris says to Melinda, "The plant takes from charge."

02:48:46 Eli Grey dashes south.

02:48:46 Ather Jammoa says, "Harharharharhar."

02:48:53 Melinda Michaels says, "That's why you get a charge and sensor plant."

02:48:53 Ather Jammoa stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

02:48:55 Ather Jammoa strides south.

02:49:01 Morris says to Melinda, "Yes, that's what I was telling Lily."

02:49:01 Something brushes by you.
The room grows a bit warmer.

02:49:18 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:49:30 Melinda says to Morris, "Yes but that times 4 thing is not because of the plant. That is wehre you confused me."

02:49:50 Vernos Bailey asks, "We still hitting 2000?"

02:49:53 Melinda says to Morris, "Told you I had no idea of what you were talking about."

02:49:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Iam confused."

02:49:55 A black digital felo game beeps plaintively for food.

02:49:55 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:49:57 Morris says to Melinda, "That's how to figure how much total the plant takes off if you're using a furnace. That's the point you made to me."

02:49:59 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

02:49:59 A black digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

02:50:01 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

02:50:01 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

02:50:30 Melinda says to Morris, "Sure, I wasn't really paying attention, I just heard numbers and called you Reets."

02:50:35 Morris Corlew laughs at Melinda Michaels.

02:50:35 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:50:43 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

02:50:43 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:50:45 Morris Corlew says, "Four is a very complicated number."

02:50:45 Morris Corlew grins.

02:50:50 Melinda says to Morris, "It is."

02:50:57 Morris Corlew shakes his head and chuckles.

02:51:18 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:51:18 Aisling the Fox says, "Four dimensions makes things complicated."

02:51:26 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

02:51:43 Morris Corlew says, "That does, yes."

02:51:51 Something brushes by you.

02:51:51 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:51:55 Melinda Michaels asks, "Right, how far had we traveled when Nissi changed course?"

02:51:57 Morris twists around.

02:52:02 Morris Corlew says, "Uh...1.38."

02:52:06 Morris Corlew says, "Or 1.36 or somethin."

02:52:17 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:52:21 Melinda Michaels says, "About another LTC then."

02:52:33 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

02:52:50 Vernos Bailey says, "Just trying to figure out what to say in message I asked her if I could send."

02:52:51 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

02:52:55 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Aisling the Fox's neck.

02:52:56 Melinda says to Vernos, "Short."

02:52:58 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

02:53:04 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:53:12 Morris Corlew asks, "Uh...someone turn us?"

02:53:21 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:53:23 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:53:24 Morris Corlew lopes south.

02:53:26 Melinda says to Vernos, "Hme n wk."

02:53:33 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

02:53:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Was going to say out 2k hme n wk."

02:53:50 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "We turned?"

02:53:56 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes. Eli and Ather."

02:54:02 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

02:54:02 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:54:03 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "An LTC to soon."

02:54:12 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I told 'em."

02:54:18 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

02:54:24 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:54:26 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "My bad guys."

02:54:43 Vernos Bailey says, "So out 2k hme n wk."

02:54:46 Vernos Bailey asks, "That work?"

02:54:53 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

02:54:57 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:54:57 Melinda Michaels says, "Na."

02:55:02 Vernos Bailey says, "Or just hme n wk."

02:55:29 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh better just go with what Melinda said."

02:55:37 Morris Corlew asks, "Na?"

02:55:42 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings and chuckles.

02:56:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I figure hme n wk is best."

02:56:19 Melinda says to Vernos, "ETA wk, something like that."

02:56:37 Melinda Michaels says, "If they can't figure week for wk it's their stupidity."

02:56:41 Morris Corlew nods.

02:56:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Hme ETA wk."

02:56:59 Melinda Michaels says, "Sure."

02:57:09 Melinda Michaels says, "May be a day off but that'll be close."

02:57:14 Vernos Bailey says, "Short, simple."

02:57:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

02:57:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Love it."

02:57:20 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

02:57:20 The room grows a bit more chill.

02:57:24 Morris Corlew sighs.

02:57:25 Morris Corlew removes a hull brush from a slate blue leather gear bag.

02:57:25 Rogue Romano glances around at her surroundings.

02:57:29 Morris Corlew puts a hull brush in a slate blue leather gear bag.

02:57:32 Something brushes by you.

02:57:32 The room grows a bit warmer.

02:57:34 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

02:57:46 Aisling the Fox says, ""Greetings and salutations fellow pilots. We are currently estimating our return home to be approximately one earth week of time, giving or taking a day depending on flow of the rift.""

02:57:48 Vernos Bailey says, "I am just doing my best to ignore it."

02:57:50 Rogue Romano says, "Melinda is playin' with my hair."

02:57:52 Vernos Bailey says, "Morris."

02:57:55 Aisling the Fox says, "Send that."

02:58:05 Morris says to Vernos, "What?"

02:58:12 Melinda says to Aisling, "No."

02:58:26 Vernos Bailey says, "I am just doing my best to ignore the brushing by unknown orgins."

02:58:30 Aisling says to Melinda, "Bip."

02:58:32 Melinda Michaels asks, "We already need two people to send from accord, do we want 3?"

02:58:35 Morris says to Vernos, "Ain't me."

02:58:39 Morris Corlew laughs at Melinda Michaels.

02:58:41 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

02:59:03 Melinda Michaels asks, "Two for approval is it?"

02:59:08 Vernos Bailey nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:59:14 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

02:59:39 Vernos Bailey says, "Mister long message with bright happy disposition is responsible for that."

02:59:44 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:00:04 Rogue Romano grins.

03:01:11 Vernos says to Melinda, "Another score?"

03:01:20 Rogue Romano smirks.

03:01:32 Melinda says to Vernos, "Yup."

03:01:37 Rogue Romano asks, "Four score, how many years ago?"

03:01:56 Vernos Bailey says, "One week if you count the numbers of score I have achieved this trip."

03:02:03 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo!"

03:02:29 Rogue Romano finishes off a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

03:02:37 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:02:49 You feel a pinch on your leg.

03:02:49 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:02:56 Vernos Bailey says, "Hey as long as I don't aggrivate anyone too bad this next week home. I am hoping to get invited to more."

03:03:00 You hear receding laughter.

03:03:00 The room grows a bit warmer.

03:03:01 Morris feels the air around his leg searching for something.

03:03:19 Rogue Romano grins at Vernos Bailey.

03:03:41 Aisling says to Vernos, "I do not think you have anything to worry about."

03:03:55 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

03:03:58 Vernos Bailey asks, "Shall we tell the men up in the control room to turn us?"

03:04:06 Morris Corlew says, "Not yet."

03:04:10 Melinda Michaels says, "No."

03:04:11 Morris Corlew says, "Still a third of an LTC short."

03:04:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Calm down, we'll get there."

03:04:21 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:04:23 Rogue Romano grins.

03:04:26 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:04:26 Vernos Bailey grins.

03:04:26 You grin.

03:04:27 Melinda Michaels says, "It doesn't have to be right on the mark."

03:04:33 Morris Corlew says, "Nope. Can be 5."

03:04:35 Morris Corlew shrugs.

03:04:36 Aisling says to Vernos, "I have spoken too soon. Melinda will throttle you."

03:04:37 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

03:04:45 Melinda says to Aisling, "What?"

03:04:46 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:04:48 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:04:49 Aisling the Fox grins.

03:04:54 Rogue Romano waves to Ather Jammoa.

03:04:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Vroom vroom."

03:04:59 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

03:05:00 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:05:10 You hear feet running from the room, despite seeing no one there.

03:05:11 The room grows a bit warmer.

03:05:24 Vernos Bailey says, "She did say throttle."

03:05:30 Morris Corlew sighs. "This one always gives me the willies anymore."

03:05:32 Lily Kaise says, "Hey keep your paws out of my hair too or i'm half a mind to strangle you with it."

03:05:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:05:38 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

03:05:45 You say to Lily, "No strangeling me with your hair."

03:05:55 You say, "Strangling."

03:05:57 Rogue Romano smirks.

03:06:06 Vernos Bailey asks, "Is that a new kink I should be aware of?"

03:06:07 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Naa not you, that creep who keeps messing with my hair!"

03:06:16 Rogue Romano asks, "Creep?"

03:06:19 Melinda Michaels says, "It's not me. I am only messing with Rogue's."

03:06:19 You chuckle at Vernos Bailey.

03:06:22 Morris says to Rogue, "Rift creep."

03:06:24 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:06:40 Vernos Bailey says, "Breathe control using hair."

03:06:49 Rogue says to Morris, "Think my rift creep is Mel, and I'm quite happy with that."

03:06:54 You laugh.

03:06:59 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:06:59 You grin.

03:07:03 Rogue Romano grins.

03:07:20 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

03:07:20 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:07:48 Vernos Bailey says, "I do want to go back using the realitiy bubble just to see the difference."

03:07:58 Aisling the Fox says, "It is reality."

03:08:01 Melinda Michaels says, "The only difference is no rift scenes."

03:08:01 Morris says to Vernos, "There's just...nothing."

03:08:02 Aisling the Fox says, "That is the difference."

03:08:04 Morris Corlew nods.

03:08:05 Something brushes by you.

03:08:05 The room grows a bit warmer.

03:09:44 Vernos says to Morris, "Hey sometimes I enjoy curiousity."

03:09:46 Ather Jammoa says, "I think everyone scared Eli too much for him to turn now."

03:09:53 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

03:09:54 The room grows a bit warmer.

03:09:54 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Turn."

03:10:00 You feel fingers brushing your hair.

03:10:01 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:10:14 Morris says to Vernos, "Nothin at all wrong with curiosity, long as ya don't do somethin dumb in the name of it."

03:10:16 Vernos Bailey presses a few buttons on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, sending a message.

03:10:16 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly, indicating that it has begun sending a message.

03:10:22 Ather Jammoa glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:10:23 Aisling the Fox glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:10:25 You hear feet running from the room, despite seeing no one there.

03:10:26 The room grows a bit warmer.

03:10:26 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:10:37 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Probably a tenth or two off but it's good."

03:10:42 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:10:42 Ather Jammoa says, "I'd be surprised if we made it in a week."

03:10:45 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

03:10:51 Morris Corlew says, "Close enough."

03:10:53 Vernos Bailey says, "That was what I was told to send."

03:10:55 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

03:11:01 Melinda Michaels says, "A week to eight days is my guess."

03:11:04 Ather Jammoa nods.

03:11:09 Melinda Michaels says, "So yeah close enough."

03:11:13 Ather Jammoa says, "8-10 is mine, probably."

03:11:17 Vernos Bailey nods.

03:11:21 Aisling the Fox says, "Long cycle."

03:11:22 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I got it right at 4.36, but yeah probably off from when I turned earlier, sorry about that."

03:11:27 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:11:30 Morris Corlew says, "Depends. I wanna see our speeds once we start headin up."

03:11:32 Melinda Michaels says, "If we say 9 days, somebody could be waiting for us."

03:11:37 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:11:38 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:11:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Better to short end it."

03:11:50 Lily Kaise says, "Yup that would be a stretch."

03:11:51 Melinda says to Morris, "What, I am not kidding."

03:11:56 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

03:11:57 Ather Jammoa asks, "Na. Cause what if we get massively invaded in a week, and there aer only cadets to handle it?"

03:11:57 Morris says to Melinda, "They would?"

03:12:03 Ather Jammoa says, "We'd be done for."

03:12:05 Morris Corlew shakes his head.

03:12:08 Melinda says to Morris, "Do you think that QE is secure?"

03:12:19 Morris says to Melinda, "Nah. But 9 days is still a guess."

03:12:21 Eli Grey dashes in from the south.

03:12:28 Melinda says to Morris, "You are missing the point."

03:12:30 Morris says to Melinda, "And it's not at all secure. Goes out over general."

03:12:34 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

03:12:36 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "The QE sends the transmition ove rgen comms. It's probably one of the least secure methoda of communication!"

03:12:36 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:12:37 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:12:38 Lily Kaise nods.

03:12:58 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:13:02 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:13:02 Melinda Michaels says, "It took us 8 days to get out here, so who cares if it's a day off."

03:13:03 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:13:08 Eli Grey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:13:15 Morris Corlew says, "No matter what we send at this point, it's a guess. If we get there in one week exactly, by chance, somebody still could be waitin on us."

03:13:19 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

03:13:22 Melinda says to Morris, "Oy."

03:13:31 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:13:41 Ather Jammoa says, "I'd rather get there before our projected ETA so we can be like "surprise, fuckers.""

03:13:46 Morris Corlew grins at Ather Jammoa.

03:13:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Quit over-annalizing everything."

03:13:50 Eli Grey chuckles.

03:14:19 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:14:20 Lily Kaise says, "Yup we're going to have to call him Moreets from now on."

03:14:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:14:27 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:14:52 Melinda Michaels smiles at Lily Kaise.

03:14:57 Lily Kaise grins at Melinda Michaels.

03:15:00 Melinda Michaels examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

03:15:01 Melinda Michaels helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:15:08 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:15:16 Aisling the Fox carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Thor from her shoulder.

03:15:17 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:15:17 Aisling the Fox puts down a Tardick lizard named Thor.

03:15:18 Melinda Michaels says, "We have 9.731 days to drink this."

03:15:18 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:15:22 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:15:24 Lily Kaise says, "Yay."

03:15:27 Ather Jammoa examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

03:15:27 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:15:33 Aisling the Fox strokes a Tardick lizard named Thor's warm scaly skin.

03:15:33 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Ather Jammoa removes a small round personal three-meat pizza from the open compartment.

03:15:40 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:15:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Whose oven is this."

03:15:50 Aisling says to a Tardick lizard named Thor, "Sleep."

03:15:51 Morris says to Ather, "Mine."

03:16:10 Ather says to Morris, "I will give you 3 golden tael for...well no, it has some disgusting-looking options."

03:16:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:16:16 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Never mind!"

03:16:18 Morris Corlew sighs at Ather Jammoa.

03:16:24 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:16:24 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

03:16:25 Morris says to Ather, "Get your own."

03:16:26 Aisling says to Ather, "I will take 50 golden tael."

03:16:35 Ather Jammoa asks, "Well I mean, what the fuck is a kitchen sink pizza?"

03:16:43 Ather Jammoa says, "And pizza should not have vegetables on it cause eww."

03:16:46 Lily Kaise opens a purple silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered mystic purple cats.

03:16:49 Morris says to Ather, "Like...an everything pizza."

03:16:52 Morris Corlew examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

03:16:54 Melinda Michaels examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

03:16:54 Eli Grey says, "It's everything but the kitchen sink."

After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Morris Corlew removes a small round personal kitchen sink pizza from the open compartment.

03:16:59 Morris Corlew shows a small round personal kitchen sink pizza to Ather Jammoa.

03:17:00 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:17:01 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:17:05 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange.

After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Melinda Michaels removes a small round personal three-meat pizza from the open compartment.

03:17:08 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal kitchen sink pizza.

03:17:09 Lily Kaise removes a pile of fifty golden tael from a purple silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered mystic purple cats.

03:17:16 Lily Kaise pats a pile of fifty golden tael lightly.

03:17:17 Eli Grey blinks heavily and then dozes off.

03:17:20 Morris Corlew says, "Holy crap."

03:17:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh tha tlooks disgusting."

03:17:23 Lily Kaise puts a pile of fifty golden tael in a purple silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered mystic purple cats.

03:17:25 Ather Jammoa shudders.

03:17:26 Aisling says to Lily, "Just do not show that around."

03:17:28 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:17:29 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:17:30 Morris Corlew sighs at Ather Jammoa.

03:17:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:17:33 Melinda says to Morris, "What's in that?"

03:17:35 Aisling the Fox says, "Or you will get marked by little child."

03:17:38 Morris says to Melinda, "In what?"

03:17:42 Vernos Bailey says, "L quan."

03:17:42 Aisling the Fox says, "Claiming to have parts for your ship."

03:17:43 Morris says to Melinda, "The pizza?"

03:17:46 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I am likely marked for life."

03:17:49 Melinda says to Morris, "On that pizza."

03:17:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Or by Granny Tang."

03:17:53 Lily Kaise closes a purple silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered mystic purple cats.

03:17:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Looks like cheese, sausage, mushrooms, peppers..."

03:17:55 Aisling the Fox points at Ather Jammoa.

03:17:56 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:18:06 Melinda Michaels says, "I hate mushrooms."

03:18:10 Morris Corlew says, "Sausage, pepperoni, beef, mushrooms, onions, peppers, olives."

03:18:12 Lily Kaise says, "I loves them."

03:18:14 Ather says to Aisling, "Na, she mistook me for someone else. I know better to flaunt stuff in front of unregs."

03:18:22 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:18:23 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:18:24 Aisling the Fox says, "She knew who you were."

03:18:25 Melinda Michaels takes a bite of a small round personal three-meat pizza.

03:18:26 Ather Jammoa says, "Heck, I acted so like an unreg that she mistook me for a fucking unreg."

03:18:37 Ather says to Aisling, "Not the first time she didn't."

03:18:45 Aisling the Fox says, "This time she did."

03:18:51 Lily Kaise says, "Besides, they've seen me do a bunch of trading around out there. It's been awhile but yeah."

03:18:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Well yeah I mean after like 4 times she damn well better."

03:18:56 Aisling the Fox says, "Getting information about Franklin."

03:19:05 Aisling the Fox says, "That is what I am referring to."

03:19:17 Aisling the Fox says, "She milked you like cow for tael."

03:19:29 Ather Jammoa says, "I wasn't there for that ooh, Lily."

03:19:31 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:19:32 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:19:33 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:19:42 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:19:43 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:19:43 The stage lights flicker briefly.

03:19:48 Morris Corlew says, "We're givin an awful bad performance here folks."

03:19:54 Melinda says to Ather, "Do you know what group wears hoods out there?"

03:20:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Qi clan wore the hooded robes."

03:20:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Pretty sure it was them."

03:20:11 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

03:20:27 Melinda Michaels says, "They were the ones trying to find out where James was."

03:20:34 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:20:35 Melinda Michaels says, "Offered us tael."

03:20:40 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:20:43 Ather Jammoa arches an eyebrow.

03:20:45 Ather Jammoa asks, "When?"

03:20:46 Aisling the Fox says, "Interesting."

03:20:48 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:20:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Long time ago, when he was out that way."

03:20:53 Aisling the Fox asks, "James was mixed up with Qi Clan?"

03:20:55 Lily Kaise nods.

03:20:57 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

03:20:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh."

03:21:03 Lily Kaise says, "We averted our attention to them."

03:21:04 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:21:12 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:21:18 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

03:21:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Almost sent."

03:21:20 Ather says to Aisling, "Well, I imagine that he was looking for ways of hooking up with Amarantos. Who knows wha tdeals he made and with who."

03:21:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, after they left we made everybody get on the ship and Reets got mad at us."

03:21:30 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:21:33 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:21:35 Aisling says to Ather, "Give me 50 tael."

03:21:43 Ather Jammoa says, "Qi are a bunch of fucking nutjobs though."

03:21:44 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

03:21:46 Melinda Michaels nods to Ather Jammoa. "He was but I wasn't giving info, because you never know."

03:21:59 Lily Kaise says, "So I got referred to as a."

03:22:09 Ather Jammoa says, "I wouldn't deal with them if I could help it, though there was the film, that we got from them, if memory serves."

03:22:15 Melinda Michaels nods to Ather Jammoa.

03:22:25 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:22:43 Melinda Michaels says, "But Reets had a fit when we told him to get out of there. We didn't want the new pilots he had to possibly fuck things up for James."

03:22:49 Lily Kaise, Friend but not an Ally says, "We just went to the bar to have a couple of brews and meat dogs and it was pretty strange."

03:23:03 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, Andy's."

03:23:05 Lily Kaise nods.

03:23:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, they do seem to make most of their approaches at the bar on Andy's."

03:23:18 Melinda Michaels nods.

03:23:35 Lily Kaise says, "We just avoided any direct interaction and got up and left."

03:23:46 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:23:51 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:23:52 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:24:03 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:24:04 The stage lights flicker briefly.

03:24:11 Morris Corlew says, "Kim was tellin me about some of that. I was gonna go grab some salvage to sell at that nearby pre-stellar, but since she was sleepin, didn't want me to Leave Sarah there by herself."

03:24:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah Qi are a bit hardcore."

03:24:24 "We had a couple of cadets and some newly licensed pilots with us." Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "So, we rushed them out of there."

03:24:30 Ather Jammoa says, "They jumped us once."

03:24:36 Ather Jammoa says, "We ended up taking out all four ships."

03:24:42 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:25:07 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly, indicating that it has finished sending a message.

03:25:08 Morris says to Ather, "In the sector, or they pull ya from the rift?"

03:25:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, they pulled us."

03:25:22 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:25:39 Ather Jammoa says, "So we engaged. You don't want to show no weakness in those kinds of areas. So we pretty much just took em out."

03:25:39 Melinda says to Ather, "Is that when they thought they were going to board?"

03:25:55 Ather Jammoa nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:26:09 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:26:10 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

03:26:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Idiots. Like we'd willingly let them board the ship, kill our crew and take everything."

03:26:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

03:26:28 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:26:29 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:26:38 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal kitchen sink pizza.

03:27:27 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

03:28:29 Ather bites a piece off of the crust of a small round personal three-meat pizza, chews for a moment and gives a slight shrug. After swallowing he says, "we pretty much showed no mercy anytime we were in Unreg space. Heck, when we had altercations with the Chevalier clan, we pretty much did our best to take them out too. They're dman good pilots though. Very skilled."

03:28:42 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:28:43 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:28:56 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:28:57 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:29:21 Ather Jammoa says, "Haven't managed to destroy any of their ships that I can recall. They always manage to jump out."

03:29:24 Lily Kaise says, "They interdict so yeah."

03:29:29 Morris glances down at his pizza.

03:31:14 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:31:27 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly east.

03:31:40 Vernos Bailey says, "They back home like oh fuck they are coming back."

03:31:49 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

03:31:51 Eli Grey dashes east.

03:32:12 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

03:32:22 Eli Grey dashes in from the east.

03:32:24 Rogue Romano says, "Prob most of them thinks that."

03:32:25 Eli Grey examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

03:32:28 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal kitchen sink pizza.

03:32:34 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of hot green tea.

03:32:38 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

03:32:40 Eli Grey retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into his mouth.

03:33:08 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe I'll go back out again right away and get rid of the cargo on invocation at Andy's."

03:33:32 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:33:33 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

03:33:52 Aisling says to Ather, "No."

03:33:54 Eli Grey tries to keep his tea and ramen covered.

03:33:59 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of hot green tea.

03:34:00 Ather says to Aisling, "Your no is irrelevant."

03:34:03 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:34:05 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:34:05 Aisling the Fox says, "No it is not."

03:34:07 Morris Corlew finishes off a small round personal kitchen sink pizza.

03:34:28 Ather Jammoa asks, "Ok fine, your no is irrelevant when it comes to any decision I need to make about my next destination?"

03:34:32 Ather Jammoa grins.

03:34:36 Rogue Romano smirks.

03:34:37 Aisling the Fox says, "No."

03:34:49 Ather Jammoa pats Aisling the Fox on the back. "Sure sure."

03:35:11 Aisling the Fox asks, "You want to possibly get left behind and not go on trip out to find my home ship?"

03:35:19 Aisling the Fox says, "Then go to Andy's for trade run."

03:35:21 Ather Jammoa asks, "What, you're going to leave right away?"

03:35:26 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Andy's is a day trip!"

03:35:33 Aisling the Fox says, "Have fun."

03:35:52 Eli Grey asks, "So... since this storm just came out of nowhere, and we never really got to see it with the sensors, how do we know we're not getting teleported all over the place in a strange storm?"

03:36:02 Morris Corlew says, "We don't."

03:36:04 Eli Grey takes a bite of a serving of hot pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

03:36:04 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:36:05 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

03:36:06 Ather Jammoa says, "Cause there are no discharge pulses."

03:36:07 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:36:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Strange storms have discharge pulses."

03:36:19 Aisling the Fox says, "If I get back and do not have any information from Council or Agnarr then yes."

03:36:21 Morris says to Ather, "That's not necessarily true."

03:36:27 Eli glances at Ather and nods thoughtfully.

03:36:36 Ather Jammoa says, "Every strange storm I ever been in has had discharge pulses."

03:36:38 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not think I will be waiting much longer."

03:36:47 Ather Jammoa nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:36:47 Morris says to Ather, "The one on Mel's trip, we were halfway into it and had been teleported four times at least before we started getting discharges."

03:36:55 Melinda Michaels nods.

03:36:57 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

03:36:59 Ather says to Aisling, "Well, I can delay a bit. It's minimal cargo."

03:37:02 Melinda Michaels says, "But we eventually did get them."

03:37:05 Morris Corlew nods.

03:37:09 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

03:37:13 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Oh, yes, the charges sometimes take like 5 minutes to happen, but they do happen!"

03:37:21 Morris says to Ather, "Nah, this took almost an hour."

03:37:28 Ather Jammoa says, "The piont is, if it was a strange storm, we'd more than likely have seen energy pulses by now."

03:37:29 Aisling says to Ather, "We can go at some point together and dock it in Oracle."

03:37:32 Morris says to Ather, "And by that time we'd already gone almost 200 light-years."

03:37:32 Eli Grey says, "That almost sounds like an indicator of an actual teleport."

03:37:35 Aisling the Fox says, "I need to trade anyway."

03:37:37 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

03:37:57 Eli Grey takes several bites of a serving of hot pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.

03:38:01 Ather says to Eli, "It's not, we tested that too."

03:38:04 Morris Corlew says, "We started getting discharges not too long before it started sending us back the way we'd come."

03:38:06 Aisling the Fox says, "Teleport indicator is drop in riftflow speed."

03:38:06 Ather says to Aisling, "Sure."

03:38:10 Aisling the Fox says, "But there are discharges."

03:38:14 Morris says to Aisling, "That wasn't true of that storm either."

03:38:21 Morris says to Aisling, "Flow stayed steady."

03:38:28 Morris Corlew says, "So did direction."

03:38:33 Morris Corlew says, "Only thing changed was the NDB."

03:38:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Then it was probably teleporting you around tha tparticular region. Regions are big."

03:38:58 Morris says to Ather, "2 to 8 points on the NDB at a time."

03:39:04 Ather Jammoa chortles.

03:39:06 Ather Jammoa says, "That's actually not bad."

03:39:11 Ather Jammoa says, "I've had a drop of 20."

03:39:19 Ather says to Aisling, "Remember?"

03:39:22 Morris says to Ather, "Going backwards, we had uh..."

03:39:22 Aisling the Fox nods to Ather Jammoa.

03:39:23 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:39:32 Ather Jammoa says, "We had to redo an entire day's LTC once."

03:39:44 Aisling the Fox says, "We did."

03:39:47 Ather Jammoa says, "It dropped us like 5 lTC's with one teleport."

03:39:53 Ather Jammoa says, "If not more."

03:39:58 Morris Corlew says, "Well we went from somethin like 58 to 28 before it started pushin us back. Think it took two teleports before the storm dissipated and we were displaced 100 light-years further back."

03:39:58 Ather Jammoa says, "I think we went from 37 to 17."

03:40:23 Ather says to Morris, "Na, that all happened with a single jolt."

03:40:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Then we were like fuck this."

03:40:32 Morris Corlew says, "Anyway, point is, we could technically be bein teleported. No discharges or changes in speed required."

03:40:39 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:40:40 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:41:04 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:41:05 Ather Jammoa says, "We've been in this storm for so long that I'm pretty sure if it was a strange storm we'd have seen discharges by now."

03:41:05 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:41:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, it's one of those weird ones."

03:41:27 "Dunno." Morris Corlew shrugs. "Like I said, that one took an hour nearly before the first discharge."

03:41:28 Ather Jammoa says, "The one where you speed up for like 3 seconds then slow down."

03:41:35 Ather Jammoa says, "I forget what they're called."

03:41:35 Eli says to Aisling, "So this old style jumpship, it's a pre-subjugation vessel right?"

03:41:40 Morris Corlew says, "A lotta teleportin had been goin on by then. And that'st the way that one was too."

03:41:48 Aisling the Fox nods to Eli Grey.

03:41:55 Morris says to Ather, "We've had a bunch of mixed-type storms lately."

03:42:00 Ather says to Eli, "It's pretty much an upgraded antique."

03:42:06 Aisling the Fox says, "The Jumpship is modeled after first ship to make FTL jump."

03:42:14 Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:42:39 Ather says to Morris, "Well, I imagine storms murge together like two parents and make ultra intelligent babystorm. Kinda like how my parents made an ultraintelligent baby."

03:42:58 Morris Corlew looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully and chuckles. "If you say so."

03:42:58 Eli Grey asks, "Out of curiosity, have you tried to possibly find someone who could modify our current parts to at least be some kind of temporary fix?"

03:42:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Then they had me."

03:42:58 Vernos Bailey says, "He said it, not me."

03:43:03 Ather Jammoa says, "And well, the baby disappeared."

03:43:06 Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:43:20 Morris says to Ather, "You eat it?"

03:43:27 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out.

03:43:30 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:43:30 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

03:43:34 Ather Jammoa says, "That's the stupidest thing I ever heard."

03:43:37 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:43:38 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

03:43:41 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:43:42 Morris Corlew grins at Ather Jammoa.

03:43:42 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:44:00 Morris says to Ather, "Not like the original statement was scientific fact or nothin."

03:44:03 Vernos Bailey says, "He fed it to a sanitation drone."

03:44:07 Aisling says to Eli, "That was my hope with Agnarr, but prior to leaving I had not heard back from him."

03:44:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Vernos' assessment is more spot on."

03:44:14 Morris says to Vernos, "I was thinkin maybe a lizard."

03:44:25 Aisling the Fox says, "If I get back and still have heard nothing, then best best is to just go out at this point."

03:44:30 Ather says to Aisling, "Send another notice telling him to check his mail."

03:44:51 Aisling the Fox says, "Already did. Liaison was not happy about being glorified mail man."

03:44:53 Ather says to Aisling, "They won't use a temp station even for a bit?"

03:45:16 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know if temp station will repair that kind of damage."

03:45:18 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:45:25 Eli says to Aisling, "What about Fienstein?"

03:45:32 Aisling the Fox says, "I have not asked."

03:45:37 Ather Jammoa says, "We could plop one down with a fusion battery. Let them dock the ship. That way they can do some external repairs without worrying about vacuum."

03:45:50 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:45:51 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

03:45:55 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

03:45:57 Ather says to Aisling, "Even if it can't repair what they need repaired."

03:46:05 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:46:06 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:46:07 Ather Jammoa says, "They can use it to conduct their own repairs."

03:46:08 Aisling the Fox says, "I am not sure if a temporary station could hold the ship. It is large."

03:46:14 Ather Jammoa nods.

03:46:37 Vernos Bailey says, "What they need is a tempoary drydock station."

03:46:40 Aisling the Fox says, "It may originally have been a Jumpship, but it does not look anything like that anymore."

03:47:26 Ather says to Aisling, "I mean, at this point we can go, but then what would we do?"

03:47:36 Aisling the Fox says, "Take supplies."

03:47:42 Aisling the Fox says, "Make sure they are even still alive."

03:47:45 Ather Jammoa says, "That would definitely be good."

03:47:59 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I have grand supplies on bolt!"

03:48:04 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Medical ones!"

03:48:09 Ather Jammoa says, "And food, and water, and air."

03:48:14 Aisling the Fox says, "Confirm location to make trip back out easier."

03:48:24 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:48:27 Ather says to Aisling, "Well, you still have the chart, right?"

03:48:35 Aisling the Fox says, "It is a small area."

03:48:52 Ather says to Aisling, "Where'd you pop in when you got here?"

03:48:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, when you got there."

03:48:59 Aisling the Fox says, "I am not exactly sure where that area is. I jumped all over the place to get here."

03:49:02 Ather Jammoa says, "When you got to alliance/Mutuality space."

03:49:04 Aisling the Fox says, "Helios."

03:49:15 Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:49:23 Ather Jammoa asks, "From coreward, eh?"

03:49:27 Aisling the Fox says, "I was given that general location to find Helios."

03:49:28 Aisling the Fox nods.

03:49:37 Aisling the Fox says, "Found a station which was a protectorate."

03:49:38 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:49:39 Ather Jammoa removes a gold slipcloth from a midnight blue backpack for a moment.

03:49:39 Ather Jammoa removes a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs from a gold slipcloth.
You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:49:52 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:49:53 The stage lights flicker briefly.

03:49:57 Ather mutters something as he hunches over his tablet, making calculations.

03:50:06 Ather Jammoa looks over a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs, locating a pinned position.

03:50:17 Ather Jammoa traces his finger between two points on a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs.

03:50:29 Ather hmms.

03:50:33 Aisling the Fox says, "Let me see."

03:50:38 Aisling the Fox puts a space imaging photograph of five stars in very close proximity in a worn and tattered brown leather satchel.

03:50:49 Ather Jammoa looks over a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs, locating a pinned position.

03:50:51 Ather Jammoa says, "Hang on a sec."

03:50:57 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

03:51:00 Ather Jammoa traces his finger between two points on a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs.

03:51:10 Ather Jammoa nods.

03:51:14 Ather Jammoa gives a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs to Aisling the Fox.

03:51:30 Aisling the Fox traces her finger between two points on a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs.

03:51:34 Ather says to Aisling, "I think Aside from farport, Helios is pretty much the more coreward of the stations. Farport is more antispinward."

03:51:49 Ather Jammoa says, "So, might make sense."

03:51:57 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly west.

03:52:06 Aisling the Fox removes a dark brown leather binder with an antique brass swingarm latch from a worn and tattered brown leather satchel.

03:52:09 Aisling the Fox opens a dark brown leather binder with an antique brass swingarm latch.

03:52:16 Eli Grey retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of the bowl and slurps them up.

03:52:20 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of hot green tea.

03:52:26 Ather says to Aisling, "Oh, let me see that tablet for a sec."

03:52:32 Ather Jammoa says, "I wonder."

03:52:33 Aisling the Fox gives a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs to Ather Jammoa.

03:52:38 Ather Jammoa looks over a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs, locating a pinned position.

03:52:48 Ather Jammoa traces his finger between two points on a clear plastic tablet dotted with points of color and bordered in swirling gold designs.

03:53:00 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, it's Helios."

03:53:03 Aisling the Fox says, "My chart is larger."

03:53:13 Eli Grey says, "Oh great here we go.."

03:53:21 Aisling the Fox says, "Only by a little."

03:53:30 Eli Grey asks, "Now is time for a chart size competition?"

03:53:31 Aisling the Fox says, "But it does not cover enough space probably."

03:53:33 Eli Grey laughs.

03:53:37 Ather says to Aisling, "Your chart has a different central location, too."

03:53:43 Aisling the Fox pokes and prods at a sheaf of thin cartographical printouts covered with arcane handwritten notes and labeled "Down Of Farport".

03:53:54 Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins dizzyingly.

03:53:55 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

03:54:00 Ather says to Aisling, "How many lightyears?"

03:54:03 Aisling the Fox looks over a sheaf of thin cartographical printouts covered with arcane handwritten notes and labeled "Down Of Farport", locating a pinned position.

03:54:07 The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few moments.

03:54:08 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:54:11 Aisling the Fox says, "325.15."

03:54:20 Aisling the Fox says, "Compared to 311 about on yours."

03:54:28 Ather Jammoa nods.

03:54:30 Aisling the Fox traces her finger between two points on a sheaf of thin cartographical printouts covered with arcane handwritten notes and labeled "Down Of Farport".

03:54:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, about 2 LTC's larger."

03:54:42 Aisling the Fox says, "Farport is far away though from Helios."

03:54:43 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:54:48 Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:54:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, assuming you buy the right batteries next time, I will help you set up another array."

03:54:54 Aisling the Fox says, "Hum."

03:55:10 Ather says to Aisling, "Helios is within the range of that chart, I'm sure."

03:55:13 Eli Grey says, "I never realized until I was jumping around The Cross randomly checking the Torus NDB."

03:55:15 Aisling the Fox says, "Assuming you tell me to buy right batteries, okay."

03:55:27 Ather Jammoa says, "Like I have to tell you -everything-."

03:55:39 Aisling the Fox says, "You told me what to buy and I bought it. You told me wrong thing."

03:55:43 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I did not!"

03:55:45 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I said fision!"

03:55:47 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Not fusion!"

03:55:47 Aisling the Fox says, "You did."

03:55:55 Ather Jammoa says, "There is a difference between fision and fusion."

03:55:58 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Fision!"

03:55:59 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Fusion!"

03:56:12 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Fi-fu-fi-fu!"

03:56:14 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

03:56:15 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:56:17 Morris Corlew sighs.

03:56:41 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

03:56:41 Ather Jammoa strides south.

03:56:41 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:56:43 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:57:08 Eli Grey exclaims, "Me!"

03:57:12 Morris Corlew says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

03:57:16 You say, "Me myself and I."

03:57:19 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Goin out."

03:57:20 Morris Corlew presses a large button marked CYCLE.

03:57:22 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

03:57:24 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

03:57:29 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

03:57:30 Morris Corlew carefully opens the hatch and floats outside, into deep space.

03:57:31 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

04:01:06 Ather Jammoa presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

04:01:10 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:01:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:01:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:01:13 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

04:01:14 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:56:34 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

04:56:34 A dwarf star is here, a point of light with an apparent size not much bigger than far more distant stars. Only its greater brightness indicates its proximity.

04:57:48 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed on the chest and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labele

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

05:38:50 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

05:42:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:42:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:42:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:42:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:52:48 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:52:58 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:52:58 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:53:02 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

05:53:03 The starship has left a unique area of space.

05:53:09 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

07:58:24 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

07:58:34 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

08:28:26 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

08:38:32 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

09:41:15 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

09:41:23 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

09:41:23 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

09:43:00 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is Ather still up by any chance?"

09:43:13 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "This thing's greater than Sol equivalent."

10:17:23 The starship has left a unique area of space.

10:17:29 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

10:17:48 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

10:19:43 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Bob."

10:20:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Mister Frenchname."

10:20:09 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sleep good, Pierre."

10:34:45 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

10:47:20 A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.

10:49:51 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

11:00:08 Several snowglobes stacked vertically hover past at high speed.

11:10:22 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

11:20:02 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

11:20:12 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

11:23:39 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

11:25:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

11:26:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:27:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

11:50:04 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

12:00:11 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

12:10:35 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

12:15:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

12:15:51 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

12:21:16 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

12:22:14 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

12:22:24 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

12:27:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

12:29:24 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

12:31:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

12:52:15 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

13:02:28 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

13:12:41 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

13:22:53 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

13:23:08 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

13:23:17 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

13:41:32 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

13:50:41 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shipwreck field."

13:50:49 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

13:50:50 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

13:51:05 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

13:55:54 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:01:16 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

14:01:37 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aquarium fish."

14:04:08 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I whisper my regrets to all."

14:09:51 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:10:08 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:10:18 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

14:10:41 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:11:42 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

14:13:01 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:14:04 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

14:15:58 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:16:14 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

14:16:17 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

14:16:29 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

14:16:30 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

14:16:37 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

14:17:27 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

14:17:37 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

14:17:37 Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:18:05 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alas. We could probably find some pretty unique artifacts here."

14:18:19 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup."

14:27:21 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

14:27:52 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Interesting, this one was previously discovered."

14:27:58 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But no image."

14:28:44 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "At any rate, Nicolette's name is in the library. So is mine but I don't remember being down here."

14:29:15 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Could the shipwrecks have jumped down here from where they originally were?"

14:29:25 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Na, I may know where this came from."

14:29:40 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The detour on the Dolia trip."

14:29:48 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But wow, was it this far out?"

14:29:55 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Cool!"

14:33:29 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:33:39 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:33:39 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

14:33:40 The starship has left a unique area of space.

14:33:49 Listen. You need to be careful.

14:38:08 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

14:39:07 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

14:50:07 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

14:56:07 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins folds his legs inward and goes very still.

15:03:40 You're really alone here. So very alone.

15:13:49 They stare at you. Of course they do.

15:24:11 So much pain. For what?

15:34:23 They're just using you.

15:34:52 Remember what I said.

15:35:02 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

16:04:53 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

16:15:25 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

16:25:44 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

16:36:02 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

16:37:41 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

16:37:51 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

17:07:43 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

17:18:02 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

17:28:13 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

17:31:14 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

17:40:12 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

17:40:22 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

17:54:10 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

18:05:40 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

18:10:14 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

18:13:40 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

18:20:45 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

18:31:10 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

18:41:31 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

18:41:59 The curtains close, to no applause.

18:42:09 Listen. You need to be careful.

18:47:07 It's not always about where you're going.

18:47:07 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

18:48:07 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

18:49:12 It's not always about where you're going.

18:49:12 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

18:53:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're not headed for a storm are we?"

18:53:36 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Neutron star."

18:53:49 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ah, turning. Awesome!"

18:57:42 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins stirs and slowly unfolds his eight hairy legs.

18:59:13 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters east.

18:59:54 It's not always about where you're going.

18:59:55 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

19:00:31 It's not always about where you're going.

19:04:52 It's not always about where you're going.

19:05:04 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

19:05:04 A tiny, bright sphere floats in space here; a neutron star, the corpse of a once-massive star. It is a perfect sphere, unlike most stars, and only a few kilometers across. It is not very hot, and according to its sensor profile, radiates mostly in ultraviolet and X-rays.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:05:39 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Proooobe."

19:06:09 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

19:06:30 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probe the probe probing the probe."

19:24:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:24:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:24:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:24:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:25:02 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow, a planet?"

19:25:07 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Indeed."

19:25:13 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

19:25:17 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It is being torn apart."

19:36:56 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

19:42:40 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are we doing a probe on planet?"

19:42:47 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

21:25:39 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo!"

21:26:13 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Now just waiting ont he system probe to complete."

21:26:25 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gotcha."

21:26:35 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

21:26:35 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

21:28:31 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That should be soon I hope."

21:35:27 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

21:38:21 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

22:07:00 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:07:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:07:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:07:14 The starship has left a unique area of space.

22:07:20 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

22:37:11 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

22:45:05 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

22:55:24 A shoal of silver scaled fished, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

23:06:00 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

23:10:18 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

23:10:28 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

23:16:59 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

23:40:19 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

23:50:31 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

23:51:36 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.
