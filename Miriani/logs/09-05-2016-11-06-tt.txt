Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

rift heading
Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life
and coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, an engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst
butterflies, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a red nylon
mesh shopping bag, an insulated green cooler, and Magellan the arachnoid
security robot here.
Kim Saunders and Lily Kaise are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white

A medium-sized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a

flag.
-desiree Alright, take us in.
You say to Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, "Alright, take us
in."
Kim Saunders giggles.

rift stop
You press a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins
dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

This location is not connected to the FTL beacon network.
There are no temporary beacons in range.
'ugh, come on!
You exclaim, "Ugh, come on!"
rift start
You flip a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then
push a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

Star Conquest Help: Alliance Governments
--
Category: Background
--
The alliances may consist of only humans, but their systems of government differ
considerably.
THE LEAGUE OF OLD EARTH DEMOCRACIES
In many ways, the League government is a progression of the United States
Government of today.
At its head, the League possesses a President, voted for by the general
population in elections once every five years.  Term limits do not apply, (as
opposed to today in the USA) so a president could theoretically continue to run
indefinitely.  The President is the Presidential Candidate that gains the
majority of the votes in the election.
There is also the League Congress, split into the House of Representatives, a
collection of senators elected from each world of the League the number of each
depending on the population of the planet or moon, and the Senate; where two
senators represent each world.
The 300 senators from the House of Representatives are currently split in the
following fashion:
* Old Earth: 100 senators.
* Mars: 62 senators.
* Luna: 50 senators.
* Centauri: 43 senators. 
* Vesta: 30 senators.
* Callisto: 15 senators.
While in theory this is a democratic system, where the President must pass
everything before the two houses of Congress, bribery and corruption are common.
 Whips are employed regularly, with spin being one of the major efforts when
attempting to pass new legislation and get things done, rather than fact or
voter wishes.
The current President of the League is Johan Dietrich of the Conservatives
Party.  He has been President since 2314, when then-President Charisse Robinson
stepped down. Robinson had been President since 2285, having previously won four
elections and postponed a fifth due to the Outsider subjugation of humanity. 
Robinson is now working with the Accord of Free Worlds.
The population of League space is approximately 60 billion.
The capital world is Old Earth, housing the seat of League government in the
city of Brussels.
--
THE ALLIANCE OF EXTRASOLAR UNIONS
While similar to the League, the AEU governing body is slightly different.
The top-most level of control still resides with the President, and elections
also take place once every five years.  But the general population vote for the
party and individual representatives, with the President as the leader of the
winning party, having been elected as a minister in his or her own region.
The President is still the figurehead of the government, but more power resides
within the Cabinet, the council of ministers appointed to various roles within
government that collectively decide policy and direction.
There are also two Houses, split between elected ministers from New Earth in one
house, respected authorities from Hyperion, Telex, Bikura, Endymion and Aenea in
the other.  These houses have veto powers over legislation, with the latter also
having the ability to call for a vote of no confidence, forcing an election when
general faith in the current party has been lost.
Each world is split into several regions based on continents, voting in their
own representative minister to give them a voice.  Each planet appoints one of
their ministers to represent them in the alliance Cabinet.  These are usually,
but not always, the chosen Chancellor or primary minister of each world.
The Cabinet: 6 ministers.
* New Earth: 25 regions.
* Hyperion: 20 regions.
* Telex: 16 regions.
* Bikura: 13 regions.
* Endymion: 10 regions.
* Aenea: 8 regions.
While there is still corruption within some levels of the AEU government, checks
are in place to attempt to excise it.
The current President of the AEU is Warren Garner of the Green Earth Party, who
took office in 2310 after then-President Christopher Sheffield of the New
Republic Party (along with the majority of government) was arrested by a joint
task force of EAOS and AEU security after attempts were made to surrender to the
Outsiders, culminating in Enforcer drones on New Earth and the threat of
destruction for other alliances.  The National Patriots Party (led by Aaron
Richmond) were the official Opposition Party, but during the Resistance offered
a Coalition with the Green Earth Party to ensure a unified government. 
Sheffield had been President since 2290, having won three elections and
postponing a fourth due to the Outsider subjugation of humanity.
The population of AEU space is approximately 45 billion.
The capital world is New Earth, with the seat of AEU government being housed in
the city of Velouria.

THE CONFEDERATION OF FRINGE WORLDS
Once, the Fringe government was a parliamentary republic, with the President and
Prime Minister sharing power; the President being the head of state while the
Prime Minister being head of government.
The last individuals to hold these roles were President Robin Domon and Prime
Minister Courtney Brown.
However, in 2292 a brief but powerful coup forced them from power and their
current whereabouts are unknown.  
Today, the Fringe government is a Military Dictatorship headed by one Space
Chief Marshal Nina Thomas.
No reason has ever been given for the coup, but many believe that Space Marshal
Thomas (along with large portions of the military) considered the President and
Prime Minister to be corrupt and abusing their position, keeping many worlds of
the Fringe barely habitable while also cracking down on any attempt to gain
necessary food or equipment through less-than-legal means.
While evidence for this is less than easy to come by, it is clear that even with
a limited form of martial law in effect, under her current government the Fringe
has flourished in a way that as a republic it did not.
Indeed, today the average citizens of the Fringe worlds seem to adore their
Commander-in-Chief, as she takes a far more hands-on approach than President
Domon, PM Brown or the leaders of the other alliances ever have.
During the Outsider subjugation of humanity, it was Space Marshal Thomas who
kept the Fringe spirit burning with firey speeches, leading by example and even
losing an arm to an Outsider enforcer drone when she refused to surrender in
person without further 'negative stimulus' - her becoming unconscious from the
shock and pain being taken as her 'surrender'.
The population of Fringe space is approximately 25 billion.
The capital world is Chetumal, with the seat of Fringe government technically
residing on Nina Thomas's battle barge, a huge hovering war machine constructed
after the coup.  However, during the Outsider assault and subjugation, the
battle barge was heavily damaged and was forced to land several miles outside
Chetumal City, where Space Chief Marshal Thomas made her final stand and faced
down the army of Enforcer drones herself, leading the remaining vestiges of the
Fringe insurrection. 
--
THE EGALITARIAN ALLIANCE OF SENTIENTS
Little is known about the inner workings of the EAOS' government body, but it is
clear that they have some kind of power sharing system, as James Korie and
Thomas Haldeman appeared to share control before the Outsider Subjugation of
Mankind.  Never explicitly refered to as President, Premier or any other term,
it is not known what exactly their respective roles are. 
Since 2309, James Korie has been held by the Confederation of Fringe Worlds for
'Crimes Against Humanity', as many in the alliances believe him responsible for
the original Subjugation.
The population of EAOS space is believed to be approximately 65 million.
The capital station is The Torus.  It is unknown where any members of the EAOS
government meet.
--
THE SOVEREIGN MUTUALITY OF DISPARATE FREEMEN
Less a true singular alliance and more a collective of independent
nation-states, the Mutuality appears to have a government-by-committee.  Each
space station, along with many of the larger starships, seem to be controlled by
what almost amounts to their own micro-nations - each sending an individual to
become part of the Mutuality government as a whole.  How each individal
collective decides on their chosen representative or their leadership in general
is unknown. 
This does mean, however, that intra-alliance conflict is likely to be common.
While there is no full listing of individuals that posess a leadership role
available at the current time, some names have become known:
Aleksei Frolov - apparently a military commander
Renee Sauveterre - controller of space station Helios
Cassandra of Turanova - controller of space station Tandem
Brandon Ryland - controller of space station DeMargas
There are most likely others, but this will likely remain unclear - at least for
the forseeable future. What is clear is that there is no unified whole.
There are also communitees of unregistered pilots that have no premanent
residence.  It is unclear whether all, some, or none of these are a part of the
Mutuality as a whole - though we do know that not all unregistered pilots have
joined with the Mutuality or become a protectorate.
The population of Mutuality space is unknown, as borders fluctuate rapidly and
there is no official census.
The capital station is probably Helios, but this may be subject to change.  It
is suspected that the committee meets in the Conference Room located on that
station.

l lily
Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a plain white spacesuit helmet, a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit
with a cluster of stars printed on the chest, a plain white spacesuit top, a
pair of plain white spacesuit gloves, a plain white spacesuit bottom, and a pair
of plain white spacesuit boots. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. Her face and
both eyes are left uncovered.
She is carrying a Jinu hull plate in her right hand.

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I pretty much take back
anything bad I might have said about 285 for salvaging, with the exception that
unless you have a good grapple that'll do up to grade 60, it would be more
difficult."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Even with a grade 50, you'll
get some of the grade 60, just not all."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I said more
difficult, not impossible."

people can use locals and do the grade 20 and 30 until they are ready."

requirements for one of the fine-toothed grapples that'll do 60, but I do know

that thought, but I do see the point of it. If it wasn't for 134, I wouldn't be
where I am now. So for people like me, to get to where I am now, it is more
difficult."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ted, I just said I took back
what I said about 285 for salvaging and see the point about 134, though it

[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I thought you did highs last
night."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. Two very lows and a
standard."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or it might have been a low. I
don't recall now. But I completed a standard just now, though."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Oh thought you only got lock
ivasions on highs."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Apparently not."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Why would you only get lock
evasions on highs? Are you not avoiding locks with the others?"
tra gen Nah, you get lock evasions any time you avoid locks.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Nah, you get lock evasions
any time you avoid locks."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Strange then because I
didn't get any when I ran a couple of beacons in my vette."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "They were low."
tra gen That's because you were gunning too.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's because you were
gunning too."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You only get credit for one
thing. So if you gun, you don't get lock evasions."
tra gen If you're shooting, you don't get credit for evasions.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If you're shooting, you don't
get credit for evasions."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Aa."

then."

Stalwart is a nice stepping stone."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Bla."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm just glad it can take a
beating like it does."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I may have to turn general
off."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The Wing kills them faster
though, pros and cons."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Sad times eva."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I would rather my ship be
able to take a beating."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Not really, darling."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Who says the wing can't take a
bit of a beating."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Just because the AEU doesn't

[General Communication] Blake Madison snickers at Ted Warburton.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah well, I was getting hit
before I could get them tracked. So the stalwart really helped in that
department."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And until a Fringeling gifts
me a wing, it's a nonissue."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You fly and eng in a Wing."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Again, more to do at once. I
prefer the stalwart for learning to fly beacons."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My personal preference, and
what I have available to me in my alliacne."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I think it's a nice ship to
learn in, yes."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "I...don't think I've flown a
stalwart..."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Flying and enging. Acutally
sounds quite nice personally."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We have ships that'll do that
too. But I learn best doing one thing at a time and getting good at it before
combining them."

rats fighters were already in the sector. Not thinking this would hurt anything
and I could get the drills, I killed the rats fighters. But now the harvesters I
was sent here to kill are not showing up. What should I do? Have I messed up
this mission?"
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Have you left the sector and come
back?"
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "That mission changes from probes into
fighters, depending on your SCP."
[Newbie Help] Corey Matthews transmits, "I was told probes and minors. I did not
leave the sector and come back. Should I?"
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Give it a try."
[Newbie Help] Corey Matthews transmits, "Alright I will."
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "Yup. That'll reset the mission."
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "As far as I remember."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "If it doesn't, submit a ticket."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "There should be nothing in the sector
when you enter, so if there is, in future, go back out and come back later."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Greetings Johann,
I appreciate the report you sent me detailing the League's defence plan. There
are some very good points, but I also have some questions.
First of all, I like the idea of using the Torus as a staging point. It is the
most heavily armoured station and doesn't seem to be attacked often. The capital
planets as a second staging point also makes sense.
I do, however, have some questions. In the event of a large invasion, how many
ships and what class of ships do you envision as an ideal response? Also, if we
respond with more than one of the largest ships in the sector, e.g. two or more
cruisers, who has command of the fleet? 
In terms of actual combat, I think if we place too many limitations, we may
cause pilots to lose their concentration thereby risking ships and their crew.
Having fought in wasps launched from a morningstar, I know it can get cluttered.
However, if I have to consider that I can't move certain places because of the Z
axis I've been assigned, that extra  second could result in my ship
unnecessarily getting hit as well as limiting my options in terms of were I can
move. I do, however, think it is a good idea to pair big ships with small ships
and attack the same ship. For example, a gunship and a destroyer attacking the
same ship could be very useful and efficient. In fact, that destroyer could just
follow that same gunship around, attacking everything it does. Those are my
thoughts so far. I look forward to receiving your comments and thoughts as well.
Regards,
Shule

[Starship "Morris's Last Stand"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The one-person cargo hauler "Tony's Delivery Shuttle", the imperator "Someday We
Will Foresee Obstacles", the four-person mule "The Sheath", the three-person
stalwart "Morris's Last Stand", the two-person light corvette "League Navy
Assault Corvette Kestrel-78", and the two-person light corvette "League Navy
Assault Corvette Kestrel-33" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,

You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Letss than 330 to get my next
industry goal, less than 25 for my next SCP goal, exploration is still capped,
and ground is crappy as I don't know what."
Morris Corlew deftly presses a button on a "Morris's Last Stand" key.
Morris Corlew says into the external PA microphone, "come on in"

palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
Morris Corlew points at a textured plasteel bench.
Lily Kaise stands up.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Morris Corlew presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Morris's Last Stand. Welcome to Accord space."
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock
Four).

[Starship "Morris's Last Stand"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Dear Kim, Shule, and Angel,
Anfisa, Nissi, Liam, Morris, and myself have headed off aboard Metal Heart to
rendezvous with Yadira Rivera, Keegan's tactical exploration platform. We are
performing the rendezvous for reasons that are very important to Anfisa and
Nissi. We will need some help from you to make sure that both ships can find
each other. 
Using course information that Yadira Rivera sent through the QE comm, we have
set our course to 75 2 from Coreward Reach. Please set the Torus hypercaster to
that heading. Use power setting 70%. I have asked Sakura, Zandria, and any other
Business Cats who are available to help with our slot from the 2300 to 2359
period, so between your rental time and ours we can achieve a two hour block of
broadcast time.
Since both Metal Heart and Yadira Rivera have QE comms, it is possible for
people here at home to relay a message from one ship to the other, either by
repeating the message over the hypercaster relay channel during the rental
times, or by sending a QE message from Accord of Free Worlds command station to
the intended ship. Since we'll be searching a fairly large area for the
rendezvous, any help you can provide in helping the two ships maintain
communication is very much appreciated.
Sincerely,
-Akemi Bando

Shule. Regarding your first point, I would say there have been very few times
when two cruisers were able to fully crew in an invasion situation. That being
said, it has been done, and what I would propose is that whoever's space we're
in then has command. If, say, League and AEU go into Fringe space to clear it,
then the first crew on the sceen has command.
Regarding your comments on the Z-axis, these are meant as a general guide to
avoid unnecessary blockages of the path. It's not a hard and fast rule. If you
are blocked and need to go up or down, of course you should do so. Regarding
smaller ships, I would personally send them after other small ships until either
they cleaned them out or we came to help. Once smaller ships are gone, they can
of course come help out with what's left.
Those are just my thoughts on the matter, and as always in case of ifs, the
situation changes. Again, in that situation, the biggest ships should go in and
trade taking the brunt of the lrl attacks.
