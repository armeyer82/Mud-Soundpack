18:30 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 9, 7."

18:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Antares' Fire. We read your Commonwealth transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

18:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

18:30 ["Antares' Fire" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush red carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a long gold sofa with wide arms and deep cloth cushions, a black suede recliner with diamond chips on the arms, and a tall white gold sculpture of a puppy here.

18:31 [Alliance High Guard Command; Starship Store]
This lavishly decorated store is probably the brightest and cheeriest on the level. Helpful salesdroids roll about from place to place, greeting new customers as they enter and wishing them a good day as they leave. Large pedistals take up most of the available floorspace, each with a scale model starship perched atop. Embedded into each of the pedistals is a computer with information on the ship classes scrolling on it. Beneath each computer is a series of buttons, each clearly labeled as to their function. The button furthest to the left reads MENU, next to it is INFO, POINTS comes next, and last is BUY. A small machine in one corner of the shop proclaims that it manipulates keys. Three buttons are on the front of this machine beneath a narrow slot. Under the buttons is a much larger slot. The buttons read MAKE, DUPLICATE and INVALIDATE. To either side of the doorway are a pair of guards that appear to be deep in conversation about various pros and cons of each starship class. An ornate archway leads to another room, and hung above it is a sign with bold lettering proclaiming it to be a starship registry.

18:38 (Docking Bay) The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" begins to slowly float through the docking bay door from outside, being carefully guided by a small army of drones and a contingent of spaceport dock workers. After several moments of careful maneuvering, the ship sets down on the docking bay floor and the drones depart with the workers.

18:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Antares' Fire. We read your Commonwealth transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:50 You ask, "undock it for me?"

18:51 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door opens.

18:51 (Docking Bay) A number of drones swarm into the docking bay and begin securing several lines to the five-person transverser "Starlight Express". A number of the drones begin floating in the air, each carrying a line until the ship is gently hovering in the air. The drones then begin slowly hauling the ship out of the docking bay, carefully being guided by spaceport workers.

18:51 You smile.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

20:12 ["Starlight Express" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at "Antares' Fire" Docking Bay.

The large slab of metal which serves as this planet's landing pad has been set in the middle of a tiled plaza. Surrounding the busy landing area, the garishly colored tiles sparkle with an unnatural brightness. High railings and a steep set of stairs lead down from the metal platform, the sides of which have been buried in bobbing balloons in every color imaginable. A sprawling city spreads out from here, and decorating each light post and street corner are flamboyant party decorations to suit nearly any occasion.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the one-person fighter "Dragon's Fire" landed here.
You see balloons with happy faces on them tied to various light posts and Rico the droid here.
You can go north, east, southwest, and west.

20:41 [General Communication] Amy Draksen transmits, "It was actually never stated that we would have the job of destroying the kritzn production facility, just that we were giving HG the chance to find it. Many people assume that we will be given that task, though. Whether we will or not remains to be seen."

20:42 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "So back to the main issue. We got a kritzn base operating at full compacity, while HG sits on its rump, doing a trial. Just saying."

20:42 You say, "It won't let me dock the fighter."

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Partarirya; Landing Pad.
