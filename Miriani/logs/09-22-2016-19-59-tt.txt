Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at League Charge-Maintaining Battery-Powered Broadcast
Facility; Docking Bay.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers &
Troubleshooters", a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft
periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a
large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair
of mystic purple suede clogs here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a soft fuchsia silk nightie trimmed in lace. She is also wearing
an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet
of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both
shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

of new pilot applicants. There is a forth-coming election. Eric best does

your freedom of choice when the next election occurs."

better, I'd say that well, what I want to say could have disasterous results on
my piloting license."

woken to?"

ask."

[General Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "In space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I have my own views
of the government, and it isn't all very nice I'm afraid, so I usually keep my
nose out of things like that if I can."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are no wolves in space.
Only dogs."

something dangerous earlier."

wolves out there somewhere."

The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at League Charge-Maintaining Battery-Powered Broadcast

a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined

Molded as though covered by a tablecloth, this round table of finely grained
plastic is painted an overall deep sapphire blue. In the center of the table top
are the intertwined roots of four sugar maple trees, each extending from the
center of the table to one of the sides and representing a season on Old Earth.
The spring tree has new light green foliage, the summer tree has dark green
leaves lightly dusted with yellow flowers, the autumn tree is covered in leaves
of deep red, orange, and yellow, and the bare branches of the winter tree spring
out and upward from the trunk, forming a complex oval against the table top's
background. The entire table is lacquered for a hard, resilient finish.

dispenser, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot tea dispenser, a bulky

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is
detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The
transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a large purple and lavender

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Lily Kaise (League Paladin)
This is a thick heavy battlesuit, painted a mottled crimson with subdued dark
blue trim. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A bulky cockpit
encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a
framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A projectile
weapon attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A large attachment with a flare
launcher, targeting lasers, and many floodlights is mounted on the back of the
suit. A minidrone applicator is attached to the left wrist, a hose leading to a
bulky device on the back of the suit. A set of very thick armor plating covers
much of the suit.
It appears to be 12% damaged.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a large purple and lavender

Lily Kaise (League Paladin)
This is a thick heavy battlesuit, painted a mottled crimson with subdued dark
blue trim. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A bulky cockpit
encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a
framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A projectile
weapon attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A large attachment with a flare
launcher, targeting lasers, and many floodlights is mounted on the back of the
suit. A minidrone applicator is attached to the left wrist, a hose leading to a
bulky device on the back of the suit. A set of very thick armor plating covers
much of the suit.

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a large purple and lavender

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

really look for nests with embryos in them before you assume anything'

for embryos in the nests."

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I've emptied out ships carrying
felo which I was not the owner of before. Each time I did so, I would leave a
trough or bowl of food just in case I missed any. Then I'd check again later. If
the food had been touched, I'd know to look around again."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We have literally been
taking all of Eugene's ships to Hyperion. I guess we missed that embryo. But
since he's not filed flight plans in ages, I can't launch the mule."

them, let me know. I'm willing to help."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah, you can get a team of
people to help move felo pretty easily."

get enough people together to carry two each."

getting crowded."

key, Eve?"

capacity, because capacity is endless."

things. Woo!"

hole..."

spider chows for your totally existant spider."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eve, would you like some of us
to get together to search that or any other ships and help carry felo to
Hyperion?"

tugged the mule to hyperion. Might've been easier."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "More ships."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Ather, what is needed for
sensing array?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Can you get me list?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh and Damien G, mail me the
parts and the payment, and I'll get on your requested item."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Can you craft it for me now if I
bring you parts?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure, Aisling. I will send you
the list in a moment."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Mailing it to me would be much
faster at this moment than meeting."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Since I am doing other
crafty-related things."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "They are searching the ship
for nests Ather. So, the tug would not have helped."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It cleanses the neoh, aerial
fortress, I guess."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved purple top with a brightly colored
dragon print, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of strappy white leather
sandals. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, and a reactionless spacesuit jet. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship,
William Dove. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the
non-aggression pact."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If you think of anything else, now's the
time to go get it."
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
Lily Kaise grins at you.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.

The floor of this large round module vibrates occasionally, and a low rumble
fills the air. Bolted to the walls are large metal boxes with thick, variously
colored power cables running out of them and into the ceiling in bunches. Many
warning signs are stuck to the wall around a locked doorway, but across from it
another doorway roughly cut into the module appears to lead into a dark tunnel.

their rented ships."

before."

journalists."
[Newbie Help] Luja Garland transmits, "Ah, thanks."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The journalists are definitely
more correct about their assumptions where the pirates are concerned than the
posts are. The original posters tried to put a good light on a pirate, of all
things. Someone who basically steals from whoever, whenever and wherever they
want."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am happy to say that even
after 7 and a half years of having my license reinstated that I'm still not even
close to 50000 aggregate points! However, I don't know whether to be happy or
depressed about the fact that there are people who have been around for less
than half my time and are probably nearing in on that mark at a steady pace."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Oh, wow."

that much industry, either."

management station."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "She may not."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And yeah Akemi, I could
probably get it in not too much time at all. Especially since I have like, 2800
points just sitting in my belt management station, and I actually enjoy the
challenges that scooping has to offer, and it gives a decent bit of industry."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This can all only mean one
thing: I am a lazy butt."

having it."

salvage?"

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "He wishes."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No, I could make him do space

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So...the double speed plant,
what's the expected maximum velocity? I've got 121% now, and the plant isn't
qute fully grown, but almost."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, it will vary from ship to
ship. What was the initial startup max velocity on the ship you put it onto?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "110%."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So I'm getting an extra 11%
currently."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds about right then."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Has anyone put one of those
speed plants on a void piercer yet?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. I was wondering since it's

getting some insane amount of speed out of it."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's either an 11 or 12%
increase."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No more than that, though."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Did you put it onto like, a
runabout or something?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's ona reconnoiter."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Which gets 110% max velocity
as it is. So I'm quite pleased with the 121%. That's basically a void piercer,
if I recall."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm, not quite."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "About 2000 KM slower than a
void piercer."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I've never been on one.
I was thinking the void piercer was 121%...but maybe it's 123?"

full plant growth."

stock max velocity."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Right."

the reconnoiter."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, with the plant it's about
the same as an unmodified void piercer."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Was about equivalent to the
void piercer."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If both had plants though, the
void piercer would still easily outstrip it."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

exist to get folks to the point they can do high tier nests."

to."

[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "I only have a fringe 5."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Knock out doesn't work."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I know it doesn't work on
megabat, but was it ever tested on mother?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one ever said."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not sure."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "See? There must be tests
conducted!"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's doable, I just need to
figure out the best way."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Will you be the one conducting
those tests now ather?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, so Ather, Nicolette,
Melinda and Blake...go do a mother."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...mother nest."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what happens when you
release the button too soon."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport snickers.
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "I think we'd have to get ather
to stop watching his bot craft."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If we knock out mother,
destroy megabat, she will probably just call in reinforcements sooner."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It depends, Blake."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, but those mites mostly
are ineffectual. You can destroy them wiht very few hits."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Take a RATS suit in there,
nannoplasm."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyone around now that is
orange that might be interested in taking someone to get their colors at GMG
sometime this weekend?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "I can."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, I really think that
there'll be a higher chance of success if one of your damage suits was a RATS
suit. All of those debuffs, plus the gradual damage dealers like nanostream,
nanopulse, nanofire etc really add up nicely."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You're orange?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Red and yellow."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh god, we are on the same
page. Somebody help me."
[General Communication] Marco Giovani transmits, "Hello all."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, that's what I
meant...orange."
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in

[General Communication] Marco Giovani transmits, "Were there reports of my death
or retirement?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Marco, go wake up tali and
let's do a mother nest."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Oh I have no idea."
[General Communication] Marco Giovani transmits, "The last time she attempted to
do a mother nest, it went very, very, very bad for her, besides, I'm not sure
where she is presently."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "But Yes, RATS and all those
gradual damage abilities is what I was wanting to try."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's what I meant when I said
you can probably beat her without using knockout."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup, I'll try it."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only problem is you start to
lose energy very very fast."
Sassie the old large fuchsia felo gazes at Samantha the old large violet felo
for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even with a greater module of
energy generation/capacity, it's not easy for the suit to keep up with your
energy demands for that long."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yeah, very fast. So, RATS
suit will need to stick to Mother while the Fringe suit knocks out all that
other shit."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Get a spinward user instead and
let them go to town with resourcefulness."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Deeeeeath."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That could work."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know I don't know squat
about it...but...would it be possible to put two greater energy minimods on it?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "But, if we don't have one
available, I'd rather have RATS Fringe than say RATS Muty."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It would, but I don't think
it'd help too much."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, RATS/fringe is definitely
the better way to go."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Especially since the RATS suit
can boost the fringe suit's accuracy and damage even further alongside the
league's laser guidance and illuminate."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup, all nice things."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just costing much in energy."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am gonna write Kringle."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "He'll do this thing."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Fringe is your only high
tier suit Blake?"
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the north.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose I can help out on a
mother nest if there's room. We definitely can't take both Blake and Nicolette
on the same nest though, if we want a promising makeup of battlesuits. I mean
you guys can all go with Melinda, but I don't think that two fringe suits will
cut it on a mother nest."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "No, I will not take two
Fringe suits."
Sassie the old large fuchsia felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

to, Ather?"
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Sounds like a plan."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'd be up whenever."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "People who I craft for, people
who want temporary station modules on occasions, and...er, othe rpeople."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Especially since you didn't
answer me when I asked if Fringe was your only high tier suit."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "I didn't hear that. It is."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay then we cannot take
you both at the same time."
Sassie the old large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches out.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Probably for the best. This way
I can get mroe super quicksynths from more nests until I get the required number
that I can use to get people to craft nanowaves for me."

have my fingers crossed."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Who even knows if we're going
right now!? Ain't no one even told me what suit to bring."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I can go now."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Me too."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am indifferent as to our time
of departure."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm sure Nicolette is ready."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What tier 5 suits do you
have Ali?"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Fringe, Mutie, and League."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ha, ha."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Soon to have AEU. Most likely
tomorrow."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Fringe is out, Nicolette
will be using that."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So, Ather that leaves us
with RATS and AEU. Pick one for yourself."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am largely indifferent. Just
tell me what suit, where to meet, and I'll bring it and meet you."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm reasonably good at using
both."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'll let you try out the
RATS."
