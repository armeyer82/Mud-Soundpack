00:32:27  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:32:27 You are carrying nothing.

00:32:37 You scramble to your feet.

00:32:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:32:39 You exit the ship.

00:32:39 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

00:32:41 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:32:43 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:32:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:32:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:32:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:32:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:32:55 The ship is already moving.

00:32:58 The ship is already moving.

00:32:59 The ship is already moving.

00:32:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:33:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:33:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:33:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

00:33:06 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:33:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:33:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:51:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of tritium-rich hydrogen has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Wings Of An Angel". The organization has earned 7,423,835.05 credits.

00:52:45 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Good bye Joel."

00:53:06 Your communicator reports that...

00:53:06 
At least two recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

00:55:59 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

01:09:59 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:15:59 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

01:18:16 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:18:29 Lily Kaise snuggles up to your shoulder.

01:18:34 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:18:36 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:21:21 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:21:23 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:21:28 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:21:29 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:21:29 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:21:33 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:21:45 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

01:21:48 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:21:50 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:21:53 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:22:02 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:22:03 You laugh.

01:22:07 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:26:28 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:29:37 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

01:29:44 Lily Kaise strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

01:29:59 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:30:08 You stroke a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

01:30:11 You pet Lily Kaise on the head.

01:34:07 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

01:38:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

01:43:59 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:45:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Interesting."

01:45:51 [General Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "What is?"

01:45:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The latest headline."

01:46:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo suddenly jumps onto a dark purple leather captain's chair.

01:50:37 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Interestin' indeed. Hmm."

01:50:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

01:52:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Reality". The organization has earned 94,775.16 credits.

01:58:59 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the south.

01:59:07 You stroke the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

01:59:07 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

01:59:23 Lily says to you, "I don't see the asteroid processor up in 285. I thought that Evenia would take care of it but I suppose she isn't. Do you want to go with me to go put one up if it's needed?"

01:59:35 You say to Lily, "Sure."

02:01:03 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] 160,000,000.00 credits have been deducted from the starship support fund.

02:01:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "The results are in!"

02:01:06 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I put everything in my scout so I'll have to push it out of there and load it back onto the builder. I guess we could just take the stuff out there and build the old-fashioned way but that area is prone to intruders so would rather not take a chance. So I will go push them out and then we'll go salvage the parts up and build and then go out there."

02:01:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We did it! We achieved all of our performance goals!"

02:01:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up 165.4% from the last Conquest period."

02:01:27 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:01:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:01:29 I don't see that here.

02:01:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Woo. Everyone thank all grand contributions from expedition points."

02:01:32 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Woooo."

02:01:46 Lily Kaise says, "I did that for Evenia so it would be easy but I don't think people should have to go without."

02:01:51 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:01:54 You nod.

02:01:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:01:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:02:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:02:10 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:02:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:02:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:02:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:02:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:02:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:02:18 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:02:19 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

02:02:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:02:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:02:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:02:23 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:02:24 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:02:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:02:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:02:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:02:28 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:02:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

02:02:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:02:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:02:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:02:33 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:02:36 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

02:02:37 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:02:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

02:02:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:02:50 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:02:55 Accord of Free Worlds Command (Accord) [Human Interalliance Space] (Security: Beta-2)

02:02:55 Coordinate rundown:

Beacon Housings: (12, 7, 8)


02:02:59 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches south.

02:03:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:03:08 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:03:12 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:03:13 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

02:03:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:03:15 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:03:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:03:41 You're already standing.

02:03:44 Lily Kaise asks, "Hmm so I'll go push that stuff out and I'll let you know when to go salvage it with the constructor?"

02:03:49 You say, "Sure."

02:03:54 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:03:57 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:03:57 You ask, "You want me to take herding cats, right?"

02:03:58 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:04:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:04:06 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.

02:04:09 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]

02:04:09 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:04:11 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

02:04:11 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

02:05:25 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,367,968.75 credits from a xenology submission.

02:05:38 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Not a great haul I will admit."

02:08:15 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:08:21 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:08:26 Lily Kaise grins.

02:08:28 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:08:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:08:37 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:08:42 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

02:08:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:08:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:08:54 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:08:54 You grin.

02:09:02 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris (nearest).

02:09:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:09:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:09:11 You activate the expert salvage electromagnetic manipulator and begin scanning for debris.

02:09:16 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:09:18 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a basic control center module.

02:09:19 There is no more nearby debris.

02:09:21 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Main Deck]

02:09:21 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

You can go up.

02:09:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:09:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:09:50 A small light near the massive bay door blinks alarmingly for a moment, then subsides.

02:10:00 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Put your suit on love."

02:10:06 A small light near the massive bay door blinks alarmingly for a moment, then subsides.

02:10:10 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

02:10:10 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:10:11 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

02:10:14 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok, go for it."

02:10:17 A small light near the massive bay door blinks for a few seconds, then the door begins to slowly rumble open. You grab onto a handhold as atmosphere rushes out of the bay.

02:10:22 Lily Kaise flies in from above.

02:10:24 Lily Kaise pulls a length of air hose from the reel.

02:10:28 Lily Kaise pulls a length of power feed cable from the reel.

02:10:32 Use what?

02:10:34 You pull a length of power feed cable from the reel.

02:10:37 You pull a length of air hose from the reel.

02:10:45 Lily Kaise says to you, "Ok we're using the last core and the last basic control."

02:18:12 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

02:19:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:19:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:19:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:19:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:21:01 a temporary space station core module (contributed by Rift Surfers) (attached)

02:21:01 This is a core module.
This is the basic core of every temporary space station.
It has other modules attached to it.

02:21:02 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:21:04 You grin.

02:21:07 The core module should remain freefloating. Attach other modules to it.

02:21:13 Are you sure you wish to create a temporary space station out of a temporary space station core module (contributed by Rift Surfers) (attached), an electromagnetic sifting asteroid processor module (contributed by Business Cats, Allied Libertarians, Spatial Stability, Morning Star, and Unlimited Potential) (attached), a storage container unmanned pickup module (contributed by Space Invaders) (attached), a basic active stealth system module (contributed by The Society For Harmonious Interstellar Teamwork) (attached), a fission breeder reactor module (contributed by Starseekers and Space Explorers Amidst The Stars) (attached), and a basic control center module (contributed by Risoluto E Unisono Noblezza Espressione) (attached)?

02:21:26 You flip open a small panel, extend a lever, then give it a twist. The new space station's attached modules engage their permanent interlocks. The station is ready to be launched!

02:21:26 (30 seconds roundtime.)
A temporary space station core module (contributed by Rift Surfers) (attached) is already attached.

02:21:36 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

02:21:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok on our way!"

02:21:37 Lily Kaise glides up.

02:21:40 Wait 16 seconds.

02:21:42 A small light near the massive bay door blinks for a few seconds, then the door begins to slowly slide closed. After a moment, air begins to fill the bay.

02:22:11 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

02:22:12 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

02:22:12 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

02:22:12 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:22:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:22:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:22:15 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

02:22:16 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:22:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

02:22:17 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

02:22:21 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:22:21 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
Wait 2 seconds.

02:22:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:22:23 You stand up.

02:22:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

02:22:29 Wait 1 seconds.

02:22:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:22:29 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:22:29 You stand up.

02:22:30 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

02:22:31 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:22:31 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:22:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:22:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:22:34 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:22:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

02:22:36 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:22:36 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:22:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:22:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:22:42 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2494 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northnorthwest and Slightly Up."

02:22:42 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

02:22:51 Lily Kaise points at a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:22:56 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:22:59 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

02:22:59 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 181,754.79 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

02:23:00 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:23:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:23:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:23:11 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:23:15 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:23:20 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

02:23:30 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:23:31 I don't understand that.

02:23:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:28:44 Star Conquest Help: Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying
--
Category: Activities
--
This help file describes various scientific tasks you can perform on points of interest you find in deep space. Points of interest can be nearly anything -- asteroid clusters, nebulas, star systems, and more! You will find these objects at intervals when exploring in deep space, and your first step is to simply approach them and have your ship arrive within the area of interest. After that, there are several things you can do, depending on your ship's equipment, to study the object. The data you bring back home is likely to be very valuable!

IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, AND ANALYZING

Space imaging is described in detail in the Space Imaging help file.

Once your starship has space imaging equipment, it can be augmented with a series of spectroscopes and scanners sold by Central Stellar Cartography at the main location on The Torus. The command to begin using this equipment is SPECTROSCOPE. Once started, the computer will iterate through all of the analysis equipment it has available. If you wish, the scan can be aborted by repeating the command. The data gathered will be stored in the ship's surveying databanks -- more on this below!

PLANETARY SURVEYING

Certain points of interests will be planetary systems! Exoplanets are of particular interest to scientists back home and are always an exciting find.

The first step, if your ship has the necessary planetary surveyor, is to use the SURVEY command. This will begin a series of scans that will eventually locate and plot the orbits of all planets in the system.

Once the planets are found, you can use the JUMP command to have your ship perform a field triangulation and travel via wormhole to your newly discovered planets! However, this is where your advancement of scientific understanding ends... unless, of course, you also have probes aboard, as detailed in the next section!

PROBES AND LANDERS

If you have enough points, you may purchase a probe launcher from Central Stellar Cartography. It can then be loaded with probes at any CSC branch using the usual MENU and BUY commands. If you find you have too many of a particular type of probe, you can unload them for some of your money back using the SELL command.

Probes are used to study points of interest as well as individual planets. Each probe can be deployed using one of three programs: close approach, extended observation, or lander. A close approach probe is simply fired directly at an object and transmits telemetry for as long as it can, often right up until it impacts. An extended observation probe orbits or holds station near an object for at least several hours, gathering much more information. And a lander will gather information about the surface of a planet.

You do not need to stay and wait for a probe to complete a lengthy observation. If you return to the site at any time after a probe has completed its program, it will transmit the data to your ship within a minute or so. Since both probes and time are limited, it is a good idea to save them for particularly worthy targets, like green planets or exotic objects.

DISCOVERER CREDIT

Discoverers are the first people to image, survey, scan, or probe a new point of interest and will be accorded a certain special status forever. If you cannot complete all possible tasks at a point of interest, then any future followup work will still be credited to any qualifying discoverers, even if they are not on the new crew.

Uncertain if you're the first one to visit an area, or which studies have already been performed? Be sure to get the CSC's onboard library upgrade and use the LIBRARY command!

DATABANKS

Images are physical hardcopies and planetary surveys are stored in the ship's main databanks, but all other data is stored on special surveying databanks. These databanks have a limited capacity depending on the type of ship, which can be viewed with the DATABANKS command. This capacity can be extended with upgrades.

CREDITS FOR DATA

Surveying data can be transferred to any Central Stellar Cartography branch using the SUBMIT command. Crew members must individually submit their planets, but only the ship's owner can submit the contents of its databanks. Once the data is processed, each member w
02:28:44 ill be mailed their reward and given the appropriate points.

02:33:16 Lily Kaise says, "Oh we're ok."

02:33:21 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I don see how. Jacob is with me."

02:33:22 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:33:22 Lily Kaise deftly enters a set of coordinates, and the computer chirps in confirmation.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: (1, 20, 10).

02:33:23 You say, "Yeah, no one here."

02:33:25 You scramble to your feet.

02:33:25 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Main Deck]
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

02:33:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:33:28 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

02:33:28 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:33:30 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

02:33:34 This is a completed temporary station ready for launch. (You may USE it when the ship is in space to launch the station.)

02:33:41 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I was just being silly. She did nothing with Jacob, I assume."

02:33:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:34:01 [General Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "How could I have done anything with anyone I was alone."

02:34:10 A small light near the massive bay door blinks for a few seconds, then the door begins to slowly rumble open. You grab onto a handhold as atmosphere rushes out of the bay.

02:34:15 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok go for it."

02:34:19 Are you sure you wish to launch a temporary space station created out of a temporary space station core module (contributed by Rift Surfers) (attached), an electromagnetic sifting asteroid processor module (contributed by Business Cats, Allied Libertarians, Spatial Stability, Morning Star, and Unlimited Potential) (attached), a storage container unmanned pickup module (contributed by Space Invaders) (attached), a basic active stealth system module (contributed by The Society For Harmonious Interstellar Teamwork) (attached), a fission breeder reactor module (contributed by Starseekers and Space Explorers Amidst The Stars) (attached), and a basic control center module (contributed by Risoluto E Unisono Noblezza Espressione) (attached)?

Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

02:35:05 Lily Kaise presses a button marked MODULE BAY DOOR.

02:35:05 A low vibration runs through the starship as the module bay door closes.

02:35:06 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

02:35:06 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:35:06 [General Communication] Tare Jacob Smitt transmits, "Your beautiful, thank you."

02:35:06 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

02:35:19 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:35:19 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

02:35:27 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "This son of a person type creature."

02:35:27 I don't understand that.

02:35:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:35:38 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:35:38 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

02:35:39 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:35:41 You grin at Lily Kaise. "I certainly think you're beautiful."

02:35:48 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

02:35:49 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:35:49 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:35:53 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Thank you Lily."

02:35:59 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

02:36:08 I don't see "liy" here.

02:36:10 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:36:15 Lily Kaise says, "That always embarrasses me a tad I just look like a lot of the women in Cape Myers."

02:36:34 You say to Lily, "I doubt it."

02:36:45 You say to Lily, "I bet none are as pretty as you."

02:36:49 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

02:36:56 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:37:01 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:37:04 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:37:04 Lily says to you, "Thank you Love."

02:38:33 Lily says to you, "Heh if Nissi says we're leaving this morning will you be ready?"

02:38:50 [Tactical Communication] Tare Jacob Smitt transmits, "One spot, Missions."

02:39:24 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:39:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:39:51 You say, "Sure."

02:39:53 You grin.

02:40:05 Lily Kaise says, "Ok just be sure your felo have enough chow in the hold."

02:40:19 You say, "I took care of that."

02:40:20 You grin.

02:41:13 Lily Kaise says, "I personally wanted to go to Helios but if we were leaving this morning, would just use the chow from the trade shop."

02:41:18 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Missions already left yet?"

02:41:27 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:41:30 Lily Kaise says, "Aww he only hadone spot."

02:41:31 [Tactical Communication] Tare Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well no."

02:41:32 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "No."

02:41:33 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:41:38 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:41:38 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

02:41:39 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:41:41 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

02:41:42 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:41:44 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Woo."

02:41:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:41:48 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Awesome."

02:42:07 You say to Lily, "You want  to go?"

02:42:10 The starship transitions into another sector.

02:42:12 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2455 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northnorthwest and Slightly Up."

02:42:13 Lily Kaise says, "No it's ok."

02:42:17 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

02:42:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:42:17 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

02:42:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:42:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:42:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:42:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:42:25 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

02:42:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:42:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:42:29 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:42:30 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:42:36 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:42:36 Lily Kaise says, "If there were two spots, yeah, I'd go but I don't need the points."

02:42:37 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:42:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:42:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:42:40 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:42:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

02:42:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:42:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:42:45 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:42:46 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can join if you need one more. Lily can join too if there are spots."

02:42:48 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

02:42:58 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:42:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

02:43:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:43:03 [Tactical Communication] Tare Jacob Smitt transmits, "I would, but I don't have a cruiser."

02:43:17 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I might have one or two lying around."

02:43:26 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:43:26 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

02:43:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Raging seas!"

02:43:39 [Tactical Communication] Tare Jacob Smitt transmits, "If you could bring it to old Earth, that would be incredible."

02:43:46 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Will do."

02:43:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:43:51 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:43:56 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

02:43:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:44:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:44:06 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:44:06 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Give us a couple. We're en route from accord as jsut built the asteroid processor in 285."

02:44:11 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:44:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:44:13 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:44:29 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:44:31 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:44:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:44:39 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:44:44 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

02:44:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:44:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:44:59 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:44:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:45:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:45:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:45:05 Lily Kaise asks, "I think jacob is a good enough pilot to fly it don't you?"

02:45:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:49:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:49:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Missions missions missions you know one of you wants a mission!"

02:49:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:49:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:49:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:49:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:49:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:49:43 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:49:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Raging Seas. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:49:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:50:49 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.

04:12:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Raging Seas. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

04:12:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:12:44 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

04:12:46 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah would be fine."

04:12:47 Tare Jacob Smitt says into the PA microphone, "Captain told me to land here."

04:12:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:12:49 You are credited with 3,540,406.33 AEU credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

04:12:54 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:13:01 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok, we cando that."

04:13:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:13:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Raging Seas, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:13:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:13:09 Tare Jacob Smitt smirks.

04:13:09 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Only lost 1 failsafe."

04:13:12 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 476" has jumped out of the sector.

04:13:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:13:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:13:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:13:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:27 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:13:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:31 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Control lobby please."

04:13:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:32 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:33 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

04:13:33 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:13:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:35 You hear a sudden high-pitched whine all over the ship as the engineer effects swift repair of all components.

04:13:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:38 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:13:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:42 Guindalen Jones glides in from the south.

04:13:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:13:45 Guindalen Jones glides south.

04:13:45 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Raging Seas. Welcome to Accord space."

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

04:17:58 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

04:18:00 Tare Jacob Smitt strolls in from the south.

04:18:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:18:08 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire and Lily Kaise.

04:18:08 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:18:11 Not ejected.

04:18:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:18:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Raging Seas, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

04:18:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:18:21 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:18:26 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:18:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:18:32 Lily Kaise smiles at you.
The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:18:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:18:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:18:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:18:38 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "The Impossible Knife Of Memory" has launched from Old Earth.

04:18:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:18:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:18:39 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:18:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:18:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:18:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:18:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:18:44 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:18:47 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Raging Seas! Welcome to home space!"

04:19:02 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

04:19:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:19:05 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:19:05 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 988" has landed on the planet New Earth.

04:19:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Raging Seas. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:19:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:19:12 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The wantz wantz what it wantz."

04:19:16 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:19:19 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:19:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

05:57:05 You say to Lily, "You know. I'm surprised that Morris is allowed to launch Starseekers's cruiser. I thought an cruiser qualified, AEU pilot had to be aboard for it to launch. I guess I was mistaken."

05:57:21 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah me too."

05:57:39 Lily Kaise asks, "Are you sure? Perhaps as long as an aEU pilot is aboard?"

05:58:00 You say, "I'm not sure now. That could be the case."

05:59:45 Star Conquest Help: Large Starship Requirements
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Cruiser-class starships have a license point requirement like any other starship. However, they also have certain other requirements, to help ensure that these expensive warships end up only in the most capable hands.

To own a cruiser, you must first have 5,000 lock evasion points. Lock evasion points are gained in the course of navigating in battle and avoiding being hit.

Note: If you are being credited with weapon hits, you will not be credited with lock evasions. This is done in order to avoid doubling the rate of combat point gain of pilots of smaller ships.

An aspiring cruiser owner is also required to complete eight qualifying beacon drops as navigator. Qualifying beacon drops are at the high level or above, and involve a single ship which is of a gunship class or larger. In addition, the pilot in the control room must be alone and without assistance for the duration of the beacon drop, and the beacon drop cannot be interrupted -- meaning the ship cannot leave the sector before the beacon drop has been completed.

A pilot can work towards these requirements at any time, and a capable aspiring cruiser owner is likely to meet them in the process of gaining the required points.

You can check your qualifications at any time with the INFO command.

Existing cruisers require their owner to be qualified before they can launch. If 
05:59:45 the cruiser is owned by an organization, at least one cruiser-qualified pilot must be aboard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

17:27:40 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will be out at 285 if anyone decides they would like to haul with me."

17:29:11 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

17:30:03 Lily says to you, "Hey let's see how the bubble might work to grab some artifacts to help us meet our org goal?"

17:30:19 You grin. "Ok. Sure."

17:30:24 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:30:29 Lily says to you, "Hey let's see how the bubble might work to grab some artifacts to help us meet our org goal?'I just don't want to drag you along out there if you'd rather not go?"

17:30:42 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I don't mind tagging along."

17:30:50 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

17:30:51 You say, "I'll grab a few if I can too."

17:30:52 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

17:30:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:30:56 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

17:31:03 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:31:07 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:31:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:31:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:31:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:31:27 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

17:31:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:31:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:31:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

17:31:33 The computer reports that the one-person fighter "Turbulent Trajectory" has landed on the planet New Earth.

17:31:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:31:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:31:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:31:36 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: rK[lg=9y*9\Xq<R_+{!DsU+<IaiH}2Kp}P=IGT>s
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:31:37 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

17:31:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:31:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:31:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:31:41 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:31:42 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

17:31:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:31:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:31:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:31:46 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:31:47 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

17:31:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:31:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:31:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:31:54 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2018 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southeast and Slightly Down."

17:31:54 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

17:32:02 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

17:32:07 Lily Kaise says, "Oh hum."

17:32:12 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

17:32:30 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

17:32:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:32:50 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

17:32:54 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:32:56 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

17:32:56 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

17:32:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:32:57 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

17:32:58 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

17:33:25 Lily Kaise says, "I guess it's moot as it's not available."

17:33:29 You say, "Oh."

17:33:32 You ask, "Really?"

17:33:34 Lily Kaise says, "Let's see."

17:33:34 You say, "Hmmm."

17:34:12 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

17:35:53 Lily Kaise says, "Weird."

17:36:13 Lily Kaise says, "It's showing up on the reference but not accessible from here."

17:36:16 You ask, "No beacon set up for the Bubble?"

17:36:18 You say, "Oh."

17:36:21 You say, "Weird."

17:36:38 Lily Kaise says, "Let's see."

17:36:41 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

17:37:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:37:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:37:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:37:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:37:59 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

17:38:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, a wal
17:38:00 l-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

17:38:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:38:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:38:02 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:38:02 I don't understand that.

17:38:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:38:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:38:04 You say, "Oops."

17:38:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:38:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:38:07 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:38:09 You say, "Sorry."

17:38:10 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

17:38:11 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

17:38:15 You say, "I didn't mean to do that."

17:38:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:38:19 You laugh.

17:38:24 Lily Kaise says, "I was like..."

17:38:25 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Kappa-3" has launched from New Earth.

17:38:26 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Upsilon-2" has launched from New Earth.

17:38:37 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:38:45 Lily Kaise says, "Ok going to check the market."

17:38:45 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Kappa-3" has jumped out of the sector.

17:38:47 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

17:38:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:38:47 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Upsilon-2" has jumped out of the sector.

17:38:50 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

17:38:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Space Market.

17:38:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:38:58 You say, "Ok."

17:39:02 The computer reports that the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 306" has jumped into the sector.

17:39:06 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Unreality Programming 306. Welcome to New Earth Orbit."

17:39:28 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:39:28 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

17:39:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh would you please check your workbench to see if you have the Arachnoid Chassis blueprint? Otherwise, I'll just put it up for sale."

17:39:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

17:39:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:39:47 You say, "Sure."

18:43:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

18:43:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:43:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:43:32 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:43:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:43:49 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

18:43:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:43:53 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:44:42 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

19:14:15 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

19:14:27 Lily Kaise says, "I don't hear the other side of that conversation."

19:15:08 Lily Kaise taps a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

19:15:12 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

19:15:12 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

19:35:43 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot,

19:51:38 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo.

19:51:38 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

20:55:23 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

20:55:48 Lily says to Xavier the old big silver soldier felo, "Will so miss you and your buddy. I'm just glad you both waited for us."

20:56:06 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise.

20:56:12 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

20:56:41 Lily Kaise says, "I guess I told you I found Blueberry's collar and tail ribbons right in here when we came back. It was sad."

20:57:38 Lily Kaise says, "She at least was with us longer than Buddy."

20:57:54 You nod.

20:59:15 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo rubs up against Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo, and both animals purr softly.

22:20:44 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

22:21:04 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

22:21:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Gonna be hard to keep exploration up like that without more big trips. Would be awesome though."

22:21:56 Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

22:22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nah just everyone does a lot of artifacting and GMG and stuff."

22:24:21 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:24:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep Exploration is typically at the bottom of the food chain. It's fantastic that it carried so much weight this time."

22:24:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Just means we must make it at least not the bottom."

22:25:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:25:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have about 100 Belt management. I was going to turn them in but I think I'll hold off."

22:25:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I would suggest at least trying to make it third."

22:26:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Make ground combat the bottom."

22:26:57 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Would anyone would be up for an archaeological site?"

22:28:15 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:29:35 [Tactical Communication] Pilot Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Sure."

22:30:43 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:30:43 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo slides to the floor.

22:30:45 Lily Kaise glides south.

22:33:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's quite hard to do Vern. It just doesn't seem to be worth that much as far as conquest goes. I've seen times when several Union pilots just did nothing but artifacting and it was still on the bottom. We'll still try of course, just don't be surprised if it still stays low."

22:34:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think the points we earn for exploration actually count as much as say, industry. Industry seems to affect it the most, and not just because so many folks do it."

22:34:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's a pipedream, in fact. The only reason it was so high this time was because like five of us were on an expedition and most of us returned with several hundred exploration points eventually awarded."

22:35:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Industry and space combat."

22:35:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Pipedreams only occur when folks don't want to make something a reality."

22:35:16 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

22:35:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I certainly appreciate the enthusiasm, but yeah."

22:36:16 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

22:36:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'd literally either have to spend your whole conquest period doing nothing but exploration, and having like 3-4 other pilots doing the same, or you'd have to go on an artifacting run at one of the farther alien artifacting fields like hall of pain, chamber of wrath etc."

22:37:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Then I will do that when I hit 300 exploration then."

22:37:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah ther, and I remember a few times where we basically did just that, had everybody artifacting, and it still didn't make a difference."

22:38:03 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

22:38:03 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.
A personal hoverpallet floats in behind Lily Kaise.

22:38:09 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:38:16 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

22:38:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh you can get quite a few points and lots of credits by doing that Vern. I used to just camp out in the bubble until I had to go back for lack of charge. But in something like a Void Piercer that actually gives you a ton of time to artifact."

22:39:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Even nicer these days, because of the accelerators, and being able to still talk on comms."

22:40:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, you can take a better ship along. With the artifacting expeditions we tended to run down the line, we generally used a recharging station with a passive beacon onboard and a repair center as well."

22:40:16 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

22:40:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We'd put a hypercaster on it for the people who wanted to talk to pilots back home, but yeah."

22:41:24 Lily Kaise removes an elegant crystal decanter from a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.

22:41:31 Lily Kaise puts an elegant crystal decanter in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

22:43:06 Lily Kaise says to you, "Ok I will be away for a few hours. If Nissi says load up and let's go, please just get the aquariums as we have 5 between us, Higgins and there's 2 or 3 trays of spider chow. I reset Purr yesterday so that's all ok. Otherwise, I'll see you when I get back."

22:43:17 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Ok."

22:43:21 You say, "I will."

22:43:29 Lily Kaise points at the hoverpallet folling her.

22:43:33 You nod.

22:44:16 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

22:44:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:48:16 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

22:50:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Woo, I have 743 belt points!"

22:51:23 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm might as well go pay them."

22:51:25 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

22:51:25 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:51:28 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:51:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:51:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:51:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:51:47 You nod.

22:51:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:51:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:51:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:51:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:51:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:51:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:51:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:51:58 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:51:59 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

22:52:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:52:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:52:04 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Glittering Belt."

22:52:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:52:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:52:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:52:08 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:52:11 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

22:52:13 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:52:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

22:52:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:52:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:52:59 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

22:53:03 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:53:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

22:53:07 Lily Kaise pushes a button on a personal hoverpallet.

22:53:07 A personal hoverpallet beeps and stops following Lily Kaise.

22:53:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:53:15 Lily Kaise glides out.

22:53:15 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise.

22:53:17 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:53:19 You peer out...

22:53:19 
[Asteroid Belt Management Station]
This is an asteroid belt management station. Through large transparisteel windows, you can see the asteroid stations themselves glittering amongst the tumbling asteroids of the belt. The station managers need never actually visit these stations, however, instead conducting their business via a number of terminals.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:53:50 I don't understand that.

22:53:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

22:53:53 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, and a personal hoverpallet here.

22:56:16 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

22:56:26 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:56:28 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

22:56:28 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.

22:56:31 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:56:35 Lily Kaise pushes a button on a personal hoverpallet.

22:56:35 A personal hoverpallet beeps and begins following Lily Kaise.

22:56:37 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

22:56:42 A launch trajectory is located.

22:56:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:56:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.
