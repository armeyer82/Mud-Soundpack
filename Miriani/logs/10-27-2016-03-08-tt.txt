-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay
Four.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named
Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, an insulated blue cooler, a high tech silver star print holovid, a
red plastic food storage container, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.

you can move to next or previous."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oldest ones go in the bin."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
kt1YI:2qw|KI+TJH7{S*8I{yJ?:["!\p/l7_gd#2
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2321 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southeast
and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
nod lily 'I know.
You nod to Lily Kaise. "I know."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I thought I was seeing things as I so
forgot I was holding her."
squeeze lily
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock
Four).
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for docking clearance.
A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free
Worlds port."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Be right back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Going to go look at modules."
Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

Anyone is welcome to come! People with little or no experience using rift ships
are who this is intended for, but even if you've made many trips and gotten out
of all sorts of scrapes you're welcome to come too. This is going to be a short
trip, from Gateway to Helios. We will meet up in Tandem station, dock beta, at
0030 on October 21st. This trip shouldn't take more than four hours at most (and
probably less).
I intend to cover the basics of: 
*Adjusting ship heading
*Using non-directional beacon locators for navigation
*Using rift beacon autotravel navigation from a deep space start
*Ship system power management
*Ship sensor signature management
*Hypercaster use as a navigation aid
*Appropriate use of active long range scanner systems
*Terminal approach techniques
This is taking place after Melinda's trip has left. If you're going on her trip,
I expect you'll learn much the same skills from her and her crew.

You say, "Ah, ok."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Roid hauling out-of-comms, but
I thought that was later today?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So that will hopefully sell this but

Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather captain's chair.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
}+MBvA9mdjuu}N]?0!l1w=RKo%r}RU}?D0*naQ'l
sit lily
You sit down on Lily Kaise's lap.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2437 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southeast
and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, welcome to Belt of Orion. As you travel to the bubble or one of the
asteroid stations, fly safe, keep an eye on your charge and make sure to have
enough EAOS credits for the tolls. Have a nice day!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Striking Distance.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
ftl 285
This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 7,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do
you wish to pay this?
[Enter `yes' or `no']
y
You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Allowing
external rift insertion. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
wrap lily
You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Lily Kaise kisses you.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a
planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The
wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an
eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise activates the ultimate salvage sensor and begins scanning for chunks
of debris.
The salvage sensor reports detection of a small shipwreck (grade 30) at a range
of 168000km at Sector Southwest and Up, a small shipwreck (grade 30) at a range

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily

Artifact Beacon Alpha 777 - Final Resting Place of New Earth 40th
A new Artifacting area for Local artifacts and at least Grade 30 shipwrecks is
now available.
From B-24, travel via the Rift AcceleratorInserter to Alpha 777.
Return via Home Alpha 776 and travel to the next sector East which is B-24.
A Transmitter has been deployed in the Alpha 777 beaconed sector. Although it
improves communications slightly, it is not quite strong enough to boost signals
sufficient enough for totally clear communications.
At this time, no toll is required. However, to support the expense of the
accelerators and related components, if this area remains viable, we will more
than likely need to begin charging a toll in the future. Enjoy it while you can
and please let me or Shule know what you think.

[Newbie Help] Klave Andaran transmits, "Just bought a watch and notived that the
time was displayed a bit differently that I am used to. Is this something my
character would already know about?"
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits,
"Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards
Galactic East."
Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.
Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.
The starship transitions into another sector.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Wow we didn't even drink any wine!"
Lily Kaise laughs.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
You laugh.
Lily Kaise picks up an elegant crystal decanter.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Lily Kaise puts an elegant crystal decanter in a lavender silk backpack
embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It is something your character probably
doesn't know in character yet, but it's easy enough to learn in character."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The simple answer is that yeah, it's a
different method of marking time."
[Newbie Help] Luja Garland transmits, "From my understanding, that's the
"proper" way to tell the time. I think it's called cyclic time, and it can be
compared to... like us on Old Earth using arbitrary units like inches and feet
and yard, while cyclical is like metric that tries to be more uniform."

How many light-years travel is this and have you also put a salvage station up?
If not this grade 30 shipwrecks is not going to assist people. It is still my
personal opinion that we do not need three salvage stations in comm range. I
think this battle of shipwrecks or no shipwrecks has been done to death.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a felo nest, a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl, a sleeping big
blue soldier felo, a hefty violet soldier felo, a frisky big red felo, a large

Even though this starship garage smells like machine oil and heavy lubricants,
it is spacious and well-lit. Massive hydraulic systems raise and lower starships
to and from the landing pad above, and technicians and mechanics in silvery gray

which leads to the pilot's lounge is here. The distinct smell of death is

without a rift drive and have traveled to some place via the accelerator. Can
you autotravel back to that accelerator if it has the inserter on it? From say,
200 sectors out?"

rescue any person more often than maybe once, if they are new enough to pilot
life maybe."

to find their way, or to get help from say battle of Mir."

than 10."

The heading to travel is 115 25 from B-24. The approximate distance is 9.55
Light-Years or 1.23 Light-Trade Cycles. I agree that in theory, that we don't
need three Salvage stations but if SEAS could qualify to provide one we
certainly would. If a toll is added, I know that if we only had one salvage
processor, others wouldn't find it very economical in terms of their time and
expense to pay a toll per every time they needed to shuttle their load of
salvage from either 285 or 777 to Orion. Therefore, I personally don't see
anything wrong with their being a salvage station being available whereever
needed. Still there is of course, the expense and the level of effort required
to maintain yet another Temporary Space Station. Finally, this is merely an
experiment to observe whether or not that this field is a better alternative
than Battle of Mir which only yields one grade 0 to 10 shipwreck per sector
whereas 777 yields 4 shipwrecks per sector as well as Local Artifacts. It may be
that this particular area isn't worthwhile to continue to support in the future.

Orion will handle people's salvage needs up to grade 20 or 30. You are starting
up this old shipwreck verses commets and roids again. This is nuts.

You asked for information Melinda. I responded. You subsequently made a
statement and I responded to it. I didn't ask anyone for a Salvage Processor. So
I didn't start up anything. Others have been asking for another area of
shipwrecks with Local artifacts so I invested quite a bit in this project for
others. If noone wants it in the long run, then it will not continue to be
supported by myself, SEAS and of course Cats for the Rift Inserters and the Rift
Accelerators. Anything offered to continue the operation is welcomed. It goes
without saying that a toll should be required for all future support of this
area.

I would like to point out that not only did you use Cats parts without
permission. They weren't the only ones who paid for those parts. You abitrarily
decided to use parts paid for by Cats, Libs, Morning Star and Spatial Stability
without permission. from at least one of those organizations

Hi Melinda,
Awhile back, someone from Cats placed two High-powered Accelerators and two
Inserters aboard Herding Cats. This was shortly after I discussed with you that
I wanted to experiment with this area. I thought it was your responding to go
ahead. I just hadn't had the opportunity to invest the time to put things into
place. If I mis-understood the intent of the parts, then I apologize and I
certainly don't mind repaying Cats for these or any future parts. Obviously if
there is anything built in the area which provides income to other
organizations, noone will be left out. However since this is experimental, I
didn't want to burden other organizations to provide modules which yield
absolutely no income or otherwise to them. Again, as I said in the post on
General, i do believe a toll is required in the future if support is to be
continued. Otherwise, after this initial setup, I'll likely not invest in this
project.
Best Regards,
Lily Kaise

Morris says to Lily, "I know that. I was wondering what the range out there was.
The only number I heard thrown around was 30, so I didn't know if it was 20-40,
10-30, or what?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ah ok."
Nicolette says to Melinda, "This is a lot of pressure for somebody that woke up
a grand total of fifteen minutes ago at the most. When do you need an answer?"
nod nicolette
You nod to Nicolette Lawrence.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "It doesn't yield more points if you
factor in travel time and the fact that you can salvage the roids faster."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "There's time, the new thing is
there now regardless, it's not like we can blast it out of the sky."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I used to think it did. If it
does, it's a minimal difference when you factor in everything involved."
Morris says to Nicolette in an Appalachian accent, "Well..."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Right so."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "They don't want to vote right now."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "When does the salvage spot at 285 go
down?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "A week or so."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I think it's my civic duty to
try to make the appropriate decision. And I'm not sure I'm capable of doing that
when I'm still largely asleep."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
light transport "Registered Merchant 551".
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Sure, if you want to spend 12 hours
filling up your ship with tiny bits, it will give you a nice amount of points.
But the question we must ask ourselves if 12 hours bringing in more loads with
bigger pieces would not accomplish the same."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We put the new one up on Sunday."
Damien Goss asks in a Malagasy accent, "Breeder?"
Morris says to Kim, "It basically does."
Damien Goss asks in a Malagasy accent, "Is it on a fision breeder?"
Melinda Michaels nods to Damien Goss.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Which is why I quit advocating for
shipwrecks."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "You always have to put those on a
breeder reactor."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Most salvage stations are on a
fission breader."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Breeder has 12 days of lifetime
regardless of what's on it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Or a source like in Orion."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "So 8 days give or take a few hours."
A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki crouches down for a
moment.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "So then for now, 285 is it. If
things change, give me some good info before it drops or it stays. For the
record, the vote has so far decided this, not me alone."
You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.
Kim Saunders nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok then once 777 goes down, it won't be
maintained by SEAS. It's up to you all to keep it going if you want it."
Tobias Hawthorne takes a bite of a warm butterscotch cookie.
Melinda says to Lily, "You can maintain it if people use it. I am sure we will
help with parts."
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
one-person cargo hauler "Ayirian I" launches from the outside landing pad and

'So why do we have to choose?
You ask, "So why do we have to choose?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Sorry, I have enough to do in 285 and I
believe we need more in 777 to bring in income and a salvaging station would
help support it or probably pay for itself."
'I'm confused.
You say, "I'm confused."
Morris says to Lily, "Why do you have so much to do in 285? You ahve the salvage
station."
Kim Saunders nods.
Damien says to you in a Malagasy accent, "Because we are not currently willing
to maintain three salvage processors."
A group of pilots is holding an intense meeting on the other side of the room.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We've been taking care of everything but
the beacon lately and it's not that we mind."
'We being.... who exactly?
You ask, "We being.... who exactly?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It's not gonna stay that way
though."
Morris says to Lily, "No. I did. I put up the salvage station when you didn't
even ask."
Damien says to you in a Malagasy accent, "That's basically what the vote is
about. Whether or not to keep the 285 salvage processor or to move it to 777."
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "Um you and me."
Morris says to Lily, "You volunteered to take care of the accelerator and the
roid station this last week. You took that on yourself. Even though I offered to
do it."
A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.
Lily says to Morris, "While we were on the trip right but we've done so since.
Anyway that's not what i'm saying."
Morris says to Lily, "It's supposed to be Kim's responsibility, which being a
trustee, I have no problem taking it upon myself."
Sakura Arakida looks at Zandria Marschaund thoughtfully.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yes, and I want clarity who does
what, and accept during times when someone is away, we will temporarily reassign
it. That was the plan."
Zandria loosa at Sakura thoughtfully.
"Who's in charge of the BAS?" Sakura Arakida glances at Melinda Michaels.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That's what the book says too."
Morris says to Lily, "Your responsibility, as assigned previously, is the
salvage station."
Zandria looks at Sakura Thoughtfully.
Morris says to Lily, "If you want to change that, it can be discussed."
Morris says to Lily, "But don't talk like you're doing all this on your own when
it's not even your job."
Morris says to Lily, "And no one asked you to do it."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I should've brought a change of
clothes, this is gonna take a while."
Caleb Davenport snickers at Nicolette Lawrence.
Sakura Arakida snickers at Nicolette Lawrence.
Sakura says to Nicolette in a Japanese accent, "I should of bought more sweet
coffee."
Lily says to Morris, "Prior to when we left, when anything went down out there,
people were always asking me. Again I don't mind. I'm just stating what is."
Morris Corlew removes a copy of "Temporary Station Information Booklet I" from a
metallic silver messenger bag.
You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.
Morris Corlew begins reading in a copy of "Temporary Station Information Booklet
I".
Lily says to Morris, "I have my own thank you."
Melinda glances around the room, "right so, the objectives have been discussed.
Testing is a good thing, just let people know so that they know what is
happening with their megacredits. Currently 285 is staying, unless we get some
other information. Now then," she grins, "continue with your grievances and
arguing."
Kim says to Lily, "Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your willingness to help.
But first you said you did not mind helping, but when the vote does not go your
way, you suddenly have enough to do. That makes no sense."
Morris says to Lily, "Yes, for awhile, Kim was away and unable to take care of
285. I started taking that place. She was away...she isn't, and I"m here too."
Morris Corlew puts a copy of "Temporary Station Information Booklet I" in a
metallic silver messenger bag.
Lily Kaise puts a sheet of yellow paper on a lacquered wooden bar.
Lily says to Morris, "I've said all that I care to say."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
light transport "Registered Merchant 551".
Melinda says to Lily, "If you have another idea about this new place, ops and
see that people are interested, do let me know."
'Ok, I'm really confused now. Who isn't willing to maintain three salvaging
stations?
You ask, "Ok, I'm really confused now. Who isn't willing to maintain three
salvaging stations?"
The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.
Morris says to Lily, "Ok. That's fine. But don't act like you have all this
responsibility at 285 and it's a burden when you don't have it at all...except
for just taking it upon yourself when the folks that are supposed to be doing it
are actually around to do it."
Melinda says to you in a Bedford accent, "It just isn't cost effective."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I've invested towards the new local
artifacting field. Anyone who wants it after the current stations go down adn
have it."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been
received at AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Angel's Flight". The organization has
earned 311,187.76 credits.
Kim says to Lily, "So. Choose. You maintain 1 or 2 stations in 285, salvage,
roid, or salvage and roid. Or beacon and accelerator. Then Morris and myself
will take care of the other 2."
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "The question was whether or not to
maintain a salvaging station in 285 or in 777 and they want 285."
Melinda says to you in a Bedford accent, "If my org founder says go for it, then
I don't care what y'all put up. We are discussing this stuff because we really
don't need 3 stations."
nod lily 'I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
You nod to Lily Kaise. "I'm just trying to understand what's going on."
Kim says to you in a New Bristol accent, "Investing money in 3 salvage stations
is not a reasonable possibility or option for all orgs. Most don't have the
credits to maintain it."
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "That is what's going on."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Melinda says to you in a Bedford accent, "Currently, I am trying to keep people
from arguing."
A group a table over have a conversation about pilots from other alliances while
rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.
Melinda Michaels grins.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Evenia Callseah quickly drains a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.
Evenia Callseah puts a mug in a small red trash can.
Sakura Arakida shakes her head. "Agreed. We don't need 3 stations. Salvage
stations..."
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 551" launches from the outside
landing pad and rises into space.
Tobias Hawthorne finishes off a warm butterscotch cookie.
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Okay, it's been a bit over an hour.
Does anybody have anything else, complains, whatever?"
Sakura Arakida orders a warm oatmeal raisin cookie.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Then we won't need another artifacting
field but Melinda you artifacted a lot locally didn't you? So where did you
obtain most of those?"
Damien Goss shakes his head at Melinda Michaels.
Sakura says to Melinda, "Just a question. Who deals with putting up the BAS?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Me."
Joel Kringle just arrived.
Joel Kringle sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.
Sakura says to Melinda, "May I take that off your hands? If I know what to get?
So that's one less thing, I've got a mod transport sitting around. Not being
used."
Melinda says to Lily in a Bedford accent, "Most of mine came from the bubble and
GMG."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Hmm ok."
Damien says to Sakura in a Malagasy accent, "Did you buy the informational
booklet?"
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "This is what I think."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I think."
Evenia says to Melinda, "I am also willing to help maintain anything, to take
the pressure off others."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Let me see what I think I think
here. I don't so much mind the new place being available as an option for
salvaging and artifacting. People like doing shipwrecks for whatever
reason--maybe it's just the variety, I don't know, but there was a lot of
discussion about that when we shut the last such place down. And I can
appreciate artifacters wanting another option to Battle of Mir. Those first 300
exploration are hard to get, and if you've set a few hours aside to try to do
some artifacting, and Mir's not producing for you, it's nice to have a choice,
even if things don't work out much better there. But if we're talking strictly
about salvage processors, I see no real reason why people can't bring back what
they pick up out there and take it to Orion, to help keep it filled up."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't know who has objected to
having a setup at 777 for artifacts."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "When I was pushing for 300
exploration I used battle of mir, and when I wasn't having luck there, I went to
134. So I can see 2 artifacting spots. Personally."
A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki jerks her limbs,
springing into the air briefly.
Melinda says to Lily in a Bedford accent, "I am not against an artifact field. I
am just trying to keep us from having an over-abundance of salvage stations,
roid stations and the ike. If we get to many, we will lose credits."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Salvage and artifacts from out
there can be taken to Orion easily enough."
Sakura says to Damien, "No I didn't didn't even know there was such a book.
Well, now I know."
Melinda Michaels nods to Nicolette Lawrence.
Morris Corlew removes a copy of "Temporary Station Information Booklet I" from a
metallic silver messenger bag.
Sakura Arakida finishes off a fresh raspberry pastry.
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Nicolette just basically said
what I was trying to say earlier. I like the variety of having the shipwrecks."
Morris Corlew gives a copy of "Temporary Station Information Booklet I" to
Sakura Arakida.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I salvaged a lot in 134 when I was a new
pilot and so rather than having to come all the way back as I frequently did at
least two loads, it was really nice to have the salvaging station there and I
also picked up artifacts as I found them while salvaging."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Okay, third option then is to nix
the salvage at 285, when we run ops, do them at 285 and drop the stuff at
Orion."
Sakura Arakida winces.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "By the way, I see very little use of the
salvaging station in 285. Perhaps a couple of transfers per day."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "I'd rather not spend 7 mill when I
want to do 4 or 5 loads in a day... I'd be losing money verses making it."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
light transport "Registered Merchant 551".
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "777 now has clear comms and recharge
and repair rearm. If that does not show that we are willing to help new people
with artifacting, I am not sure what would. And... dropping salvage station and
taking the op can back to orion is not a bad idea."
'I was just about to ask that. How much is the salvaging station at 285 being
used. Not counting salvage ops.
You say, "I was just about to ask that. How much is the salvaging station at 285
being used. Not counting salvage ops."
A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Otherwise what's the sense of having
higher grade grapples... if all we have is grade 30..."
A Tardick lizard named Athena flicks its tongue out from its perch on Joel
Kringle's shoulder.
Klaus Stein says in a German accent, "Accord missions."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "And now we're back to this argument,
that started when 134 was up..."
Melinda Michaels nods to Klaus Stein.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I would appreciate it that at least for
an experiment that we try a salvage station in 777 and if it's not used, then no
replacements."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I'd agree with that. It can't
hurt to at least try it."
'I think that sounds sensible.
You say, "I think that sounds sensible."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Fine then. I will agree to the
following."
Damien Goss asks in a Malagasy accent, "Why do we need an experiment? We had the
exact setup you are talking about before and we decided to shut it down?"
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I do think there's a point to
trying to keep the number of stations down though. Despite people's best
intentions, it's just a fact that the more of them there are, the more things
there are constantly going down, and people not being available when they
thought they would be, forgetting, getting bored with it, doing any one or more
of the infinite number of things that people do. And then there are all the
questions, well why isn't this up, who's responsible for that, somebody will
have to go get it right now or else the world will come to an end. Minimize the
number of stations and you minimize all that as well."
Sakura Arakida nods to Damien Goss.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup we did."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "That's why I'm looking for a place
within 5 light-years that has similar grade debris to 285 but more plentiful. I
know there is some turnoff based on there only being two fairly small pieces per
sector out there."
Lily says to Morris, "There are 4 shipwrecks per sector in 777."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "How much does a low end salvage
processor cost?"
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "2 megacredits I think."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Don't know the quantum is like 10
megacredits."
Morris says to Lily, "But significantly lower grade."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "This place is, 4 light-years closer
than 134."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But still 6 farther than 285
travel."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That is not a whole lot closer by."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "So let me ask this."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Nope."
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 551" launches from the outside
landing pad and rises into space.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I feel this is a valid question."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "No it's not."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "When new pilot James takes his cargo
hauler out there to salvage and runs into bad flow, who is going to go get him
when he runs out of charge?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "There is a charging station out there."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "He'd run out of charge in the rift if
the flow's shit though."
A group a table over have a conversation about pilots from other alliances while
rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.
Melinda Michaels nods.
Morris Corlew nods to Sakura Arakida.
Damien Goss nods. "Cause he can't exactly turn around mid trip if the flow is so
bad his ship dies."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "That's a big concern."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "And that's not fair to him."
Kim Saunders nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "6 hours is not a lot of charge."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Hmm let's see a Cargo hauler has what 6
hours? It's the same as a medium transport isn't it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, but we have the option of
sticking a feinstein on our medium transport, making it 12 hours."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Not sure."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Then when new pilot James falls
asleep in his ship and gets blown up by pirates because we couldn't get to him
fast enough, is that his fault and are we just going to call him stupid?"
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Keep it for artifactors... keep 285
for salvagers. we don't really need shipwrecks but that's my thought, we had the
same argument over 134."
Sakura says to Melinda, "No... at least, I wouldn't."
'That could happen if said pilot went out to 285 or came back from it too.
You say, "That could happen if said pilot went out to 285 or came back from it
too."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "If it's accessible, both can
use it. You can't stop people from going there to salvage. But salvage can be
taken to Orion once it's gathered and so can artifacts."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If a pilot who had been around for a
month fell asleep in space, yeah, I would probably say that was not a smart
thing to do, a real cadet deserves more consideration."
Melinda says to Lily, "Okay, I'll agree to this test. Get a low end processor
out there for now. Also get a toll with something really small. Just so that we
can hear how much this is being used."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Fair enough?"
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "That's true, but then if we end
up putting a toll on 777, that would get costly, quickly."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Which I haven't but yes that's true.
It's like with anything. A new pilot oculd run out of charge anywhere. Be
certain to inform them of the risks. Yes we've also gone to pick up more
experienced pilots as well so it happens but it's not a good reason not to have
these areas."
Sakura says to you in a Japanese accent, "A 6 minute trip 9 minute trip, 25
minute trip to 285 is better than the several hour trip to where ever."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Just stick a message beacon on the
salvage station there, or does the one in 285 have one of those?"
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Klave went out there earlier,
possibly thinking there was a salvage station he could drop at. If there had
been a toll, he would have been a sad, sad new pilot."
A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki spins webbing, gathering
it into a ball with her back feet, then eats it.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Personally you're flying farther for
not much gain..."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Can't put toll on it now, the
accelerator is already built."
-sakura It doesn't take several hours to get to 777.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It took us 8 minutes when the flow was
in our favor and about 40 minutes when it was not."
You say to Sakura, "It doesn't take several hours to get to 777."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "One of the concerns for 134 is that
it was a good ways out. I will admit to this being a little bit closer."
Sakura says to you in a Japanese accent, "I'm speaking hypothetically."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person

-sakura Ah, ok.
You say to Sakura, "Ah, ok."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "It took me 2 hours to get to 134 one
day."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "It took me 11.5 minutes in a capsule
assisted with the accelerator today."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It generally will require more time if a
beacon or accelerator goes down."
Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "On a bad day 9 lightyears can still
take an hour."
Melinda says to Lily, "Did you hear my suggestion?"
Morris says to Lily, "It took me over an hour to get out there to put the
recharge up."
Damien Goss nods to Kim Saunders.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "And nothing was down, there was no
charger out there, and in a light transport, I had to turn back around so I
didn't die."
nod mel 'I think your suggestion is fair though.
You nod to Melinda Michaels. "I think your suggestion is fair though."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "It took me an hour and a half
to get to 288 from 287 this morning to replace the out-of-comms asteroid
processor. Some days shit just happens."
Lily says to Melinda, "Nope as we were all talking over one another."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Melinda says to Lily, "Okay, I'll agree to this test. Get a low end processor
out there for now. Also get a toll with something really small. Just so that we
can hear how much this is being used."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Melinda says to Kim, "Low, no high expensive processor."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "What was really annoying was
that I had been in a storm that would've had my ETA to fifteen minutes, but I
came out of it and that turned into the hour and a half mentioned above. But
like I said, some days."
nod nicolette
You nod to Nicolette Lawrence.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not sure we can put the toll up just yet
but when we replace the accelerators we can."
Melinda says to Lily, "Like a million credit toll or something small like that."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Sure you can."
Lily Kaise nods.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "You can't put it once it's
already there, the top is on it, it is the way it is."
Kim says to Melinda, "I did not say anything yet about the type of processor,
are you reading my mind?"
Melinda says to Kim, "Probably."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But toll could mean someone goes out
there for artifacts, or salvage. So the toll out to there, could be
missleading."
Soraya Rhyz just arrived.

Kringle's shoulder.
Melinda says to Sakura, "Na, we want to know how much it will be used in
general."
Sakura Arakida nods.
Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "We'd know how much it was used for
salvage from drops to the low-end salvage processor station."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I didn't put one on initially because I
wanted others to try it initially."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I did consider it though."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Just make sure the message when the
salvage comes in indicates clearly enough where it is, like debris burning for
orion, and I think 285 is just reactor something something. Message beacon is
also mentioned in the name when the debris is brought in."
'We'll make the toll 1 EOS credit.
You say, "We'll make the toll 1 EOS credit."

You chuckle.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Okay, test this low end salvage
thing. If we just go by the ovtes though, 285 wins."
Lily Kaise laughs at you.
Soraya Rhyz orders a warm League-iced cookie.
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "I have a concern."
Rogue Romano glances around at her surroundings.
Melinda says to Damien, "Fair enough?"
Nicolette says to Melinda, "You know the kind of thing I'm a lot more concerned
about, and this isn't it. But I do think, again, that there don't need to be
salvage processors everywhere, people can hhaul stuff back home, the ship
doesn't move any slower because it's loaded down."
Melinda Michaels nods to Nicolette Lawrence. "Most of us agree with you."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's not the point. As I said some
want to salvage more than one load as I sure did."
Melinda says to Kim, "What's that?"
Nicolette Lawrence asks in a California accent, "So then go back?"
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "It'll still be there."
Sakura says to Nicolette in a Japanese accent, "But if someone wants to salvage
at 285. To do 4 or 5 loads, they're putting out 35 mill. I don't want to do that
just to haul back and forth. I'd be losing more money than I'd make."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If the toll is prohibitive one wouldn't
want to."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "35 mill just in tolls."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "How long until sayto melinda I'm less
concerned about having a processor up there to test than I am in the fact that
people are arbitrarily deciding to put stations up."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "For me, salvage station in 777 is
not necesary, but for a fair test, don't you need the same quality of salvage
processors to determine how it works?"
Rogue Romano finishes off a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Any thoughts?"
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Not necessarily."
Melinda says to Kim, "No because we are just determining if people are gonna use
it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I would say so and I'd rather we not use
a low level one."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have never worked with low level
salvage processors."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Not if you want to gage if
you want to know how much it will be used first."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But if it means none, then it is what we
get out there."
Melinda says to Damien, "I agree."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Put a toll to determine how many goes
out, put a salvage processor out there to see how many are going out there for
salvage."
Pari the small black winged felo stares curiously up at Morris Corlew.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been
received at AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Angel's Flight". The organization has
earned 393,312.07 credits.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "The payout is less on the small
processor, the points are the same."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Low end salvage station for the
test."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Guys, the toll only works on the
accelerator? Which was put up today?"
Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Is there a way to check
these...metrics, or do we just have to depend on noticing them when various org
members are awake and in comms?"
Melinda says to Morris, "Notice is it."
Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Okay, I obviously drifted off. Someone
give me a quick rundown."
Soraya Rhyz takes a bite of a warm League-iced cookie.
Nicolette Lawrence sighs.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "We're still here. That's the
rundown."
Lily says to Morris, "Look at the income reports from the organization center."
Rogue Romano nods to Nicolette Lawrence.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "It doesn't itemize by station."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That does not show which debris was
brought in where, unfortunately."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Just by type."
"That works." Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "I just got access to that...so
not used to having it."
Melinda says to Rogue in a Bedford accent, "We are discussing the 40 to 60 grade
roids at 4 light-years travel or grade 30 shipwrecks at 10 light-years travel.
Which do you like?"
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Not everyone can do that. That's only
a trusty thing."
Lily Kaise nods to Morris Corlew.
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
light transport "Registered Merchant 551".
Joel Kringle grins at Soraya Rhyz.
Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I think everybody should have
their own org and be their own trustee. Sometimes."
Damien Goss asks in a Malagasy accent, "The salvage processor in 285 has an AEU
core, yes?"
nod damein
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
I don't see that here.
Evenia Callseah nods.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Then I stop thinking that and
go do something else."
nod damien
You nod to Damien Goss.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Put a League core on the test processor
in 777. That's how we'll tell them apart."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "It still basically relies on
someone being up 24/7 or splitting shifts to somehow write it all down, if the
income reports don't tell us where it's from."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We put those on because we can keep
track in our range office as well as since we were maintaining it, would know
when it was aobut to go offline if we hadn't checked the range office."
Nicolette says to Morris, "You're usually up 24/7."
Melinda says to Rogue in a Bedford accent, "Do you prefer either?"
"Is he?" Kim Saunders laughs.
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "So am I, almost."
Morris says to Nicolette, "Hardly."
Damien Goss nods to Lily Kaise.
Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Well, I don't salvage often, only for
accord mostly. But I never traveled so far to salvage before. But the concern is
definitely for the new comers."
Morris says to Nicolette, "It's more a joke."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "I monitor org notifications very
closely."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I do too, but I can't if I'm
sleeping. Which I should do more than I do."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Okay, so test this salvage station."
A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki taps her claws on the
floor.
Evenia Callseah nods. "As do I."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "That's done."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "So."
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 551" launches from the outside
landing pad and rises into space.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "If we're going to put a league core on
it to tell the difference per notifications, who would like to contribute the
core."
You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "That'll be good for another
hour or two of discussion."
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Even better, get a
fringe core."
Damien Goss grins at Nicolette Lawrence.
chuckle nicolette
You chuckle at Nicolette Lawrence.
Evenia Callseah grins at Nicolette Lawrence.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Unless I contribute it personally,
it wouldn't be me, because if I purchase it for Seekers, it'd be another AEU."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Cats will get something so that the
vassals can be in on it. Let Joel get the core."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "If it's a cost thing I'll do
it."
Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well we put parts on depending on which
organizations can afford them as well."
Morris says to Melinda, "May I request we put on the breeder though, so we get
something out of it considering the other station that's out there is ours?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So cores, tops and the stealth sheaths
are best suted for smeller orgs and Seas put them on this time."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Smaller that is."
Melinda says to Morris, "Get the salvage thing. Cats will get the battery so
that all vassals will be able to get in."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "It does not matter what we put on,
as long as it's at least one part. Do you need the breeder for a basic salvage
processor?"
Morris says to Melinda, "Ok."
A Tardick lizard named Athena, perched on Joel Kringle's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "And just so everyone knows."
Lily says to Melinda, "So what aprt does seas put on then?"
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "A basic salvage processor and unmanned
pickup on a large battery lasts about a month."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Part that is."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Put a message beacon top, to warn
pilots to be safe in space and how to get back home."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We'll get a large battery then."
You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "After this, I'd love to terrorize
GMG for a bit, but then again that depends if you're up for it or not."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "A month should be sufficient testing
time."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Just so you know, I am personally
not for all this. But, out of fairness, I'll go with the test."
Joel Kringle grins.
Damien Goss shrugs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok well Rune had the top before and so
just let us know what we can do here as Seas would appreciate participating."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Ok."
Melinda says to Lily, "You are putting this up. This is your baby."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Agreed with mel. It seems like 134
all over again. As far as salvage goes."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Cats battery."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Seas stealth."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Rune message beacon."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The only difference is, this station
is closer."
A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the
steaming beverage.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Surfers core."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Seekers processor."
Morris Corlew nods to Sakura Arakida. "3 light-years difference."
Sakura says to Melinda, "By a small bit."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
Lily says to Morris, "Ok put that on Herding Cats."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "And I already have a wormhole if we want
to use it from long ago."
Morris says to Lily, "Yep."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Long long ago."
Melinda says to Sakura, "But people can't say I wasn't trying to be fair."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I have the others."
-damien Long long ago in a land far far away?
You say to Damien, "Long long ago in a land far far away?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Right, now real q uick."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Think it's time zandria and I get out
of here... I'm getting kind of dizzy."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "This thing will have to be
about twelve-sided for everybody to be able to get in on it."
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "From about 3 years ago."
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Um, quick?"
Sakura says to Zandria in a Japanese accent, "I know a good place for dinner.
Want to go?"
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "There's not a big-enough power
source."
Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.
Nicolette Lawrence laughs.
Zandria says to Sakura, "Sure."
Melinda says to Damien, "Your concern, have at it before we finish."
Kim Saunders giggles. "I think we will get everyone in, just..."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
light transport "Registered Merchant 551".
Damien says to Melinda, "It's been addressed."
Sakura Arakida stands up from a cushy booth seat.
A well-dressed man speaks in hushed tones to a nearby pilot and hands him a
small credit chip.
Sakura Arakida pulls Zandria Marschaund towards her.
Soraya Rhyz takes a bite of a warm League-iced cookie.
Sakura Arakida exclaims in a Japanese accent, "Dinner time for us!"
Melinda says to Damien, "You've no added point to drill home?"
Sakura Arakida waves.
Sakura Arakida's group trudges out.
Joel Kringle grins.
Nicolette Lawrence yawns.
Morris says to Lily, "I'll get that on your ship in a few minutes."
Damien Goss shakes his head at Melinda Michaels. "You made it quite clear in the
beginning about building without notice."
Morris Corlew crumples up his sheet of green paper and throws it in a nearby
garbage can.
Melinda says to Damien, "Okay, anything else for you then?"
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "So rune does the message beacon,
right?"
Melinda Michaels nods to Rogue Romano.
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "Goes on Lily's ship?"
Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Romano.
Damien Goss shakes his head at Melinda Michaels.
Klaus Stein asks in a German accent, "I lost track of things towards the end,
but do you need any specific parts from morning star?"
Nicolette Lawrence asks in a California accent, "Do we need to spend a few hours
discussing the exact wording of the message?"
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "Will I need a key to it or no?"
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person Accord gemini "Shattered Souls" launches from the outside landing pad
and rises into space.
Joel says to Rogue, "Probably not."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Yes she would."
Lily says to Rogue, "There are regular tops on Segue but i'm not sure if thee is
a messaging top so just check and put one on please if you can?"
Joel says to Rogue, "I see ships I have no keys for come up to load things on
all the time."
Damien Goss asks in a Malagasy accent, "So do we want to get the wormhole module
I have from long long ago?"
Morris says to Joel, "That's because they're in your alliance."
Klaus Stein says in a German accent, "Doesn't necessarily mean it'll let you
load stuff on them."
Lily says to Joel, "You're covered."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "She can put it on segway."
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 551" launches from the outside
landing pad and rises into space.
Nicolette says to Joel, "It's alliance-based. If you're not in theirs or vice
versa, you can't do it."
Melinda says to Klaus, "We'll get something from all of us."
Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I'll check segway then."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Sweet."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Without a key."
Klaus Stein nods to Melinda Michaels.
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "You learn something
everyday."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Good."
Nicolette says to Joel, "You need to."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "And hopefully we won't have to do
this again for awhile."
Nicolette Lawrence nods.
Nicolette Lawrence laughs.
Kim says to Klaus, "You said something else, about megacredit conversion? And
didn't know what that is?"
Joel Kringle smirks at Nicolette Lawrence.
Morris Corlew stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.
Klaus Stein says in a German accent, "I mean I guess it's for converting credits
to megacredits."
Kim Saunders nods. "It is."
Melinda Michaels nods to Klaus Stein. "You can now convert."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Ok, let me run and do this,
because I've got things going that are on a time limit."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Well done boss."
Morris Corlew glances down at his watch momentarily.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "I think an organization needs what 3000
Command though before they can convert credits to megacredits?"
Klaus Stein asks in a German accent, "What's the conversion rate?"
Soraya Rhyz stretches.
You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by
loud swearing.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's
neck.
A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's unblinking eyes stare
into the middle distance.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "1500, 5 million."
Nicolette nods to the landing pad.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Standard is 5 milion credits for 1
megacredit. And then as your org gets more points, it will be 4 milion and
something, and so on."
Klaus Stein nods.
Damien Goss stands up from a cushy booth seat.
Soraya Rhyz takes a bite of a warm League-iced cookie.
Klaus Stein says in a German accent, "Right."
Damien Goss strides out.
Lily says to Klaus, "Depending on the organizaitons unity, it will range to
about 5 million or less."
Joel Kringle pats Klaus Stein on the back. "Good on you bruh."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Those guys out there are
stealing all my idea."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Gonna get a battery."
Melinda Michaels just went into the stairway to the garage.
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the void
piercer "Millennium Star" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into
space.
Morris Corlew orders a fresh apple pastry.

inventory. How many of those message beacons is needed?"
Pari the small black winged felo stares curiously up at Joel Kringle.
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person medium transport "Red Tape Is No Joke" launches from the outside
landing pad and rises into space.
Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Er, segway."
Joel Kringle grins at Pari the small black winged felo.
Klaus Stein walks out.
Evenia says to Rogue, "Just the one."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "For this particular station, just
1."
Caleb Davenport orders a fresh peach pastry.
Rogue Romano nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't know about anything else."
Caleb Davenport takes a bite of a fresh peach pastry.
Lily says to Rogue, "Probably just 1 for now. We'll need one in a couple of
weeks."
Caleb Davenport puts on a bulky asteroid supply cannon.
Caleb Davenport takes a bite of a fresh peach pastry.
Rogue Romano nods.

Rogue Romano stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.
Nicolette Lawrence stretches.
Joel Kringle stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.
Joel Kringle waves.
Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Alright, y'all take care."
Joel Kringle just went into the stairway to the garage.
Rogue Romano waves.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well a little less than that but I know
you all don't have many megacredits and not sure about cash so go easy."
Rogue Romano slinks out.
Evenia yawns behind her hand.
Caleb Davenport stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.
Kim says to Lily, "Stay a moment?"
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Well. I have nothing to do, so
I'm gonna go do it."
Caleb Davenport says in a faintly Cajun accent, "Wake up evil one."
Nicolette Lawrence sharply salutes herself, then returns the salute in a proper
manner, and then that salute in turn. This continues for some time.
Nicolette Lawrence walks out.
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
vostok-class capsule "Knight Of The Rift" launches from the outside landing pad
and rises into space.
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Will work on that."
Lily Kaise nods.
Caleb Davenport walks out.
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person Accord gemini "Driftwood" launches from the outside landing pad and
rises into space.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "So, which of the 285 are going to do
in the future? Salvage and roid, or do you prefer something else, or just
salvage?"
Soraya Rhyz sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!" launches from the
outside landing pad and rises into space.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It doesn't matter. We'll do anything or
I'll do anything i'm asked to do."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
light transport "Registered Merchant 551".
Evenia says to Kim, "Also, if you like, since there's four things out there, I'm
more than willing to throw in a hand where I can, to take pressure off people."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, then you and Shule talk it
over, pick 1 or 2, and let me and morris know so we can take proper
responsibility for the others."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Hah, I don't have a key."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "To what?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok will do."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "We should also talk soon about your
vasselization request, but probably not tonight."
Soraya Rhyz says into her silvery gray metachannel FTL communicator, "Your
head's?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Probably the ship we're loading
all this on."
Lily says to Kim, "I hadn't intended to offer vassalizaiton to you at this
point."
Tobias Hawthorne scrambles to his feet.
Tobias Hawthorne just went into the stairway to the garage.
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Well that old wormhole module is
up in space, salvage it at will."
Lily says to an alliance information assistant in a New Earth accent, "Believe
we need considerably more megacredits to afford 25 percent of your expenses."
Pari the small black winged felo rubs up against a lacquered wooden bar, purring
softly.
Lily says to Kim, "I believe we need considerably more megacredits to afford 25

Lily says to Kim, "Besides Shule says that you were going to deny it anyway so
it's a moot point now isn't it?"
The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the
two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 551" launches from the outside
landing pad and rises into space.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "This is why I suggested you do not
vasselize for 50 percent. But, I did not know your changed your mind on the
vasselization."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lily, the processor is aboard.
So is Joel's part."
Damien Goss just arrived.
You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.
Damien Goss glances down at his expensive platinum watch with diamond accents
momentarily.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I would like to yes but I did a
little analysis and I felt that 25 percent is best but we'd need a bigger pot of
megacredits though."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Shule and myself had a confidential
conversation during the time he was still a Starseekers trustee, in which I
expressed some concerns, and he asked me to reconsider a few things. I did not
finish my reconsidering."
Damien Goss removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into
a light metallic gray flightbag.
Lily Kaise nods to Kim Saunders.
Damien Goss says to Evenia in a Malagasy accent, "I'll call you on the org
channel when I head out to replace 001."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the
vostok-class capsule "Knight Of The Rift".
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I may have opinions, but I tend to
listen to what advice people give me."
Evenia says to Damien Goss, "Sure thing. How long, in theory?"
A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the
steaming beverage.
Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Two, maybe three hours I think."
Joel Kringle just arrived.
Evenia Callseah nods to Damien Goss.
Evenia says to Damien, "That's cool."
Damien Goss nods.
Lily says to Kim, "Well you know how business is. Everyone involved doesn't have
to be the best of friends but if the arrangement is beneficial to all parties,
then why not."
Damien says to Joel Kringle, "Beers?"
You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.
Joel Kringle beams.
Evenia says to Damien, "I'm so in, if you guys are still gunna. I could use 2 or
six."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Yes! Lets."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, I will gladly discuss that
with you at some point, but I do not think here and now is a good idea."
Damien Goss asks in a Malagasy accent, "Let's go. Where to?"
Joel Kringle asks in a southern California accent, "Tony's?"
Evenia Callseah stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.
Damien Goss holds Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into his group.

Kim Saunders glances down at her expensive silver watch with diamond accents
momentarily.

sometime yet before I want to consider offering to you. I have reservations too
about what has gone on before with other trustees and i'll leave it at that for
now."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Oh well, I guess half an hour to
unwind is not a bad idea."
Kim Saunders stands up from a cushy booth seat.
Kim Saunders joins Joel Kringle's group.
Joel Kringle cheers for Kim Saunders! "It is now officially a party."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Later all."
Joel Kringle's group strides out.
Kulta the little black CatBot trots happily after Evenia Callseah with a quiet
hiss of hydraulics.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Zro Des
Cartes to AFW Command: CHK SGNL <END>"

forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits,

palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

Salvage Processing station now available in Artifact Beacon Alpha 777 - Final
Resting Place of New Earth 40th
There is now a basic salvage processor up in Alpha 777. There are grade 20 to 40
shipwrecks and often sectors yield medium-sized shipwrecks so there may likely
be an occasional large shipwreck available
We need your assessments of this area to determine whether or not we will
continue to support temporary stations in this field. Please drop a note to
either shule Elemmire or myself with your observations, suggestions or
otherwise. The Salvage Processor has around 26 days of power remaining.
Therefore, this should provide ample time to try this new area.
Remember to travel from B-24 to Alpha 777 and from the B-24 sector itself or
your travel time will likely be affected. To return, travel to Alpha 776 and
then East to the next sector which is B-24.
Fly safely! happy artifacting and salvaging.
