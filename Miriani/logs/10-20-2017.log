The walls of this cramped little shop are painted a deep hunter green, and the floors are done in polished white linoleum tiles that gleam under the bright fluorescent lights set into the ceiling. Boxes of supplies have been stacked against the walls, and an elderly man sits behind a long wooden counter, his heavily lined faced arranged into a warm smile. Next to a glass panel in the counter that houses a glowing computer terminal is a holographic projection of a starship's engine. Each time a person approaches the display, the image flickers and transforms into a menu that provides information on the available upgrades.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Porpoise" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

02:42 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Porpoise, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:42 The five-person transverser "Defying Gravity" has left the sector.

02:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:43 (Outreach; Observation Room) The one-person junker "Interplanetary Postal Service 6302" has exited from Jumpgate to Central Jumpgate Hub.

02:43 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

02:43 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:43 The ship must be in space to do that.

02:43 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:43 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

02:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:43 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

02:43

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (11, 11, 5)

02:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:43 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:43 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Porpoise. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

02:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

So, I noticed something really odd, and I am wondering how it works involving docking bays.
let's take a gunship, for example. it has a docking bay space of 10, yet it's docking bay can hold 9.9 units of starship mass. With that in mind, a lot of stuff goes into making a starship, from the control boards, weapons, sensors, computer, batteries, wiring, rooms, life support, etc. So, how is it then, that a starship that has a docking bay's total mass is made up of over 99 percent docking bay space? Hopefully this makes some sense, if not I shall try to clarify.

I don't know if this has come up before, it probibly has, but if so, I never saw it. But what is even the point of pulse weapons now? Other than just to be 4 conveniant damage absorbers that you get at higher point levels. How many people consider them to be useful? How many people consider them to be just fun things to shoot each other with? According to the raven, it seems like there was once a time when pulse weapons actually did something. Disarminant pulses kept you from shooting, sensor interruption pulses kept you from seeing, immobilization pulses kept you from jumping, and the CDP does what it still does. Now they seem to just do small bits of damage that is negligible compared to the time it takes them to recharge. So what happened? Why did it change, and if it is to stay like this, is there any reason to having them besides being armor without being armor?

While looking at one of the beta channel history pages, there was some discussion about this as I seem to recall. I think the main thing from them becoming more powerful is the fact that they are basically auto locking. There were a few other issues, too, but I think the auto locking one might be the greatest.
I would definitely like to see them become more strategic. That is to say, harder to hit somebody with, but effects which are at least more debilitating than they are now.

Could that not be easilly be fixed by making them function like normal weapons, meaning you have to physically target them, or make it to where if the target is not at the location where you originally locked on, the weapon misses?

I agree with Bert. they should do something other than doing minor damage.
while we are on the topic of upgrades. we should get more upgrades related to pulse weaponry. or some technology that fires a beam of light at stars to gather data about specific star types, a, b, f, g etc
it would help enhance the roleplay reasons for why the pulses were there in the first place.

I'm not sure how I feel about the changes concerning stunning on capital planets. I can understand not being able to stun on a landing pad, but why the rest of the planet? It would be nice if the security only works against people that are not a part of that alliance. also, can we get a device that allows us to use our weapons and droids within our ships on those landing pads? I don't know why or who thought it was a great idea for these changes, but I feel that it's kind of silly that I can't heal someone on the landing pad or even within my ship if I'm landed. There needs to be some dialog between the hosts and the serious players that play this game. Not people who just want to hold hands and read the bible. If the problem is people were making the game a shitty environmen via stunning and trying to make up for their lack of man hood OOC, then lets figure out some roleplay methods of fixing it.

I half agree with your message. And here is why.
healing someone? Ok, that should be possible. I would think that the frequency of a heal shot would not be the same as a stun shot. There for, the jamming fields would not block that.
Stunning someone inside your own ship, it's a two way street there. For one, it would make ship theft super easy again, get in to there group some way, get on the ship, and then boom. But on the other, it also still makes ship theft easy, because, untill you get off the planet, no one can stun you. So perhaps a comprimise has to be made, like only possible on purple alert.
I also think the gloves should come off if weapons are being used against alliances at war, now that you mention it.
The problem was not only that people were making the game shitty, but it was also the fact, and may still be the fact, that if the game was going to be taken seriously as a game where people roleplayed, and not just with there friends, something had to be done about people feeling like any RP they did in public areas could easilly be interrupted by a stun happy person, as 1 shot would end everything.

it won't make ship theft easy because you are able to choose whether or not someone can follow you. OOCly I could follow someone into their house with or without their permission. On Miriani you currently have group options, so that is no longer the case.

There is still a way. It is a way I will not gleefully broadcast to everyone in the game, but it is still possible. Only just, but possible. However for the most part, I do see your point.

Well as I said, I am half and half. You should still at least be able to remove stuntime from someone, or better yet, have medical bays do it. And before the whole, it's a balance issue, starts up, have someone stun you and then you go try and walk to a medical bay. Unless you have another player's help, you ain't doing it.

Have your party in your starship, apartment or house the way players have always done. Right now I don't see anyone interacting outside of their starship or homes. We have a beautiful station in sector 33 that is made for hanging out at, i don't see anyone taking advantage of it. I would agree with you if players would actually socialize outside of their safety zones.

Not often I disagree with Matt, but based on the current environment, I like the changes. I do think that perhaps it should be changed to let people heal there, but Miriani isn't the place it use to be.

I wish players would interact outside of their control room. I can't count how many times I have tried to get people to meet up in lounges, bars and that hotel place that apparently is never going to be finished with the casinos and such, but the problem isn't the way the game is, it's the playerbase. I hate to say that, but it's true.

personally, I wonder how much of it is because of past experiences. I'm not saying the player base is not at fault, but I mean, look at all the shit that got heeped on us in the past 3 years. I personally know many who these changes came too late for, and won't return. I was almost one of them myself. But it's not all on the hosts and the changes in the game. Players need to take initiative just as the hosts did.

As a player that has been on here for over nine years, I beg to differ that it has always been lousy. As a player that went from being chased after only being in the game two days with a newbie tag, to one that pretty much owned this galaxy, I can speak from both sides of the fence. If players have a bounty from a certain alliance, make the alliances go after them for real. Not this weak bounty hunter stuff. if they go to the capital sector that they have a bounty from, have that long range kick on on their starship. If they land on the planet if they aren't already denied, have the spaceport security run a train on them and send them to their capital planet in a pod without their ship. There are ways to discourage trolling. If they don't like the bounty, have them pay the fine. Either way they are being punished. We used to have rules and class with piracy back in the day. Today it is just trolling. Don't break the game, break the players and their pockets.

some players can afford this, and others can not.
This should just stay the same way.
I still think it should become part of alliance wars and not everyday stuff.
if I want to meet a newbie and help them out I don't want to suddenly get taken hostage and said, oh now I am going to fuck up your day nad wreck your helping with this newbie by capturing you, and removing all possibility of enjoying the game.

The bounty system is kind of broken anyway, because it is based on a ship system. i have seen pirates blow up ships with fighters, hell, even a cargo hauler, which, that was kind of funny, but anyway, just to avoid having the bounty put on the main ship. And if they do have a bounty on a big ship, they leave it landed and never launch it again. That is, untill they get the bounty up to high, then they probibly just do the same thing with private stations.

So the questoin is, is it the system or the players that are broken? One would think you would have enough sense to not attack a player if they are showing newbies how to play the game. The above suggestions would fix the problems at hand.

The system needed to be put in though because of the players, or more over, because of the players who were trolling senslessly and because people were feeling unable to play the game, let alone RP. You might not be able to stun, but you can still reck someone's day by recking their starship. For anyone who has an issue with that, buy a sim and train up.

You apparently have never blown up a starship before. Anyways, just blowing up starships isn't consider as piracy. It's just another form of trolling. If this was five years ago trust me, you would be begging to be stunned over my starship entering the sector. The system is broken now and it's not going to fix the trolls.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cann
22:11 ot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access to the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

You can go south and out.

22:13 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:13 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

22:13 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:13 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

22:13 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:13 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

22:13 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:13 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:13 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:14 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 6, 1."

22:14 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:14 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:14 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:14 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:14 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:14 You can't power down the starship in space.

22:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:14 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:14 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cann
22:20 ot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access to the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access t
23:41 o the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub] (indoors)
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities.
