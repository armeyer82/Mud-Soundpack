02:22:17 You say, "Yeah."

02:22:27 You ask, "I'm wondering if she actually sent it?"

02:24:09 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:24:11 You say, "I know."

02:24:19 You say, "I'm not happy."

02:24:21 Lily Kaise stomps on the ground!

02:24:29 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Lily Kaise yells, "That is pure bullshit Best!"

02:24:53 Lily Kaise says, "We don't agree."

02:25:29 Lily Kaise says, "Of course I wouldn't have done this in a public place. Ii just had to do it somewhere."

02:25:35 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:25:38 You say, "Yeah, I know."

02:26:36 Lily Kaise says, "I'm starting to htink there is something wrong with that man."

04:40:32 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

04:47:22 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

04:47:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.

You can go east, south, and down.

04:57:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

04:57:32 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:57:33 You may not leave the airlock until its environment matches that of the ship.

04:57:35 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

04:57:37 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

04:57:39 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

04:57:44 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

04:57:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

04:57:46 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

04:57:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:57:48  You are wearing a gold spacesuit helmet, a black spacesuit top with a red star on the right shoulder, a pair of black spacesuit gloves with a gold stripe around each cuff, a black spacesuit bottom with a red stripe down the outside of each leg, and a pair of black spacesuit boots with a gold stripe down each side. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of white cotton briefs, and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.

04:57:48 You are carrying a starship requisition application in your right hand.

04:57:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:57:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:57:53 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

04:57:53 
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?

04:58:00 The ship is already moving.

04:58:01 The ship is already moving.

04:58:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:58:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:58:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:58:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:58:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:58:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:58:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:58:10 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:58:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:58:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:58:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:58:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:58:15 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:58:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

04:58:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:58:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:58:30 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Xi-6" has landed on the planet New Earth.

04:58:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:58:33 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:58:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:58:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:58:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:58:48 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

04:58:51 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:58:51 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:58:52 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

04:58:52 You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:58:54 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:18:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

14:18:50 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:18:53  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

14:19:02 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:19:02 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

14:19:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:19:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:19:04 I don't understand that.

14:19:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:19:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:19:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:19:21 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

14:19:23 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 643" has landed on the planet New Earth.

14:19:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:19:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

14:19:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:19:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:19:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:19:37 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: (6_L'YD#^#gM8i0Z?+M?o#h*N#'\5cRU5Qd]L!nY

14:19:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:19:48 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:19:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

14:22:37 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:22:47 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 643" has jumped out of the sector.

14:23:03 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:23:04 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:23:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:23:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:23:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:23:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:23:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:52:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Now I'm really bored."

14:52:29 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Keep going on, it'll get better."

14:52:52 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It is a lie and a trap."

14:53:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes but existence is a lie, and free will is a trap, and the trick is nondesire and ecstatic being. Or was that ecstatic nondesire and nonbeing. Anyway, it's something like that."

14:54:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Was this legendary Reets person any easier to understand?"

14:55:38 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "This poacher drone is too easy to understand."

15:03:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What is it with pilots falling asleep on the job these days."

15:03:38 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'll admit it. It's my nonslavery to that nonnecessary stimulant coffee."

15:03:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Coffee is god."

15:04:16 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So many keep assuring me."

15:04:27 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's fact."

15:04:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So the believers all attest."

You can go up.

16:43:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

16:43:01 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:43:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:43:02 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:43:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:43:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:43:03 I don't understand that.

16:43:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:43:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:43:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:43:14 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican" has jumped into the sector.

16:43:17 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Dalmatian Pelican! Welcome to home space!"

16:43:20 The ship is already moving.

16:43:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:43:21 Which sector did you mean?

16:43:21 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

16:43:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:43:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

16:43:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43:28 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Clear."

16:43:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43:31 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: x;x5$J1|bm#wJA0GGlZB[aQB.-Aa;[PcW?&}7~<!
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43:31 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

16:43:32 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

16:43:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43:36 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Jump sequence aborted."
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Artifact Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:43:37 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

16:43:38 Via general sector communication, Artifact Alpha transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Green Belt Formation!"

16:43:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:43:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:43:46 [Tactical Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Heh I guess they jumped."

16:43:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43:50 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:43:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43:55 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:43:57 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

16:44:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

16:44:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:44:14 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican" has landed on the planet New Earth.

16:44:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:44:21 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:44:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:44:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:44:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:44:41 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:44:41 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:44:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:45:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well that's disappointing. Not being able to do anything without Eli, that is."

16:45:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just hope everyone knows we're not all gung ho about leaving the accord."

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and
16:46:06  negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

17:39:47 You can't go that way.

17:39:50 Board what?

17:39:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

17:39:54 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

17:39:56 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

17:39:56 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:40:51 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

17:40:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:40:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:40:53 I don't understand that.

17:40:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:41:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:41:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:41:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:41:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:41:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:41:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

17:41:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:41:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:41:27 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

17:41:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:41:28 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:41:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

17:41:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:41:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:41:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:41:33 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:41:54 You are carrying nothing.

17:41:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:41:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:42:08 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

17:42:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:42:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:42:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:42:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Woo, clipper."

17:42:11 You scramble to your feet.

17:42:11 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

17:42:12 You exit the ship.
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person light transport "Dreamstar" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

17:42:15 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

17:42:15 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Bryan Stout, Nathaniel Owens, and Ryo Stel are standing here.
You can go out.

17:42:16 Ryo Stel waves.

17:42:19 Bryan Stout waves.

17:42:19 You wave.

17:42:21 Ryo Stel

17:42:21 He appears to be 30 years old. He is about six feet and zero inches tall and has fair skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has broad shoulders and a muscular chest. His face is round and boyish, with a small nose and sharp chin. His lips are full and pale and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, his eyes are pale blue and almond-shaped. His chin-length, wispy hair is white and neatly combed. He has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 He is wearing a pearl gray canvas jacket, a gray heather cotton tee, a sleek silver watch with diamond accents, a skinny mahogany leather belt, a pair of slim light blue jeans, and a pair of washed white canvas sneakers. He is also wearing a smoky blue canvas satchel and a pearl gray flip einrophone in a gray leather phone holster. His head, face, both eyes, neck, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

17:42:29 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the vostok-class capsule "Capsicum".

17:42:33 Ted Warburton just arrived.

17:42:35 Ted Warburton waves.

17:42:38 Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

17:42:39 Nathaniel Owens takes Ryo Stel into his group.

17:42:41 Nathaniel Owens takes you into his group.

17:42:41 You say, "Hi all."

17:42:42 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:42:43 Ryo Stel smiles. "Hi I'm ryo, but my friends call me ryo, you can call me ryo, everyone does."

17:42:43 Nathaniel Owens takes Ted Warburton into his group.

17:42:46 Nathaniel Owens takes Bryan Stout into his group.

17:42:47 Ted Warburton says, "Hey."

17:42:54 Bryan Stout grins at Ryo Stel.

17:42:58 Nathaniel Owens says, "Hi."

17:43:00 Bryan Stout says, "Yo."

17:43:00 Ted Warburton says, "Hi Rye."

17:43:16 Bryan Stout removes Bryan Stout's workbench from a black canvas backpack.

17:43:17 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Ready?"

17:43:19 Bryan Stout puts Bryan Stout's workbench in a black canvas backpack.

17:43:43 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Need to get beacons."

17:43:44 Ted Warburton walks in from the south.

17:43:46 Ted Warburton walks down.

17:43:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:43:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:43:58 [Starship "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha"; Weapons Room Three]

17:43:58 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You can go south and down.

17:44:02 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:44:03 Weapons status:

17:44:03 
Chaingun turrets: 16 out of 16 functioning.
Chaingun turrets under control of this weapons room: 6 out of 6 functioning.

17:44:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:44:27 Ted Warburton walks south.

17:44:32 You peer south...

17:44:32 
[Starship "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
Bryan Stout is standing here.
You can go north and south.

17:44:38 Ted Warburton walks in from the south.

17:44:39 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Who is on eng?"

17:44:39 Ted Warburton walks down.

17:44:42 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Me."

17:44:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:44:47 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Cool."

17:44:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:44:55 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was just checking ammo, we're good."

17:44:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:46:32 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ready?"

17:46:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:46:38 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Of course not."

17:46:39 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Steady."

17:46:43 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why would I ever be ready?"

17:46:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:46:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:46:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:46:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:47:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:47:10 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "No, I don't know what to do in this weapon room."

17:47:18 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Haha, nor me."

17:47:22 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Press the butons that make things die."

17:47:29 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Buttons."

17:47:30 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:47:31 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he screams!

17:47:43 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I like pushing buttons."

17:47:50 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "YOU DIDN'T TELL ME NOT TO FIRE AT MYSELF!"

17:47:52 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:48:09 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "We didn't tell you that on purpose, Ted."

17:48:12 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:48:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:48:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:48:30 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:48:31 You chuckle into the PA microphone.

17:48:32 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ouch, you horrible, horrible people."

17:48:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:48:50 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

17:48:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:48:56 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I am not a horrible people. I've never even won that game."

17:48:57 Ryo Stel's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wooh it's a gunship full of amusing men. I'm now going to be amused over here."

17:49:08 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nor have I as it goes."

17:49:09 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I did."

17:49:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:49:17 Ryo Stel's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shule is a horrible horrible horrible little brat."

17:49:21 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nate, you are officially a horrible people then."

17:49:24 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right, after this, we're off to the lounge for a game of hp."

17:49:27 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I am innocent."

17:49:30 Ryo Stel's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Fine with me."

17:49:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Always innocent."

17:49:41 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

17:49:41 You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

17:49:42 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Forever innocent."

17:49:58 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is that what Lily says too? Oh, wait."

17:49:59 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

17:50:08 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Of course it is."

17:50:14 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Haha."

17:50:29 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

17:50:42 There are no other ships in the sector.

17:50:56 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Go yellow or something so I can tell if we get a squire?"

17:50:59 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

17:51:05 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

17:51:05 A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

17:51:08 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

17:51:12 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Cool."

17:51:26 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gives us all chance to look, if we can wait for you to move, or for red."

17:52:17 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Come on."

18:07:30 You peer out...

18:07:30 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The five-person strike gunboat "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

18:28:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Yay all by my self, only got hit once, I just flew a high gunship beacon! It was easy."

18:29:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Beacons are not easy."

18:29:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nor are they fun."

18:29:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I'm allowed to enjoy my work. Therefore flying was fun. And I found that beacon to be easy for a high."

18:31:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, my view on that is, beacons are serious work. Everything we do to fight off common enemies is. But no one ever said we couldn't have fun at it while we work, and congratulations on flying your gunship beacon, Ryo."

18:31:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Good job, Ryo. And I agree, beacons are fun."

18:31:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Exactly kim."

18:32:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But you didn't get a rapid. They can be a pain."

18:33:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "If I did I would of just kept moving instead of sitting still waiting for a lock."

18:34:39 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "So question. Even though fighting outsiders is serious work. Am I the only one who finds flying beacons fun?"

18:35:01 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I like flying beacons."

18:35:05 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "No. I find it fun."

18:35:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I hate it, but I'm happy to gun, and happier to eng."

18:35:28 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And that is all good, as long as you remember how important the work is you do while you fly, or gun, or engineer."

18:35:42 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I will do whatever is needed."

18:35:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Always moving can actually get you into a lot of trouble on cruisers and other types of flying."

18:35:56 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I am still not really so in love with flying though."

18:36:06 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Flying is cool."

18:36:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I don't and wouldn't always move. Just move more frequently on a rapad than a non rapid."

18:36:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And if you move too much with rapids, you'll get hit more and can break failsafes very quickly."

18:37:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I still try to avoid unnecesary moving on a rapid, but then, you should probably listen to Shule's advice more than mine, because some of my flying does not go as I wish."

18:37:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "It seems like you need the balance from moving too much or too little."

18:38:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What really is annoying is both a rapid, and being chained by multiple enemies."

18:38:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Flying is about timing really."

18:38:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Timing and rhythm."

18:38:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If you get the rhythm right, it's nearly impossible to hit you."

18:38:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay I am going to agree to disagree on the "fun" of flying beaons."

18:38:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think with a rapid, you also need to try and stay reasonably close to it. Save your escorts for last and do not chase them."

18:39:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And yes, be aggressive with rapids."

18:40:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 2,611,111.11 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person flying wing "Stormy Skies".

19:04:33 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hi all, as promised I sent our statement to our government liaison and a notice to the liaison office. I did this on monday evening shortly after I determined the results of our vote for a non binding resolution. I also informed the liaison office of the result of this vote, as in keeping with my duties as your voice. It would seem that our urgent message has not reached our government, and so I now sent a copy to our president directly, hoping it will reach him in time. While I am still in this office, I will do my best to keep you up to date and do anything within my power to help. Take care and fly safe, Kim. [17:04  6 July 2317 GST]

19:22:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:22:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:46:43 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have one left Hakeem."

20:46:47 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Ted and Hakeem."

20:47:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, Nice. What missions are you doing?"

20:47:16 [Tactical Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I have a few left but need about 30."

20:47:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Kim, did you hear Hakeem's call for beacons, or were you slightly too late?"

20:47:41 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, I must have missed that."

20:47:46 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "OK Caleb."

20:47:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I think you were literally waking up as it happened."

20:47:59 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Not much interest now, I will try in a bit."

20:48:03 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I could do now, or I could wait half an hour."

20:48:05 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK."

20:48:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just some accord salvage missions."

20:48:24 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can do now, not sure I'll still be here in half an hour though."

20:48:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wanted to knock them out quickly."

20:48:30 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hoping to take the Scythe."

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 1,257,517.97 credits.

21:03:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Libertarians Defense Corvette Alpha".

21:06:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Any word on this hauler?"

21:06:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The gimbled ghost?"

21:06:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

21:07:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I like to imagine there's a really exclusive party raging on board."

21:08:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'd like a fine to be paid to each of us. Call it a pilot risk fine and split it among us all."

21:08:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That's an bari infestation waiting to happen."

21:08:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "True."

21:11:27 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I might be in."

21:12:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:12:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:12:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:12:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:12:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:12:46 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:12:47 You exit the ship.

21:12:47 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person Accord gemini "The Wolves Have Eyes", the two-person light transport "Jack Of All Trades", the two-person Accord gemini "Celestial Alhena", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

21:12:51 The two-person Accord gemini "Crossfire" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

21:12:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:12:55 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:12:57 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:12:57 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:13:10 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:14:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Kim, they want you to send that statement to lambeth by letter as well please."

21:15:39 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 174,194.93 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

21:16:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, the one Ather helped us draft, which we all signed, and that I already sent to Mr. Lambeth in a letter on monday evening 10 minutes after you and Shule whitnessed me concluding the vote? The same one I sent to our president less than 2 hours ago?"

21:16:56 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:16:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:16:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What would be good shorthand for monday?"

21:17:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:17:05 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:17:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And, who are they?"

21:17:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:17:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

21:17:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:17:15 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Mndy?"

21:17:15 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 545" has jumped into the sector.

21:17:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ather and Eli."

21:17:18 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 545! Welcome to home space!"

21:17:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:17:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:17:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17:26 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:17:29 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Mndy or mnday."

21:17:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:32 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:17:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:38 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:17:40 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

21:17:41 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

21:17:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:17:53 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "They like vowels apparently."

21:17:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi love."

21:18:00 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I suck at short hand, I wouldn't know."

21:18:05 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Mon then?"

21:18:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:18:12 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:18:17 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Include some vowels. Could be helpful."

21:18:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:18:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:18:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:18:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:18:47 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I think I'm going to call it a day, night everyone."

21:18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I told you and Shule on monday I was gonna send it right away, which I did. It is too big for the terminal and so I sent a notice through the terminal informing the liaison office about the result of our vote, and to inform Mr. Lambeth I was sending him our statement which I then also did."

21:18:52 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Night."

21:18:53 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Need four for approval."

21:21:14 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:21:17 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why would they not let you?"

21:21:48 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Well, they asked for vowls. So we gave them vowls."

21:21:55 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ok, let me call again, beacons? I had Kim and Caleb, not sure if they are still interested."

21:22:08 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Yep."

21:23:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:23:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:23:08 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ok, people, Chetumal please."

21:23:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:23:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:23:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:23:24 There appear to be about 23 pilots recently active.

21:23:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:23:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:23:32 The ship is already moving.

21:23:34 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

21:23:34 
AEU transport "Registered Merchant 132" departed to League sector Colonial Gate (Beta-1) approximately 3 minutes ago.
AEU scout "White Eagle" departed to Unclaimed sector The Dusty Reaches (Beta-3) approximately 3 minutes ago.

21:23:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:23:40 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 174,194.93 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

21:23:41 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

21:23:41 
AEU transport "Registered Merchant 132" departed to League sector Colonial Gate (Beta-1) approximately 3 minutes ago.
AEU scout "White Eagle" departed to Unclaimed sector The Dusty Reaches (Beta-3) approximately 3 minutes ago.

21:23:51 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 132" has jumped into the sector.

21:23:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:23:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

21:23:54 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 132! Welcome to home space!"

21:23:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:23:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:23:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:23:59 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:24:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

21:24:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:24:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:24:03 The computer reports that the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm" has jumped into the sector.

21:24:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:24:04 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:24:06 [General Communication] Michael Barnoble transmits, "Unfortunately, tying up the QE communicator with overly long -- one might argue malicious? -- messages would in fact be a danger to ALL exploration ships out of communications range, so we've had to increase the number of approvals required for everyone's safety! Please just refuse to approve an inappropriate message!"

21:24:06 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

21:24:08 The computer reports that the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm" has jumped into the sector.

21:24:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

21:24:11 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Rainstorm! Welcome to home space!"

21:24:12 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:24:26 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Rhib" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

21:24:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:24:27 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:24:29 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Valkyrie" has jumped into the sector.

21:24:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

21:24:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:24:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:24:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:24:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:24:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:24:48 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:24:48 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:24:49 You exit the ship.

21:24:49 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm", the two-person Accord gemini "Celestial Alhena", and the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
Sean Sloan is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

21:24:50 Sean Sloan just went into the sleek glass doorway of the pilot lounge.

21:24:50 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lower the approvals, four is a bit hard to come by."

21:24:51 The reactionless drive of the two-person Accord gemini "Celestial Alhena" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

21:24:55 [Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

21:24:55 You see a gleaming granite-topped bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a trash can emblazoned with the triumphant image of Space Chief Marshal Nina Thomas here.
Sean Sloan is standing here.
You can go out.

21:24:56 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

21:25:08 Hakeem Oiadip just arrived.

21:25:09 Hakeem Oiadip waves.

21:25:11 Jada Nelson just arrived.

21:25:12 You wave.

21:25:12 Sean Sloan waves.

21:25:15 Hakeem Oiadip holds Sean Sloan's hand, taking him into his group.

21:25:17 Hakeem Oiadip holds your hand, taking you into his group.

21:25:17 Jada Nelson waves.

21:25:19 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:25:20 Hakeem Oiadip holds Jada Nelson's hand, taking her into his group.

21:25:25 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Waiting on KIm."

21:25:29 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person Accord gemini "Valkyrie" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

21:25:46 Hakeem Oiadip removes a decoy beacon from a dark green canvas backpack.

21:25:59 [General Communication] Michael Barnoble transmits, "Unfortunately, requiring a lower number of approvals has had poor, even potentially endangering, results!"

21:26:13 A nearby pilot rolls his eyes and mutters something about "those idiot Fringers." He appears to have a Fringe shipsuit on backwards.

21:26:16 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Would the accord agree to lowering it by one."

21:27:17 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the scout "White Eagle" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

21:27:32 Jada Nelson removes a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades 2317 Edition" from a violet backpack.

21:27:33 Kim Saunders just arrived.

21:27:35 Hakeem Oiadip waves to Kim Saunders.

21:27:36 Jada Nelson waves to Kim Saunders.

21:27:37 You wave to Kim Saunders.

21:27:39 Hakeem Oiadip holds Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into his group.

21:27:39 You hug Kim Saunders.

21:27:40 Sean Sloan waves.

21:27:42 Hakeem Oiadip asks, "All ready?"

21:27:43 "Hi!" Kim Saunders waves.

21:27:47 Jada Nelson begins reading in a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades 2317 Edition".

21:27:49 Hakeem Oiadip smiles.

21:27:51 Sean Sloan nods.

21:28:00 Hakeem says to Jada, "No reading, gunning!"

21:28:02 You follow Hakeem Oiadip out.

21:28:02 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
Hakeem Oiadip and Sean Sloan are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

21:28:03 You say to Hakeem Oiadip, "May I engineer?"

21:28:11 Jada Nelson says, "I will."

21:28:12 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Please, Shule, yes."

21:28:14 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods northeast.

21:28:15 Hakeem Oiadip grins at Jada Nelson.

21:28:15 You nod.

21:28:16 Jada Nelson puts a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades 2317 Edition" in a violet backpack.

21:28:17 The two-person cipactli "Rainstorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

21:28:18 You follow Hakeem Oiadip aboard the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm".
[Starship "Rainstorm"; Airlock]
You see a personal hoverpallet here.
Hakeem Oiadip and Sean Sloan are standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:28:19 You follow Hakeem Oiadip into the ship.

21:28:19 [Starship "Rainstorm"; Control Room]
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Hakeem Oiadip and Sean Sloan are standing here.
You can go up and out.

21:28:20 Hakeem Oiadip grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from him.

21:28:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:28:21 You can't go that way.

21:28:22 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Might I remind the accord that the person who caused the initial raise in approvals is a member of an alliiance not even part of the Accord."

21:28:23 Hakeem Oiadip uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:28:27 [Starship "Rainstorm"; Control Room]

21:28:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.

Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Hakeem Oiadip, Sean Sloan, Jada Nelson, and Kim Saunders are standing here.
You can go up and out.

21:28:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Rainstorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:28:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:28:33 Hakeem Oiadip sits down on a dark purple leather captain's chair.

21:28:33 Jada Nelson says, "Hmm."

21:28:35 Hakeem Oiadip loads a decoy beacon into a decoy beacon launcher.

21:28:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:28:39 Jada Nelson jogs up.

21:28:43 Hakeem Oiadip presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:28:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:28:43 Sean Sloan walks up.

21:28:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:28:44 Hakeem Oiadip removes a secondary pilot command access unit from a dark green canvas backpack.

21:28:44 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

21:28:44 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, a harmless message about something I sent in the mail on monday requires 5 people's approval?"

21:28:47 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:28:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:28:49 [Starship "Rainstorm"; Weapons Room]

21:28:49 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Jada Nelson and Sean Sloan are standing here.
You can go south and down.

21:28:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:28:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:28:52 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:28:52 Jada Nelson jogs down.

21:28:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:28:54 [Starship "Rainstorm"; Control Room]

21:28:54 You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Hakeem Oiadip is sitting on a dark purple leather captain's chair. Kim Saunders is lying down. Jada Nelson is standing here.

21:28:55 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:28:57 You say, "Umm."

21:28:58 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Rainstorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:29:01 Sean Sloan walks in from above.

21:29:05 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Say sorry."

21:29:09 Hakeem Oiadip presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:29:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:29:09 You ask, "We're in a two-person ship?"

21:29:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

21:29:10 Jada Nelson joins Hakeem Oiadip's group.

21:29:13 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:29:13 You chuckle.

21:29:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:29:15 You grin.

21:29:15 Hakeem Oiadip says into the PA microphone, "Wrong ship people."

21:29:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:29:16 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:29:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

21:29:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:29:18 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

21:29:18 Kim Saunders giggles.

21:29:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:29:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:29:21 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:29:22 Hakeem Oiadip stands up from a dark purple leather captain's chair.

21:29:22 You stand up.

21:29:24 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Rainstorm! Welcome to home space!"

21:29:25 Hakeem Oiadip holds your hand, taking you into his group.

21:29:25 You grin.

21:29:32 Kim Saunders stands up.

21:29:42 Hakeem Oiadip presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:29:42 Hakeem Oiadip struggles to see around Jada Nelson as he works with a nearby control panel.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

21:29:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:29:49 [General Communication] Michael Barnoble transmits, "You may remind the Accord of whatever you wish! This is a safety measure."

21:29:52 Jada Nelson says, "Sorry."

21:29:53 Hakeem Oiadip holds Sean Sloan's hand, taking him into his group.

21:29:59 Hakeem Oiadip says, "No problem."

21:30:00 Hakeem Oiadip holds Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into his group.

21:30:01 Jada Nelson
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has caramel skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and strong calves. She has rounded shoulders and rather large breasts. Her face is oval and lovely, with a delicate nose and round chin. Her lips are full and brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are brown and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, very curly hair is dark chocolate brown with gold streaks and hanging in tiny, delicate ringlets. She has oval clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a sleeveless amber cotton dress with a row of tiny matching ribbon rosettes at the neckline and hem and a pair of white flats. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a violet backpack, a flight control scanner, a primrose yellow touch einrophone in a brown leather phone holster, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a personal filing computer, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a purple vinyl duffel bag, a compact metallic sapphire blue camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery blue camera strap, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, both thighs, both knees, both calve
21:30:01 s, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cool glass of water in her left hand.

21:30:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:30:04 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:30:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Rainstorm. We read your Fringe transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of Chetumal City."

21:30:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:30:09 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Too many storm ships."

21:30:11 Hakeem Oiadip sighs.

21:30:13 You laugh.

21:30:16 You say, "It's ok."

21:30:18 Hakeem Oiadip removes a decoy beacon from a dark green canvas backpack.

21:30:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:30:21 Hakeem Oiadip pulls a large lever towards him.

21:30:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:30:22 You follow Hakeem Oiadip out.

No damaged components.


Hull damage failsafes remaining: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 97%

21:30:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:30:43 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the fact that it's a quantumly entangled message mean that it's perfectly safe since only the entangled particles react?"

21:30:43 You sit down on a dark purple leather captain's chair.

21:30:44 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

21:30:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:30:51 Hakeem Oiadip's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please, make sure we are in the right ship."

21:32:55 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "That's why they increased the approvals anyway?"

21:33:08 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "So people like Pierre can't send messages like that."

21:33:11 [General Communication] Michael Barnoble transmits, "Indeed, and the number of approvals required was raised after those messages too."

21:33:12 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "And now folks can understand more approvals, since folks were alright sending those kinds of messages."

21:33:31 Hakeem Oiadip's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I will see that the quarters are well supplied for your needs during a beacon."

21:33:40 You chuckle into the PA microphone.

22:23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay guys its time to say something. I need to get this off my chest. You guys are my family, this alliance is family the pilot corps is a body that needs to be nourished to flourish. You guys are my arms, my legs and I can not function without you just as in all things you can not function without me. We must be unitied with a single goal and purpose to stand a chance and not isolated from one another. That goes from within this corps and not just how we interact with others."

22:23:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I agree with you that we need to be united."

22:24:24 You scramble to your feet.

22:24:24 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:24:26  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

22:24:26 You are carrying nothing.

22:24:28 You exit the ship.

Lily Kaise is sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go north.

22:24:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Some days I feel like folks do not care and if you have lost hope for any reason then I am here for you to talk to and lets see what can be done."

22:24:43 I can't find "sofa."

22:24:45 You sit down on a large leather couch.

22:24:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

22:26:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It does need to be done together though because a rusty cog never turns."

22:27:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What does get under my skin is really only 1 thing though. 2 people who have decided to choose this time to go on some trip somewhere, decide to ask over the qe whether I who stayed at home am actually doing my job?"

22:28:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They are concerned or at least I hope they are for the AEU."

22:28:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Do not let it bother you."

22:28:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "At least they are asking."

22:28:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Then they should be here, at home."

22:28:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "At least they asked, they could have left and just did not bother."

22:29:26 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:30:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think their intent was good, Kim. Maybe not the execution."

22:30:12 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:30:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup someone should ask them that question right? I can't stay here for but a couple of moments but I love it how others get their backs up when they are disconnected from reality."

22:30:24 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:31:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:31:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "They could have asked, before leaving, hey guys with the government about to make some changes that can have a profound impact on all of humanity, can we be missed a few weeks... But they didn't. I've said what I needed off my chest, rant over."

22:32:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And... I am not upset with you Vernos, after all, you are only, the messenger of what they asked."

22:36:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not pointing fingers or saying anyone doesn't care but it is time to take a deeper inventment in the alliance and that goes for all of us."

22:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Investment I mean."

22:37:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, make a proposal of how to, I am all ears."

22:39:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Work for the alliance, make our voices known but respectfully. Stay out of the news as pilots and make sure everyone in the other corps understands we are doing our best not to isolate ourselves anymore."

22:40:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "When they give you crap, just nod, say you understand and are working to improve things and try not to be offended."

22:40:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I participate in as many activities with pilots form other alliances as much as possible."

22:40:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Good, go out and be social with them too."

22:41:00 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Economy."

22:41:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

22:42:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Honestly that letter we wrote needs to hit the public but I don't know how to do that yet without setting off trouble."

22:42:56 Your communicator reports that...

22:42:56 
At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

22:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And most of us have been social with people from other alliances as well. My time is a bit limited for when I can be at work, but in the passed, when I could, I was social."

22:46:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I hang out in other lounges from time to time, work closely with Morris in Starseekers and with all orgs on temp stations, go on beacons from generally everyone who calls for them, and have really worked with anyone ever since I joined the corps. I honestly can not recall a single thing I might have done that indicated I was wanting to be an isolationist."

22:46:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Beacons, nests, you name it."

22:47:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Exactly, Kim. Heck, I'vehelped pilots from other alliances learn how to gun, fly, even helped and encouraged them to get there cruiser qualification."

22:48:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The reason I ask if others want to fly on my beacons is not because I hate flying. I love it. However, I also love watching other people learn to be good at combat flying."

22:51:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Jack Of All Trades". The organization has earned 145,778.47 credits.

22:52:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

22:53:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If you want to talk about isolationist attitude, go talk to the League pilot that practically told me to stand down when I already responded to a threat in League space. Then they came in and took over fighting without telling me and then never even thanked me for helping defend their space. Now, I don't know of any AEU civilian pilot that is active right now who has ever done that to a pilot from another alliance."

22:57:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, Melinda and several other pilots, League, AEU, even fringe, have taught me a lot in the past few years. Between Akira, Melinda and Annie they taught me how to fly and the first gunship I think I flew was Melinda's."

23:02:04 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of tritium-rich hydrogen has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Jack Of All Trades". The organization has earned 54,344.35 credits.

23:03:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:04:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Heck, after I got my cruiser, I can't tell you how many times people from all alliances used to hang out in it after beacons or missions. I don't boot people off my ships for that very reason. I have no problem with people hanging out after missions or beacons or whatever in my ships."

23:06:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well this sounds a bit defensive."

23:07:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Glad to know that folks are out being social and working with others though."

23:09:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's not being defensive. It's just stating the truth. You're telling us to do things, not realizing that we've been doing most, if not all of that, for months and years."

23:10:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I can only go on what I am told and what I have personally seen, Shule. Was not saying you don't do these things."

23:15:25 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

23:16:22 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

23:16:27 Lily Kaise slumps in a large leather couch and goes to sleep.

23:20:22 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "So, how many could I get for a Salvage Op. I didn't see any Command on my last report for League. I'm sure folks liked the command for those, and we have I believe six cans to still use."

23:20:37 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I could join."

23:20:44 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sure."

23:21:01 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'll gun or engineer for defense."

23:21:36 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Alright, that's more like it. That's four now. I could use one more for defense, and then will need only just two medium transports for salvage."

23:21:49 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Need to be able to grapple grade 60."

23:23:24 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Alright changing plans slightly. Downgrading to the belt of Orion, and I'll salvage and the three can go on defense. Will only need one more transport, Light or Medium, but can grapple grade 40."

23:23:25 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I can help too with that op."

23:24:01 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Oh ok, salvage or defense for you Kim? And I think your meaning the 285 area for you being in."

23:24:21 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I can do either."

23:24:48 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Alright, I'll let Vern run the defense and you and myself can Salvage then."

23:25:06 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Vern needs two more people, but could do it with one more."

23:25:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead! Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be annoying, but... but... oh God, I've wasted my life."

23:25:21 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure, I'll help with the op."

23:25:39 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Ok, which for you? Salvage or Defense."

23:26:41 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Where are we gathering?"

23:27:13 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Grab your gunship Vern and meet on new Earth. Salvagers, we will be headed out to 285 as soon as you can. When Vern has a crew setup, then he can come out."

23:27:22 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

23:27:24 You stand up from a large leather couch.

23:27:26 You pull Lily Kaise to her feet.

23:27:54 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:27:54 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
You can go south and out.
It sure takes a lot of time to drag unconscious people around!
(6 seconds roundtime.)
Lily Kaise followed you.

23:27:59 Wait 1 seconds.

23:28:00 You place Lily Kaise on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:28:04 You disband your group.

23:28:04 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

23:28:04 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:28:05 You exit the ship.

23:28:05 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]

23:28:07 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:28:08 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:28:08 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:28:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:28:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:28:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:28:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:28:25 The ship is already moving.

23:28:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:28:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:28:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:28:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:28:28 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

23:28:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:28:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:28:33 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Headed out to grab the scan."

23:28:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:28:34 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:28:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:28:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:28:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Just for this cadet's edification about how long does a salvage op normally last roughly?"

23:28:38 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Can."

23:28:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:28:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:28:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:28:40 The computer reports that the five-person gunship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!" has landed on the planet New Earth.

23:28:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

23:28:44 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:28:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:28:59 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, this is happening at 285, correct?"

23:29:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:29:01 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:29:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:29:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:29:10 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Correct."

23:29:15 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

23:29:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:29:16 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:29:20 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ok."

23:29:22 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:29:29 I don't understand that.

23:34:30 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport snickers.

23:34:36 You chuckle.

23:35:03 Michael Kennedy navigates his royal blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:35:15 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "How did you cut the power? I hope not from the engineering room?"

23:35:15 A pair of pilots stride in haughtily, glimmering with gold and diamonds.

23:35:18 Vernos Bailey puts a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" in a small cloth sack.

23:35:23 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "No."

23:35:40 Michael Kennedy navigates his royal blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:40:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:40:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:40:26 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

23:40:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:40:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:40:47 The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space station.

23:40:57 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

23:40:57 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

23:41:07 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

23:41:26 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

23:41:42 [Starship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!"; Engineering Room]

23:41:43 Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a first contact kit, an improved temporary wormhole drive, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Business Cats", and a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.
You can go north and south.

23:41:49 You sit down on a swiveling black leather gunner's chair.

23:41:54 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the north.

23:41:54 You peer north...

23:48:40 [Starship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!"; Engineering Room]

23:48:40 Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

23:48:54 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Where do you wan me to land when I arrive?"

23:48:56 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Non Serviam". The organization has earned 272,278.15 credits.

23:49:21 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Land ong the deep space operations. That way I can swap with you there."

23:49:30 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "On, my apologies."

23:49:42 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Okay, you heard that, right Vern?"

23:49:53 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

23:50:05 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Good."

23:50:20 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Two and a half."

23:50:49 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'm fixin' to land."

23:51:45 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "One minute."

23:52:26 You sit down on a swiveling black leather gunner's chair.

23:52:36 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'm landed and waitin'."

23:52:44 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am on the repair station ready for when you need me."

23:52:45 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:52:54 I don't understand that.

23:52:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:53:03 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Ok, just waiting on Vern to enter. I'll be putting the can one up from the main sector."

23:53:15 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Kim if your on defense please come to the operations station."

23:53:23 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "She is on salvage."

23:53:28 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay."

23:53:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:53:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

23:54:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:54:09 You peer out...

23:54:09 
[League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Rocking These Chains", the two-person medium transport "Delivering The Goods", and the five-person gunship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!" are parked here.
Rogue Romano and Vernos Bailey are standing here.
You can go north, east, south, up, and down.

23:54:23 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Alright, launch."

23:54:31 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I cleared it with captain. Engineerin' is mine."

23:54:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:54:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:54:48 Rogue Romano slinks in from the north.

23:54:55 You say, "Go for it."

23:54:55 You grin.

23:54:56 You stand up from a swiveling black leather gunner's chair.

23:54:59 You hug Rogue Romano.

23:55:01 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire has been added to the op as a defender.

23:55:01 [Salvage Op] Rogue Romano has been added to the op as a defender.
[Salvage Op] Michael Kennedy has been added to the op as a defender.

23:55:13 You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.
You can go south and down.

23:55:24 [Starship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!"; Weapons Room Three]

23:55:24 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

23:55:30 You sit down on a swiveling black leather gunner's chair.

23:55:40 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "Uh, where are you putting the can?"

23:55:44 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Gues we're undercrewed."

23:55:48 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "One sector up."

23:55:49 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Guess."

23:55:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:56:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ug, you are under crewed."

23:56:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We should be fine."

23:56:24 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:56:28 There are no other ships in the sector.

23:56:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:56:47 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "In a position for defense to have full open sky to play in."

23:57:25 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "Ug, poor can placement, please use near a corner next time you run it?"

23:57:33 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "Why."

23:57:37 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "And... going east from where the can is."

23:57:42 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire: "It's easier to defend."

23:57:43 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "The can should be placed for defense not salvage."

23:58:00 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt has been added to the op as a salvager.

23:58:13 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "I guess I'll stay down here."

23:58:13 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "It gives salvagers a better chance to drop off without having to fear pirates. And, what shule said."

23:58:36 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "Oh, so you like being in the corner where you have three walls to deal with?"

23:58:45 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "Alright, I'll go with that."

23:59:13 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "I didn't expect you to change it for now, but for next time, please? And, rules on debris?"

23:59:27 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Keep three open and let rogue roam."

23:59:29 [Salvage Op] Jacob Smitt: "I'd say just drop lead, we can keep iron it pays good."

23:59:34 You scramble to your feet.
