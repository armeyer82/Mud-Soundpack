01:45 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

03:41 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

03:41 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

03:41 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

03:41 A droid remote titled "Empanda"

03:41 You see nothing special.

03:41 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

03:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:41 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

03:41 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:41 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

03:41 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

03:41 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

03:42 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

03:42 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

03:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:42 Select a ship:

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:42 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

03:42 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:42 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

03:42 Select a ship:

03:42 [1] the one-person cargo hauler "Siver Raven"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

03:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:42 >> Command Aborted <<

03:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:42 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

03:42 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

03:42 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
