00:01 You have 993,575,404.04 credits.

00:01 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

00:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:01 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:01 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:01 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:01 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:01 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:01 The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

00:01 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:01 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

00:01 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:01 The one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 3937" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

00:01 There are no ships here.

00:01 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:01 There are no ships here.

00:01 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:01 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:01 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

00:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:02 #$#soundpack_pong

00:02 #$#soundpack_lag 188

00:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

00:02 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:02 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

00:02 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

00:44 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

00:44 You stand up.

00:44 You sit down on a dark blue suede sofa.

00:44 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", the six-person destroyer "Off With Their Heads", the ten-person battlecruiser "Vis Vindico", the three-person heliogaster "Bleu Horizons", the eight-person gunship "Rocket Storm", and the eight-person gunship "Blue Star" landed here.

01:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:46 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

01:46 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:46 The ship is already moving.

01:46 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:46 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:46 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:46 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:46 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

01:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

01:47 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "One spot new diffs."

01:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

01:47 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:47 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

02:13 ["Tales of Symphonia" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a hologram of a flickering campfire projected in the middle of the room, a thick covering of bright green grass covering the ground, an ice blue cotton hammock placed in front of the controls, a life-sized concrete light gray statue of a mother rabbit with her sleeping babies curled up against her, and a medium brown pinewood picnic table here.

["Palace of Shadow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, three glowing pink security drones, Zatch the droid, a red bag, a cinnamon colored stallion, a comfortable deep black soft fabric sofa with a light throw over the back, a reinforced square alien crystal lockbox with miniature starships moving beneath a pane of glass inlaid in the lid labeled "palace", a silver trash bin, a large stuffed starship, Ryuzaki the droid, a roll of gold wrapping paper patterned with bells, a yellow box containing black letter paper with a shower of shimmering stars bordering the page, a gift box wrapped in violet wrapping paper patterned with angels labeled "to ray from Cally and Mikey", a gift box wrapped

02:38 ["Tales of Symphonia" Weapons Room 3] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a thick covering of bright green grass covering the ground, and a baby blue cloud-patterned cotton camp chair placed in front of the controls here.
You can go northwest.

02:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:40 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:40 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:40 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:40 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:40 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:40 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:41 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:41 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:41 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:41 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:41 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:47 ["Magical Melody" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see a soft royal purple velvet combat chair, an internal stun turret, and a jelly-filled blue beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest.

04:41 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

04:41 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

04:41 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

04:41 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

04:41 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

04:41 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

04:41 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

04:41 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

04:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

04:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

04:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

04:41 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

04:41 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

04:41 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

04:41 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

04:41 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The one-person conveyor "Selene Intersolar Trade 4380" has entered Jumpgate to Central Jumpgate Hub.

04:41 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

04:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

04:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

04:42 #$#soundpack_pong

04:42 #$#soundpack_lag 111

04:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

04:42 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

04:42 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

04:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

04:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:42 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:42 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This 25 year old woman stands 5 feet and 10 inches tall and is lithe with a large bust size. She has a dark complexion. Her waist-length, midnight black hair is pulled back in an elegant French twist and tied back with white silk ribbons and dotted with shimmering blue sapphires and diamonds. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth. Her abdomen is somewhat heavily rounded and swollen. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.
She has a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her left earlobe and a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat and the nails on her right hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat.
For a top, she is wearing a long black satin shawl with a red teardrop shaped clasp over a conservative black cashmere long sleeve blouse with a lace-trimmed collar and three ruby red pearl buttons down the front and a black silk front clasp bra with a black diamond rose-shaped clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets over a black g-string with tiny metallic studs. She is wearing a pair of sexy black leather combat boots over a pair of ribbed black anklet socks on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an ar

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

15:30 (Docking Bay) The two-person asteroid hauler "Pebbles" begins to slowly float through the docking bay door from outside, being carefully guided by a small army of drones and a contingent of spaceport dock workers. After several moments of careful maneuvering, the ship sets down on the docking bay floor and the drones depart with the workers.

Asteroid Hauling
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Now that you've progressed a bit in the game, you may be looking into alternative sources of income and points. Asteroid hauling is one of those sources!

In this guide, commands that you type will be in italics. Variable parts of a command will be enclosed in <less-than and greater-than signs>. So, for example, if I write "move <coordinates>", you would type "move" and then a set of coordinates, such as "move 1, 1, 1".

  What it is:
Asteroid hauling, or "'roid hauling", is the process of seeking asteroids and hauling them back to space stations for points and credits. This is accomplished by landing on the asteroid and attaching anchors to the north, south, east and west of the ship, and connecting the anchors with lines. Then re-entering the ship and deploying the ship's anchor, and choosing a space station to haul the asteroid back to.

  What you need:
To haul asteroids, you will need a few pieces of equipment. You will need:
- An asteroid hauling ship. Purchase one at your local starship store. You'll need a minimum of 10 points and 10 million credits to purchase one.
- An asteroid hauling supply kit. This holds your anchors and lines. This will cost 5,000,000.0 credits.
- A spacesuit. You will need a spacesuit to survive while you attach the anchors and lines to the surface of the asteroid.
Remember to buy a full set, which includes a top, bottom, helmet, gloves and boots. This will cost 1,000,000.0 credits total.

  How to haul:
Now that you have your supplies, you can find an asteroid to haul! You will need to go out into uncharted space to locate an asteroid. You could start your trip from any sector, but it would take an extremely long time to bring the asteroid back to a station that will accept it. Therefore, it is advisable to start from one of the sectors listed at the end of this file.

Take the jumpgates to the sector that you'll be starting from. Once in that sector, move to its edge by typing "move <coordinates>" (this can be shortened to "m"). It doesn't matter which edge you start from, but it is usually easier to start from 1, 1, 1.

At the edge of the sector, switch the ship into manual control by typing "manual" (this can be shortened to "man"). Now move out of the sector by pressing a number on the numpad that corresponds with the direction leading out of the sector. For example, at 1, 1, 1, to go north out of the sector, type "8". You are now in uncharted space.

First, switch the ship back into autopilot by typing "autopilot" (this can be shortened to "auto"). Scan the sector by typing "starmap" (this can be shortened to "sm"). If you do not see any asteroids in this sector, move on to the next sector the same way you exited your starting sector.

Keep moving from sector to sector and eventually, you should en
16:55 counter an asteroid! At this point you'll want to SCAN the asteroid and make sure it's not enormous. Enormous asteroids cannot be hauled. Making sure the ship is in autopilot, move to the asteroid and land on it. Welcome to your first asteroid!

Make sure that your spacesuit is on and you have your hauling kit handy (you can wear that, by the way). Enter the airlock. Now type "cycle" to cycle the airlock's atmosphere to match the atmosphere on the asteroid. Exit the ship.

Your first task now that you're on the asteroid is to attach the anchors and lines to the surface. First, go north of your ship and type "get anchor from kit" and "get line from kit". Now type "use anchor" to attach the anchor to the asteroid. Once it has attached itself, type "use line" to attach the line to the anchor.

Return to the ship and go south of it. Type "get anchor from kit" again, and use it again. Use the same line again. You've now completed one set!

Repeat this for the east-west directions from the ship, and then enter your ship again. Once you are inside the control room, type "anchor" to drive the ship's anchor into the asteroid. Here comes the fun part!

If your ship does not let you anchor, you probably anchored the asteroid incorrectly. Leave the ship, and walk to all the anchors and type USE ANCHOR, this will cause the anchor and line to detach from the surface so you can set it up properly!

Now that the asteroid is secured, you can type "haul" to begin hauling the 'roid! It will bring up a list of sectors. Choose the one you started from, as it will be the closest.

WARNING: While on the asteroid, your starmap will be distorted and full of interference. This is normal.

The ship's computer will inform you of your distance to the space station. If you accidentally chose the wrong one, you can type "stop" to stop the ship, and choose a better sector to haul it to. Soon enough, you will reach the space station and will receive credits and points for all of your hard work! How much you make is variable depending on the asteroid.

DO NOT FORGET to retrieve your asteroid hauling equipment and put it back in your kit! Your anchors and lines will be on the landing pad of the station. Anyone can come along and steal them, so if you forget them, you may have to buy a whole new kit. There are two ways to do this. The first is to manually type GET ANCHOR, PUT ANCHOR IN KIT, GET LINE, PUT LINE IN KIT, etc. But the more convenient way is to simply type USE KIT. This will cause your asteroid hauling kit to attempt to refill itself using any anchors and lines that may be sitting on the ground. Note, however, that your kit will only take what it needs to fill itself. If you have spare lines and spare anchors, you should store them elsewhere, as they will complete your kit and it will not attempt to retrieve anything.

Happy hauling!

WARNING: If you are not inside your ship when the asteroid is hauled into the station, you will NOT be credited.

17:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Empanda Station.

17:42 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:42 There are no ships here.

17:42 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

17:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:43 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Apartment 26860; Foyer.

17:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

You may keep your apartment if you go through the proper procedure again to ensure that you are able to enter your residence. Otherwise, you will have two weeks from the date of this letter to vacate all items of importance to you as the apartment will be locked. Furthermore, you will be automatically pruned from any mailboxes located in the apartment.

Sincerely,
  The Empanda Station apartments administration

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.

Donating
--------------------------------------------------
NOTICE: If you mistakenly made a payment, PLEASE CONTACT ALBORI. You can ASSIST or e-mail albori@toastsoft.net. I will refund the money. If you reverse the payment in PayPal, I will have to pay a large fee because it looks like I ripped you off. Since that's not the case, please do not file a chargeback with PayPal. Instead, contact me and I will refund your money. That process is free for both sides. Thank you for your consideration.

For more complete information on donating (including how to donate), please see: http://toastsoft.net/donating.html

NOTE: Please be aware that ALL UPGRADES are available to EVERYBODY, despite their donator status. Donating merely gains you access to a more convenient way to obtain the upgrades. They are all in one place rather than flying to 50 different planets. Miriani is a free game and donating merely provides you with conveniences and little things that make no real difference to the game. You will never be expected to pay to receive advanced technology.

This donation program is liable to change or discontinue at any time. If the service were to discontinue, refunds will not be issued. By participating in the donator program or Miriani (or TSPM), you must follow all rules and policies outlined on the appropriate websites and on the MOO itself. Failure to comply with the policies can result in the termination of your donator status without a refund. Please note that the administrators reserve the right to cancel your donator membership at any time they see fit and any decisions made by them are final. By donating, you indicate that you have read and agree to any of the terms and conditions outlined here.

Donator Benefits:

* A big happy super special thank you combined with a warm fuzzy feeling!
* Access to special donator tradesman events (and possibly even the ability to request a tradesman). Tradesman are people who will make custom items for you, which may or may not include custom verbs. For instructions on requesting a tradesman, please see below.
* Access to an all-in-one starship upgrade center. Tell them what you want and they'll get it for you. Note: This service will not work fully during war time, depending on alliance relations between your alliance and the alliance supplying the upgrades.
* Access to a convenient shopping nexus that provides access to all of your favorite gadgets and items in one place.
* Feel special by gaining entrance into a special area reserved for donators, including private apartments, fine dining and special items not found anywhere else in the galaxy.
* Private apartments that include private garages, room names and descriptions. (Just use the RENAME and DESCRIBE commands respectively.)
*** NOTE *** If your donation time lapses, you will lose access to your apartment on Empanda. You will receive a letter in the mail prior to the expiration of your donator benefits.

Donator Tradesman Rules:

* The tradesman has the right to say no and will do so if you ask for any item that requires points to get, unless if you're modifying an item you already bought.
* Items that allow you to stun others will also not be allowed unless it is again modifying something you already own or is very very limited stun time (someone gets 3 seconds while you get one).
* Tradesman items require a rather large amount of time to be created, especially when we have many requests at once. Therefore, we will give our best effort to ensure donators get an item once every 30 days, however, this time frame is not a guarantee as sometimes it may take longer for the item to be completed. That said, the 30 days between items starts upon receipt of the requested item.
* Items you request will not necessarily be done at the moment you request them, but will get done as promptly as possible. 

Tradesman Certificates:

Tradesman certificates are to be seen as OOC items that are redeemed for an IC tradesman item (such as a pet, baby, roller coaster, large cupcake, etc). Because they are to be considered OOC, we do not want anyone to mention them on IC communicators. They are to be treated similarly to host applications. Although you can receive them in the game, you understand they are a means to an OOC purpose and are not to be mentioned i
19:24 n the game.
Please see HELP TRADESMAN CERTIFICATES for specific rules encompassing tradesman certificates.

Refunds:

If you mistakenly donate, please contact us immediately at hosts@toastsoft.net. We're able, and willing, to reverse the transaction with PayPal without anybody incurring any fees. It's important that you don't initiate a chargeback on your credit card, as this will cause unnecessary fees and complications for both sides. Simply e-mail us and we can have PayPal cancel the payment and return your money fee free.

We will only refund donations one week after receiving them, provided you have not taken advantage of the donator benefits outlined above.

Please be aware that we will NOT reimburse you for accumulated donator time. This means that if you have two months of donator time remaining, you CANNOT request that we send you $10 in exchange for removing your donator time. Donations are not to be considered savings accounts, prepaid credit cards, bank accounts, ATMs, or any other service that allows you access to funds on a whim.

23:59 ["Pebbles" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy royal blue soft fabric sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see a comfy royal blue soft fabric sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt and a light brown walnut coffee table here.
You see Miriam Valleris (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy royal blue soft fabric sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) here.
You can go up, down, and out.

23:59 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.
