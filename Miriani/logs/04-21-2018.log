The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.
