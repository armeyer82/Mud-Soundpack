Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot
labeled "Starseekers & Troubleshooters", a large oval light blue and white cloth
rug, a large lacy fern in a white ceramic planter, a glossy purple ceramic felo
chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a Tardick lizard
named Asteria here.
You can go south and down.

[Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "When writing profiles, in the essay
portions where I need to write answers in paragraph form, from whose perspective
should they be written? As in, should I be writing from my character's
perspective, or should I write it as if I am talking about him?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I've honestly known people who have done
it both ways."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Personally, if I were to choose, I'd say
do it in third person, but if you want, do it in third if you're more
comfortable with it."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Is one way preferred over the other?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Er, if I would choose, I'd say do it in
first person, rather."

[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I even knew someone who wrote their
profile in story form. It was pretty decent."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "The examples are in first person, so
that's what I went with."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rubs up against Samantha the large violet felo,
and both animals purr softly.
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "And, last question, but which section
is appropriate for me to use to highlight my character's special talents, such
as an affinity for science, etc?"
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Rift Surfer The Legend Continues at South

[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "To be honest, I don't know too much about
the prompt profile. I did mine in essay form."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "I went with a third person profile, but I
don't think it matters either way as long as the profile is well written."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Blazer at East and Very Slightly Up: "I
did."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "A 2nd-person perspective profile would be

[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "I was worried about that one too,

why I said first or third."

[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Robert I remeber that I looked at the
prompted profile process once, and then went and wrote a long-form profile that
touched on a lot of what the prompts asked about."
"How many so far?" asks Lily.
[Newbie Help] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Comments about particular
talents/abilities, etc., would seem to fit best in your history. They're not
personality traits or goals, so that narrows it down."

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I found the prompts to be harder. I
ended up just writing, then organizing it."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh I dunno, an affinity for science could
be a personality trait. I mean it might not be something you're good at, just
something you're interested in."
"Well i'm ahead of you so if you think your time is limited," says Lily, "I can
wait fro you to get some more."

history woo!"

Lily Kaise kisses you.
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "I did the prompt thing. Sometimes
it does help to do it that way."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It really is to each their own. Some
people, as was pointed out juts feel more comfortable answering a series of
questions."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I submitted it essay...the prompts
didn't help much...not me personally. Of course I also really stressed about it
when my first one was rejected. Still waiting to hear on the second."
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "I've done both. It depends on what I
have in mind and the char I wanted to portray. If I felt I had a good back story
I went unprompted. If I had only a small idea I went with prompts."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Things that I liked were in the
personality. As I worded it in such a way to attempt to show why my character
had the personality that she did."

Lily smiles at you.
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "I wrote mine in essay form. Of course,
I kinda went a bit overboard and my profile's the longest one I've ever seen.
Also, it got rejected a couple times before I got a couple of the minor details
right, so don't worry if it takes you a few tries. If you're really really
stuck, send in a support ticket and ask for some staff help."
'So, you said that for a while you weren't even remotely interested in me, what
turned  the tide?
"So," you ask, "you said that for a while you weren't even remotely interested
in me, what turned the tide?"
Lily says, "I think we've had this discussion before."
Bert the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from above.
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from

[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "How many profiles have you seen?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I did...and babbled. Then got over it
and started with a fresh head. I have my fingers crossed, though I must admit,
I'm nervous."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I wrote mine in third person. But if
you have some specific area of expertise that most people wouldn't have common
knowledge about, it would be good to include. Otherwise it may be out of
character for your character to just start babbling about detailed scientific
theory or something. Remember, alliance pilots in particular are glorified space
truckers for the most part. Not scientific geniuses."
Lily says, "I felt you were into too many women and you didn't seem focused on
what you preferred in a woman."
nod 'Right, but what changed your mind?
"Right, but what changed your mind?" You nod.
"I had the impression that you were in more than one relationshp at the same
time and that you'd go after anyone with a dress on or who exhibited efeminite
qualities," Lily says.
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I butchered that word."
Lily asks, "When we discussed it don't you remember?"
'Well, those were all reasons why you weren't interested in me.
"Well," you say, "those were all reasons why you weren't interested in me."
ooc No worries. I butcher words all the time.
You say, OOCly, "No worries. I butcher words all the time."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Would it be possible for my character
to know various facts from twentieth-century history, such as the fact that the
UN's main offices were in Manhattan, etc? I would want to include a very, very
minor mention of that in my profile, but I want to make sure it's reasonable for
my character to know about that first."
"When you explained that that wasn't your perspective," says Lily, "I felt it
was perhaps worthwhile to get to know you."
Bert the hefty blue soldier felo marches out.
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders up.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Do you know much about the 1700s?"
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Same concept: 300 years ago is a very
long time. If you can work it in in a way that makes sense... maybe?"
"Otherwise," says Lily, "as i've said before, I felt that you were a hard worker
and that you weren't the typical lazy social butterfly type."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That does not seem beyond the scope of
reason. Just remember, things start getting a bit iffy after the 1960's. You'll
ahve to adjust your knowledge to fit into the star conquest space-aged universe,
rather than our information-age universe."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I know a decent bit about 1700's
colonial history, the wars of the 1760's and 1770's...oh, wait, was that meant
to be a rhetorical question?"
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Also, history isn't the same."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, remember that things diverged way
before the OOC time..."
nod
You nod.
[Newbie Help] Lindsey Gaiman transmits, "It's possible but, much like orphans
existing, every time somebody does it's awful. So you probably shouldn't do
that."
"You know people like Angel," says Lily, "Kyle, Gray, a few others in our
alliance."
[MTTS] atherj: That was so mean, Lindsey.
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I was thinking about the establishment
of the UN in the 1940's, so that's before the time of diverging histories."
[MTTS] dragonfire: That made me stop typing my response, gasp, then laugh really
really hard.
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "The question would be why would your
character care or need to know this?"
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "If you scoot over to http://squidsoft.net
:7779/background, you can see a a bit of detail about when and where it split
from the real timeline."
[MTTS] canpher: That was priceless.
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Timeline? Was I supposed to read that?
I mean... Uh... Yeah, yeah I read that."
'Right
You say, "Right."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Aisling, you bring up a good point.
Glad I'm using you guys as a sounding board before I sit down to write this."
[MTTS] Lindsey Gaiman: Every time somebody does that it's just them being lazy.
It's wanting to play a person with their personal knowledge instead of someone
that isn't them.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.
pet shasta
You stroke the soft fur of Shasta the big onyx soldier felo.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand.
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No problem. It's what we're here for."
Lily says, "I also haven't seen anyone from League who I felt had much of a
career objective or who had a personality which wasn't either obnoxious or into
how much drama he could stir up."
Lily laughs.
laugh
You laugh.
[MTTS] dragonfire: I wouldn't necessarily say that. If it fits in with the
character in a very very reasonable way, not just some random bit about enjoying
history, then I could see it. But yes, I'd say for the most part, you're
probably correct.
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Is discussion of this sort technically
even supposed to occur on this channel? I'm pretty sure it is, but I want to be
darn sure."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Remember that they want to know a lot
more about *who* you are and not *what* you are."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "If not here, then where?"
"Most Fringers are too dumb to find their way out of a paper bag," Lily says.
Lily laughs.
[MTTS] atherj: Arguably, not every single thing that one ends up doing is
completely new stuff to them that isn't personal knowledge. I think that there
is almost always personal knowledge in there somewhere.
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "We're not discussing specifics so I'd say
it's fine."
laugh
You laugh.
[MTTS] Myrv: Newbie channel is for questions like 'gnetials stuck in blender how
out?'

This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is closed.
Inside it you see a black plastic undersea castle and a small plastic statue of
a bikini-clad mermaid.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and violet round wings, a
perfectly proportioned soft green many-footed creature with a white spherical
shell, and a tiny startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet split
wings are living in it.
That's three creatures, and the tank could probably safely hold two more.

Incoming hypercaster transmission from Outpost K-895 at South: "Do two people

[Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold
fringe, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, an overstuffed sofa
