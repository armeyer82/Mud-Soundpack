Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very
well built and maintained station.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova"
You see a cruiser here.
"Supernova" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AH-12b" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. The bays of its minicannon
launchers are oiled to perfection and painted silver. Its landing struts are
clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a silver AEU logo forward on the starboard side, a geodesic radome, a
smooth dome, and a single large port covered by an iris-style hatch on the
forward end, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Chi-2" has
landed on the planet New Earth.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
(KcP5v~qQGw72nTawu6t(!zaPe;eJS]*G3]B74:6
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2721 light-minutes per second from Galactic West and
Very Slightly Up."
A large gas giant floats here, glowing bright white in the light of its suns.
The surface appears regular and still, but certainly that's merely an illusion.

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in the upper atmosphere of Saturn.

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in the upper atmosphere of Saturn.

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in the upper atmosphere of Saturn.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and

The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking
bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an

seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

--
Star Conquest Help: Atmospheric Scooping
--
Category: Activities
--
Atmospheric scooping is an activity performed by using a specialized vehicle to
dive into the upper atmosphere of a gas giant and scoop up hydrogen, some amount
of which will be tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that has
applications in nuclear science.
Vehicles for atmospheric scooping are available on DeMargas Station, which is
across a quantum skim accelerator gate found in Gateway. An atmospheric scoop
mount must first be installed on the ship you intend to use for this purpose.
Any starship with a storage hold will do, the bigger the better.
Your first atmospheric scoop will be a low-level basic model, but new models
become available as you increase your industry points. Most models are not
necessarily a straight upgrade, but rather will specialize in a certain role, so
choose according to your preference.
Upon purchasing these two things, take your ship to any gas giant; for example,
Jupiter in the Sol System. Autopilot to the planet, and choose the option to
descend into the upper atmosphere. Your ship will be safe here as long as it can
maintain powered flight -- which means don't run out of charge!
Once in place, use the SCOOP command to begin flying the atmospheric scoop
itself. Take note: your scoop will now constantly be in flight until you return
to your ship, so keep a close eye on what's going on!
Naturally, your scoop will start at a depth of zero, but as you descend, depth
will increase. Once you're a few kilometers down into the atmosphere, you will
begin seeing clouds. These are your target, as they are far more likely to
contain the tritium you're looking for. Aim for the cloud, and as you enter it,
open your scoop's intakes to begin taking in tritium. Your scoop will try to
filter out the non-isotopic hydrogen, but understand that this isotope is very
rare -- even a load of hydrogen that's 0.25% tritium is very valuable.
When your scoop is full, return to your ship. Hydrogen will be transferred
automatically from the scoop's storage to your ship's. You will probably want to
take the scoop out again until your ship's hold is full. Once you're done
scooping, go to any location that accepts salvage and transfer your load. You
will be paid based on the percentage of tritium you found.
Commands
The scoop is controlled with just a few commands.
SCOOP: Launch the scoop from your ship.
LOOK: The scoop's description shows some current statistics, in case you lose
track of what's going on.
UP, DOWN, or LEVEL (shortened to U, D, or LEV): Make the scoop climb, dive, or
fly level. This changes your depth.
RIGHT, LEFT, or STRAIGHT (shortened to RI, LE, or S): Make the scoop turn right
or left, or stop turning and fly straight. Use this to match your heading to the
direction of a cloud.
OPEN or CLOSE (shortened to O or C): Open and close the hydrogen intakes. Your
storage hold will gradually fill while they are open. Open only within clouds
for best effect.
CARGO: Check the amount of hydrogen in the scoop's storage.
RETURN: Return to the ship and transfer your stored hydrogen.
COMM: Talk to other scoops deployed by your ship.
Scoop Maintenance
The atmospheres of gas giants are rough -- high winds, caustic trace elements,
chemical slush, even organic matter. Your scoop, in particular its intakes and
rotors, will take gradual damage as you operate it. There is nothing you can do
about this, but don't worry, the damage accumulates slowly, and your scoop will
automatically return if the damage exceeds its safety margins.
While on the ship, your scoop will automatically look after its own maintenance,
gradually restoring itself to working order. You can check its progress with the
STATUS command in your ship's engineering room (this will be in the control room
on cargo haulers). With regular maintenance, your atmospheric scoop can be
operated for one to two cycles each day (about five to nine hours).
Scoopin' an' Groupin'
Your ship (or a friend's) can hold more than one atmospheric scoop, if you wish
to cooperate! This has no mechanical advantage, but may pass the time quicker.
In order to do this, you must both have your scoop-equipped ships on the same
landing pad. Then, the one who wishes to move his or her scoop should use the
MOVESCOOP command, select their ship, and then the other ship. Both scoops will
now be on one ship, and you can scoop together.
Although the tritium will appear to be mixed in storage, each participant will
be paid for the amount and purity of tritium they personally scooped.
Hints
* When you've just emerged from a cloud, you don't necessarily have to go
looking for a new one. Try circling around and diving back in!
* There are other gas giants out there. Look around, explore, or ask other
pilots where to find them. As your scoop increases in quality, you will need to
find planets to match to reach your maximum potential!
* Experiment. Try different strategies and search at different depths. Scooping
is a game of time vs. reward. Find your most efficient method!
