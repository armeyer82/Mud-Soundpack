Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a small seashell pink
trash can, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy
sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and a glass-covered top, and Bert
the hefty blue soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

Subject: Probable Absence This Coming Weekend
Author: kaite
Posted: Thu Jan 21 08:19:10 2016 UTC
--
I live in Alexandria, VA which is in the Washington, DC region of the U.S.
Beginning Friday afternoon, we are expecting blizard conditions through Saturday
night with a total snow accumulation of 18 to 24 inches. In the past during
similar storms, I have lost power to my home for from one to 3 or more days.
Even though I have underground utilities, it seems that other areas fail which
don't have underground utilities but join up at the same sub-station and so it
goes that controlled outages occur. I have been invited to go stay over the
weekend with my best girl buddy and her teenaged daughter in Arlington, VA. If
they still have power and internet service, I'll certainly login some. I'll want
to focus more of my time with being with my friends and her daughter will have a
couple of others staying over. Anyway, if anyone else is similarly affected, be
safe and good luck! I may not make it back home until Monday or as late as
Tuesday as they take awhile to clear the roads in the residential areas. Have
fun! and don't drama too much! without me around! I don't want my character,
Lily to miss out on it you know!

You can enforce roleplay against a guy, over and over and over, but not support
him in realistic roleplay once.

Even if your retribution against another character is technically in character,
you should take care that your punishment does not unduly affect the player's
ability to play...
That's straight outta the policy against harassment, so 95% of the playerbase is
breaking policy right now.  Are they all gonna lose their ability to fly ships? 
I lost mine for an alias.

Oh look, no quick response to that.  I lose my ability to do the most important
coded thing in the game for two commands, yet people break the rules for hours
on end, the whole game pretty much and hey, that's okay.

1. Technically you could still play. You have your communicator, why are you not
throwing out your angry remarks out there and roleplay it, instead of here?
2. I do not know why your char lost his license, but doubt it's just for 1
alias. I have watched you the last few days, there is a certain agressiveness in
how you play your character, plus your extreme dislike or fear of felo, that,
based on my understanding of the game, does not really fit with a civilian
pilot. Pilots are not the creme de la creme of alliances according to civilians,
but they did undergo extensive psychological testing long before they made it
into space. Despite their quirks they can be considered emotionally stable. If
you don't understand why your character was stranded, maybe you could find out
through in character means?
i can understand that things have not gone according to plan and it makes you
unhappy. there are ways out of this though, but not by staying angry at the
game, the hosts and us players.
Have a nice day.

You didn't roleplay that scene too well. The people detaining your character had
him dead to rights and yet you did not stop resisting. Had you allowed people to
confiscate his felo, your character probably would have suffered lesser
consequences. Instead you decided to play games. Almost all the characters
involved in that scene have had some pretty recent experiences with new pilots
doing things which were antisocial and which would have had consequences for
them. So they decided to put your character somewhere he can't threaten people
with felo, instead of them putting up with his childish and criminal behavior.
In character, they're waiting for the authorities to issue charges against
Harvey. No one seriously expects it to take more than a day.

All of that is irrelevant.  You cannot by the rules strand anyone and take them
out of play.  You are breaking the rules.  My punishment wasn't for "being mean"
it was for aliasing two commands together.
I'm not saying I give two flying shits if you guys press charges icly against
the pilot.  Not at all.  But I do care that I'm essentially taken out of play
until then, you aren't the law.

The crux about stranding has always been that you cannot strand someone in a
place where there is essentially zero chance for them to return or be found,
like on an asteroid in a random sector at an out of comms asteroid field. Your
character, on the other hand, is in a place that is readily available to pilots
and there is certainly a way for you to both be found and returned. The only
thing that is keeping him there is the fact that his attitude and actions have
led the other pilots to not want to help him at all.

Again, irrelevant, the rules don't state that it's your responcibility to make
people wanna help you.  And if you're mean and piss people off it's OK to strand
you.
They say you can't be taken out of play, this is taken out of play.  How is this
so hard to understand?

No one has removed your communicator from your person, though I am sure they
were sorely tempted. You still have roleplay options, though perhaps not money
or point making options at the moment. Use what you have. Prove your character
is playable.

He's not really playable right now.  He can't fly, he can't blow up the station
and trust me he tried, which is a crock of shit really, but I digress.  He
literally can't do a damn thing.
And you can't take my communicator away because I won't allow you to search me,
some chick tried earlier and the command even said I don't have to do it.

You're right. Harvey didn't have to do it. He doesn't have to do anything but
sit there if he want. Or you could get off the ooc boards and find a way to play
your  character. There are ways. Until then ban you, there are ways. You have
resources at your disposal. You have a character. You have a comm. You have a
lot of stuff. You can mope and pout, or you can find a way to make Harvey
playable, play the character, etc. etc. etc.

Stranding is allowed within reason. There must be the possibility for return,
and if enough time elapses without a rescue NPCs will normally do it.

All of the above! Now, just waiting for the thunder snow to arrive! Winds and
snow have definitely picked up over the past hour or so. I am not a fan of snow!
I moved here like many for work and attempts to get back to Florida where I
would prefer to call home haven't succeeded thus far. They're still predicting
20 to 30+ inches of snow here.Who can I send it to?

We're expecting to get socked in here as well. Everybody who's in a similar
situation please take care and stay safe.

I'm a bit further north from you in Pennsylvania, and we're supposed to get
18-24 inches here.

I live in Alexandria, VA which is in the Washington, DC region of the U.S.
Beginning Friday afternoon, we are expecting blizard conditions through Saturday
night with a total snow accumulation of 18 to 24 inches. In the past during
similar storms, I have lost power to my home for from one to 3 or more days.
Even though I have underground utilities, it seems that other areas fail which
don't have underground utilities but join up at the same sub-station and so it
goes that controlled outages occur. I have been invited to go stay over the
weekend with my best girl buddy and her teenaged daughter in Arlington, VA. If
they still have power and internet service, I'll certainly login some. I'll want
to focus more of my time with being with my friends and her daughter will have a
couple of others staying over. Anyway, if anyone else is similarly affected, be
safe and good luck! I may not make it back home until Monday or as late as
Tuesday as they take awhile to clear the roads in the residential areas. Have
fun! and don't drama too much! without me around! I don't want my character,
Lily to miss out on it you know!

Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one, I guess? I hope things are going well,
despite being busy. We'll be here when you manage to come back.

All of the above! Now, just waiting for the thunder snow to arrive! Winds and
snow have definitely picked up over the past hour or so. I am not a fan of snow!
I moved here like many for work and attempts to get back to Florida where I
would prefer to call home haven't succeeded thus far. They're still predicting
20 to 30+ inches of snow here.Who can I send it to?

Hello everyone,
As most everyone knows I have been not here for a while and it's mostly because
I have been dealing with a lot of depression lately which most of you know
about. But I am glad to say that I am back again. Though I don't want to get too
involved. I'm not sure what's going on right now. and I'm going to need a lot of
time to get things in order amongst other things.
I'll be glad to get back into events, and plots, and storylines after I get
things situated. It's nice to see everything is going well still though. Looking
forward to creating stories for the future.
POF Jonathan

Hello again everyone,
I am sure some of you remember this post from november of last year. I regret to
inform everyone who's been praying for my best friend, that last night, at 8:00,
she finally lost her long battle with cancer. She was the best friend that I've
ever had, and the longest. We met when we were both five years old, and were
inseparable from then on. It's hard to believe that, after twenty-two long and
beautiful years, I finally have to let her go, but what's harder, is knowing
that her three beautiful children now have to live without a mother, and that
her loving husband is now alone to raise them. I will be there to help of
course, but Aunty could never replace Mama. Please pray for me and the family,
as we try to figure out what to do now.
From myself and the family, we thank you for the support and prayers you've
offered during this difficult time.
Sincerely,
Leah

I'm so very sorry to hear this. I can empathize with how sad and heartbroken you
must be right now. A 22-year friendship doesn't happen every day but when they
do happen it is special. My heart and thoughts go out to you and the family
during this very difficult time.

I'm sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you were very good friends,
and losing someone that close to you is always hard. I hope you find the
strength to keep on living and to help those you can after you've helped
yourself. I wish you the best of luck in dealing with your loss.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the
Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, William Dove!
Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

this crescent-shaped lounge, giving you a clear view to both the landing pad and
the surrounding mountains and other Chetumalian scenery. Comfortable couches are
spaced in neat clusters for pilots to sit in as they socialize and are brought
refreshments by the attractive waitresses. Scattered close to the groups of
couches are multiple holovids tuned to the latest news, captions scrolling
around the edges. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Space Market.

A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Gah, trying to call someone
and it turns out that, one, they're not answering their phone, and two, they
don't have voicemail."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Fun times."
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I guess I'll just send this
person a letter then."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Who you trying to contact
anyway?"
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I was trying to return Kim's
call. I'd written her a letter, and she called me to respond to it. So now we're
playing phone tag."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Is disorganization and the unity
measurement as it pertains to organizations an IC thing, or not? I think the
help file is a little bit unclear."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's IC."
A short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Basically, if you don't have a full
alliance with one of your org's members, orgnaization unity drops. If you have
many members from other alliances in an organization, you eventually achieve
disorganization. All of it is in-character, because it has to do with alliance
relations."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, let's take the AEU, for example. Any
member an AEu person invites into their organization from the league or the
Mutuality will drop the unity rating slightly. Since the AEU has no alliance
relations with the Mutuality, if that same AEU person lets in a member of that
alliance, their unity rating will drop sharply."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its
tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest
and jets off.
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now, another example would be if a member
of the Fringe alliance. If they had an org, and let in someone from the league,
their relations would not be impacted at all, because the league and the fringe
have a full alliance pact. However, if they let in a member of the Mutuality
too, they'll still suffer a slight drop in unity because the fringe and
Mutuality have a non-aggression pact."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I hope it is all now clearer to you!"
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Ah, that makes sense. So if an
AEU-founded organization let someone in from the League, their unity rating
would drop because the AeEU and League have a non-aggression pact."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Correct!"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The more people that AEU person lets in
from the league, the more the unity rating will drop."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "So, let's say some organization we'll
call X ends up getting over, what is it, ten members? Then there's
disorganization...what is that precisely?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think, -think-, don't quote me on it as
I'm still not completely sure about disorganization since I haven't really
played around with it yet and it's been a long time since I've read the
changelog...anyway, I think that disorganization occurs when there are more
members of other alliances in an organization than there are members from the
organization founder's alliance."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's worth noting that inactive members
don't count either way for this stuff."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep!"
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "What makes a member be considered
inactive? If they've not logged on in forever?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Not quite forever, but in some time, yes."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I believe they have to have been inactive
for two weeks to a month."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Again, something I never really paid
attention to, but it's probably in that ballpark."
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
clear plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a high tech
silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard
named Asteria here.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a discount beacon launcher here.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

had his license taken away, to the extent that he even had one, given the fact

even became a pilot. He became upset, well, more upset than he usually is, he
started out asking people to take his felo, then it changed to he was just going
to drop them out somewhere. He started out saying he'd released four, only one
of which was found, and he then said he'd only actually released that one. I'm
dealing with our government on this matter as best I can, as League Voice, and
really all this speculation, discussion about moving him, etc., is only going to
do more harm than good until such time as I find out what they want or expect us
to do, if anything."

stun weapon?"
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "For real!"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

popular songs which were so to the point. I think one was literally called 'Get
a Job'."
Lily Kaise laughs.
laugh
You laugh.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I used to like to read up on that old
historical stuff and look at the song lyrics for various eras. It was
interesting how some were morerelated to regular people and then there was a big
influence of drugs and other influences over time."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
clear plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a high tech
silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it
seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

if I'm free, I"ll go with you."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yeah. I was going to offer the same
thing."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Heh, I need to do alot of artifacting
before I lead a trip there myself."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yeah. Those svp missions really do help
too."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Can't do them anymore, not the
exploration anyway."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "So I just go out to second battle for
now."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yeah. I think you can go to the battle of
mir as well."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Second battle has to be turned in at
the drift, though, so the other one is btter, because less taxes."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Which one is better?"
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "And more points for it from what I
noticed."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Battle of mir."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Mira."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Meia."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Wait, really?"
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yeah, cause those you can turn it at
tmep stations."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "That is better than drift and second
battle?"
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yeah."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Huh, I never new that."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Because drift and second battle still
tax you some."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "True."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Right now, I need to do what'll give
me more points. Heh."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "If I want a quick run I use second
battle, but if it's a day thing it's meia I go to."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Hmm, I'll have to do mir for long runs
then."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Think meia gives more points to but
i'll have to check."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Isn't the bubble an artifacting place
too?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yes, but it's only for people with more
than three hundred exploration."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I'm close to that."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "You need a rift drive to get there."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "So 300 and above for bubble, good."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yeah, so i'm gonna get a rift drive,
at this rate probably next week and then head out thre."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "There."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Just unsure on headings."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "I need to do a long trip, but I just
haven't been able to really make myself yet."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Is there any other way to get
exploration other than artifacting for us yet? And I mean stuff we can do not
get others to so. Like planetery survaying is nice and gives good points and
money, but I think that's 1000 exploration, right?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Something like that. Honestly, once you
get three thousand industry to go with your three hundered exploration you'll be
able to get artifacts from GMG. That's how I've gotten what I wanted."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Heh."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "I need the money for my medium
transport right now, but I'm not even close."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I thougt to do GMG you only needed 300
exploration?"
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I don't even have my colours yet."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "You do, but you don't get artifacts from
it until three thousand industry. Before that you only get crafting supplies."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "In GMG, what do you even do? I know
you get things, but what do yo uahve to do to get those things."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Shoot things, open containers."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I'm asuming those thigns shoot back?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "They do."
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Thanks, when I get the points i'll
have to try it."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights

[Starship "Supernova"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You see an overstuffed black chair, a transparisteel storage case, and an
improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.
