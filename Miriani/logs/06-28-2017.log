Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

02:15 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

02:16 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:16 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

02:16 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:16 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:16 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:16 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:16 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

02:16 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

02:16 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
You must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

02:16 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:16 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:16 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

02:16 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:16 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:16 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:16 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:16 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

02:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:17 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

02:17 You must stand up first.

A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock.

12:14 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, and a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end here.
You can go south, down, and out.

12:14 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

12:14 You are carrying nothing.

12:14 You sniff at yourself. Your nostrils are filled with the scent of Tibo Beauchene.

You can go south and out.

12:18 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:18 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:18 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:18 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:18 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:18 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

12:18 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your chair.

12:18 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:18 The computer announces, "Two planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:18 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:18 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 11, 15."

12:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:18 Sector 11: Universal End (The Hale Collective)

12:18 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:18 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:18 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:18 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

12:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:18 You must stand up first.

12:18 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

12:19 You must stand up first.

12:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:22 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:22 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:46 You peer out and see...

15:46 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

20:21 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
