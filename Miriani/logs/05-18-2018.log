01:00 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | powered | safe | light | indoors
["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an int
01:00 ernal stun turret, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a smiling nanny, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

01:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:00 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:00 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

01:00 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:00 Select a ship:

01:00 [1] the two-person vanguard "Loki"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:00 Invalid selection.

01:00 The ship is already moving.

01:00 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:00 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:00 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:01 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:01 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" has left the sector.

01:01 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

01:01 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:01 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Loki" has initiated an intrasector slip.

01:01 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

01:01 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:01 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Loki" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

01:01 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:01 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:01 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:01 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:01 You say, "jenaia remote"

01:01 Jenaia the droid says in a seductive voice, "You need a free hand for that."

01:01 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a red communicator, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a masculine gold classic wedding band, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a softly padded black snuggly, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a soft white cloth diaper bag patterned with dolphins, a black stun armor storage bag, a level six archaeological dig site scanner, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.

01:01 You are carrying a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in your left hand and a small shovel in your right hand.

01:01 You put a small shovel in a black rolled toolkit.

01:01 You don't see that here.

01:01 I don't understand that.

01:02 You put a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in a sleek black leather carrying case.

Jenaia the droid says in a seductive voice, "My life is now in your hands."

01:02 You put a droid remote titled "jenaia" in a sleek black leather carrying case.

01:02 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end

You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a smiling nanny, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Mekensie the droid here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", and the five-person transverser "Enchanting Melody" landed here.

01:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

01:40 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:40 The ship is already moving.

01:40 The ship is already moving.

01:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:40 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:40 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 6, 5."

01:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:40 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:40 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:40 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels orient themselves toward a star.

01:40 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:40 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:40 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

12:40 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:40 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:40 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:40 You don't see that here.

12:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:40 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

12:40 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

12:40 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:40 The ship is already moving.

12:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:40 [Private | Pippa Lancaster] Pippa Lancaster transmits, "I miss you"

12:41 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:41 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:41 [Private | Pippa Lancaster] You transmit, "Awww, I miss you too!"

12:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:41 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:41 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:44 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:44 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:44 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:44 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

12:44 The ship is already moving.

12:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:44 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20).

12:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:44 The ship must be in space to do that.

12:44 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:44 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

12:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:44 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:44 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Enchanting Melody", the eight-person gunship "Praelor Demolish Enterprize", the one-person expediter "Lightning", the three-person freighter "Blue Moon", and the five-person transverser "Blue Star" landed here.

13:00 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:00 You're already sitting down.

13:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:00 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" has launched from Acrylon.

13:00 You're already buckled in.

13:00 The ship is already moving.

13:00 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:00 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:00 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:00 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:00 > (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" has left the sector.

13:00 There is nothing to see.

13:00 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:00 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:01 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:01 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:01 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:01 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

13:01 You can't go that way.

13:01 Are you sure you wish to boot Tibo Beauchene? [Enter "yes" or "no"]

13:01 Tibo Beauchene has been booted.

13:01 [Venus; Concourse Alpha; Landing Zone and Level 1 Center] (indoors)
Situated on the top level of one of the circular spaceport structures floating high above the Venusian surface, this busy landing pad is the central point for the city's primary unit. The floor is comprised of a highly reflective metallic material with low steel platforms housing a series of landed starships. Off to the side, a bright blue pair of double doors has been labeled as the starship garage. Through an enormous bay beside them, a pair of robotic arms extends, ready to transport starships to and from the crowded landing pad. Through nearly a dozen archways surrounding this cavernous space, wide corridors lead deeper into the city itself. A pair of wide metal steps leads up from the western edge of the landing pad and up through the ceiling which has been painted with a realistic representation of the Solar System.

[A suborbital pod] (indoors)
You see nowhere obvious to go.

13:02 The doors to the pod close and the pod slowly begins ascending. A hatch closes behind the pod as it lifts off into the atmosphere, heading towards the next concourse.

13:02 The pod starts picking up speed, very quickly reaching top trajectory.

13:02 The pod is buffeted in all directions in the planet's atmosphere.

13:02 The pod continues its trek at breakneck speed.

13:02 You are thrown back against your seat as the craft hits an air pocket in the atmosphere and then breaks free.

13:02 The pod's suicidal pace slows as it reaches the next concourse, gently touching down. The doors open and you disembark.

13:27 A letter
Hey Tibo,
This morning I felt our baby moving the first time. It made me so sad that I couldn't take your hand and put it on my stomach so you could feel it too, the life that we both created. I woke up and looked for you, but you weren't next to me. I don't sleep in a bed anymore because I don't support the emptiness. I don't know when you will come back and what will happen if you do. You will read my letters, but maybe it won't change anything. Maybe you loved Kitty all the time, maybe you knew it but didn't want to tell me, or maybe you didn't even know it yourself. You didn't even take time to get over me I guess... or maybe you didn't get over me and you just don't want to be alone. I wish I could feel what you think so things get easier.
I write you even though I know that you won't read the letters until you come back, but I hope it will prove you how much I think of you. I love you, and somehow I hate you for leaving me alone. Love wins most of the time though. I have the hate and the rage more for Kitty, I had it all the time but the situation enforces it. Now she didn't even deserve it, she didn't do anything actually, other than getting you back, because I was not there for you. I guess she doesn't even know about our child. Actually I understand her. She must love you very much, that made her do all that, now that I am in her situation that makes sense. Anyhow I wouldn't say the things about her she said about
13:27  me.
Maybe I should give up and leave you with her, she might make you happier than I do. But I can't, I can't give you up, because of my strong feelings for you, and because of our child. Because of our dreams, and because of our promise. We wanted to marry, and marriage means through better and worse. I just can't give you up that easily.
Tu es l'homme de ma vie et de mon coeur, je t'aimerai pour toujours. Tu es mon seul espoir, je suis qui je suis puisque tu m'aimais et sans toi, je ne suis plus moi.
Yours,
Miriam

13:28 A letter
Tibo,
First of all, yes, i talked to cria, because he asked me how i was, and i wanted to talk with someone about it. I didn't know that he would go about it on chatter, or that he would talk to kitty about it. I received the comms kitty sent cria, and they were not nice. Well, as always. I tracked you, but never told anyone where you are. But let's put some things clear:
I don't regret that i talked about it to cria. That he would go about it no chatter was not planned and i was supprised, but i don't feel bad for him doing that. I didn't want it to be a public matter but yeah, he did it, and that's the way it is now.
Second thing, I tracked you because i wanted to know where you are, because i still cared about you. That someone tried to enter your ship was not my fault, I still wonder why you care about that... nothing happened and i guess you are not that stupid to leave your ship unlocked.
Oh, and last but not least, the funniest thing of them all...
You got three ships of mine, which are, two of my expies, and one of my fighters. And you want to keep them with all the things that are in there if i don't do what you want me to.
I am sorry tibo but, the first time i read that letter I just had to laugh my ass off. Really, I don't want to be mean to you but i thought that you are more intelligent. Tell me honestly, Would you do anything for three such useless ships? I don't care about the ships, and didn't even know there was something in them. Whatever it is, I used the expies maybe two times and bought them from others, so the things in there are not even my stuff.
And concerning the fighter,I still got a lot of money i saved up for our future plans, which were apparently not yours, so that is replaced kind of fast. I even think I still have one docked in one of my ships.
Please tell me that letter was not your idea, or a thing you did out of confusion or dispair, because it seems stupid to me.
I don't need to say more about this part of the letter... i think it's self-explanatory that i won't comply to any of your claims and that this was rediculous. I destroyed your keys to these ships and they will just stay where ever they are forever.
Anyhow there's still a thing left i want to tell you. I don't need any revenge or anything, it's not worth it, because it will happen all alone, whithout me doing anything. And if you have any problems with Cria, just deal with them, or ask your girlfriend, wife, or whatever she is, to help you. Whatever you try to tell me or what you try doing to me, I won't help you with that one, you have to do that yourself, also because cria can not be influenced and you should know that wery well.
I don't want to have any problems between you and me either. But the thing i want the most is that you just leave me alone. I don't want to have to do anything with you anymore, that's all.

You see nothing special. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Venus; Concourse Alpha; Landing Zone and Level 1 Center.

13:35 A mauve card with a kitten border
Tibo,
I love you more than anyone or anything in this Universe. I don't want you to go, to disappear nor do I want to leave you.
I'm so sorry for accusing you of abuse. It just struck me so odd
that all of a sudden we successfully got rid of the Muzati and the
otono and then you were cold towards me. I felt hurt and baffled
when I thought I had done the best I knew how to and only wanted to
bea a team player. Yes you mentioned about how you had used a
certain method in the sim. Well Love, this is wonderful but you
never once asked me, would you try this or let's walk through this
method so we're on the same page or anything. You just assumed
things in that you accused me of overriding your preference when I
was not even aware that you wanted me to do things your way in the
first place. So what I meant about abuse was if you become angry
towards me for not picking up on what you want me to do and then
have a justification of your chosing, then that would be, in my own
humble opinion, rather mean-spirited. So I apologize for saying that you were abusive. You know Tibo, I truly want to please you, to do whatever you prefer and above all, I respect it that it's your ship we're in. I would hope though, that since we are married and a union, that even in my ships, that you would know that I give you more leaway than I would anyone else to do things in the manner that you prefer because I do respect you as i've seen you become a very capable pilot. I don't think it should be a matter of it's just 'my ship' either. even though the ship is owned by me, whereever we dwell or co-exist together should be ours and not just mine. Still, it goes without saying, that I love you and I want to please you and to honor your preferences. All you had to do was just say to me that you would like it if I would try this other method or at least ask me if I would be comfortable trying it. I probably would have initially said no but I'd try it in a simulator first or if we could try it with a BZZR or such or even an unknown where we're not shooting at the ship. I do want to do things more efficiently and to minimize risks as well. So no Love I don't think you are not worthwhile because of a situation like this but I just felt that if you were going to continue to treat me this way everytime i mis-understood or didn't do things exactly the way you wanted that you would turn this coldly towards me, that I truly felt as though I wanted to escape. I do truly want to work this out though Love. This is not worth your disappearing out into deep space at all either. It works both ways too. If you want to throw away what we have worked hard to achieve, and do this, then I can't stop you but it is telling me that I'm not enough for you I suppose which makes me sadder than you can ever imagine. I feel like such a failure when you say things like this because our vows
13:35  do state that we should work through our challenges and not run away from them.
As for the Bard and such, if you had of just ignored what i suggested, I wouldn't have been totally comfortable. Still, I do respect it that it's your ship and I would have just shrugged it off and if your bard got low and we had to spend a lot of time hunting down friendlies to barter with, then so be it. If we managed with what you had provisioned, then guess what! you would have proved me wrong which certainly wouldn't have made me angry at all! I actually thought you would have only added another 1500 bard in the first place. All this to say that you do have the right to do things the way you want and in my mind, I would have just gone along with your decision even though I wasn't totally comfortable with it and the reason is that I do respect your choice even though I might not always agree with you. If I was right in the end, I wouldn't make anything of it as I'd just consider it to have been a learning experience for you if I was right and for me, if you were right. So nobody is at fault here at all.
I love you,
Katrianne

13:41 Amore,
During the trip that Kitty and I took out of locals to get her ship, we had plenty of time to talk about her and my relationship in the past. I won't go into very many details, but we did discuss something that you might be interested in.
During many discussions, I have expressed to Kitty that I am a very affectionate and flirtatious person. She understands this and also knows that many of her and my issues in the past arose because of lack of communication between her and me. Anyways, I did tell her that some time ago, you did ask me regarding participation in a threesome or foursome. I did explain to her that the foursome was in case she and I were together.
She expressed that what made her uncomfortable was the fact that she has not had an opportunity to get to know you. She has no desire to do anything that would hurt your relationship with Matt. She also reiterated that she wishes not to be touched sexually by another woman. I assured her that you did not have a desire to be intimate with her. So, in order for Kitty to feel comfortable enough to consider such an activity or arrangement, she would need to have some social interaction with you. 
If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to talk to either of us.
Sincerely,
Tibo

Dear tibo My Love! I am so sad ... I know I had left my kids and robots in your trannie but here I noticed you had left. I initially thought you just went out for work ... then I saw my things in the garage. I didn't think much of it but I went over to Acrylon to look around in your trannie for some other things that I knew were still in there and I noticed that i no longer have a key! Pray to the stars ... what is wrong? What did I do for you to just leave me like this? I also checked the keys to the apartment and noticed yours was gone so I guess you threw that away? I then noticed you've deleted our private link and you're not allowing me to track you anymore. I know what I said the other day may have seemingly been hurtful towards you. I honestly meant nothing towards you at all. I just meant that I am so fed-up with the heavy-handed tactics of others. I would hate to be a new pilot these days, just trying to make a few credits and everytime they try to launch, they are hurled into a mine field and lose everything. I can afford it but they can't. I just find it painful to observe this going on day after day and my first inclination is to run away from all of this madness! You know too, I didn't say I would leave right away as I wanted you to have the opportunity to do more work and to decide if you truly wanted to go with me. I am enclosing another key to the apartment. You are still welcome anytime even if you don't wan
13:43 t to stay with me. I love you Tibo, more than you will ever know. Please come back ... oh please do come back. If you just can't, please then, I believe I do deserve an explanation as to why I was all of a sudden abandoned by the man who I consider to be the most awesome man in the Universe. I love you Tibo. - Kitty

Tibo,
you have to understand that I am a rather private person. What you said in that mis-com was a bit insightful in that you were saying something to cause Amore to be judgemental by saying 'kitty is refusing thus far'. You only brought up being friends this evening and I never refused that so that's not being fair don't you think? I jus feel that if friends are there to help us both then they should be mutual friends and I don't consider Amore to be a mutual friend as she has not done anything but communicate with just you. Therefore, she is only hearing just your side of the issues. So all you had to say when I asked the first time that you request that amore stay out of our affairs, then you could have come back and said that she was encouraging you to work with me. Then I would certainly be more trusting of her motives. In truth, we do have to be best friends too if we're going to grow into another phase. Friends trust one another and friends have your back. Lovers don't always have those qualities. If all that I can have with you is friendship, then I am willing to be that even though I won't stop loving you. I will just have to keep my feelings to myself. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy sex though as you don't have to love me to have sex with me. I enjoy it with you so I'm willing to accept your sudden change of heart.
As for traveling out to get our ships, I will be very grateful to have your assistance. Also, I am
13:45  still willing to do additional traveling to help you earn more artifacting points and your Radio Receiver components. I have traveled before with friends and I do enjoy working with you in this respect.
Your friend,
Kitty

13:54 Give what to who?

13:54 Jenaia the droid

13:54 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.

13:57 ["Finish Them" Weapons Room 3]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

13:57 You peer north and see...

13:57 ["Finish Them" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a plush misty silver leather captain's chair, a high royal white leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a plaid platinum medical drone, a plaid platinum security drone, Tara the droid, and Jaden the droid here.
You see Quintavious Thomas here.
You can go south and out.

13:58 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:58 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:58 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:58 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:58 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:58 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:58 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:58 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:58 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:58 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:58 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:58 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:20 ["Finish Them" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a soft royal silver woven engineer's chair here.
You see Caterina Winbush (sitting on a soft royal silver woven engineer's chair) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

16:40 The exterior of this drone is spherical and mostly smooth. The contiguous outer shell is marred only by a number of small fins and grills, apparently intended to help the drone stay afloat or to cool the inner workings. Four smaller holes are placed at even intervals around the drone's body, presumably used for firing stun or counterstun shots. There is no evident sensory system, though a panel at the top of the drone seems to be used for the loading or unloading of ammunition.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

21:13 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:13 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

21:13 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:13 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:13 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:13 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

21:15 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, and a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub] (indoors)
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Docking Bay.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, a small turquoise glass end table, a rainbow-colored wicker coffee table,

22:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:41 Katrianne Beauchene presses some buttons on a destination finder.

22:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:42 Katrianne Beauchene presses a series of buttons on the FTL control console.

22:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:18 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at "Fascination" Docking Bay.
You see a metallic red starship simulator and an internal stun turret here.
You can go down and out.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Enchanting Melody", the eight-person gunship "Praelor Demolish Enterprize", the five-person transverser "Blue Star", and the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 3967" landed here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
