01:48:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white socks and a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, and a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

02:09:58 You are carrying nothing.

02:10:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:10:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:10:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:10:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:25:33 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:25:37 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:25:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:25:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:25:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:26:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:26:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:26:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:26:11 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

10:46:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

12:01:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:01:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:01:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:01:49 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

12:01:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:02:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:02:19 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am in the lounge."

12:02:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:02:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:02:33 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

12:02:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:02:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:02:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:02:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

12:02:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:02:37 You exit the ship.

12:02:37 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The four-person star liner "Flight Of Angels", the two-person light transport "Jack Of All Trades", the four-person mule "Lion's Den", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

12:02:38 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go out.

12:02:40  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a stormy pair of trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, and a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

12:02:40 You are carrying nothing.

12:02:49 You hold Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into your group.

12:02:51 You say, "Thanks."

12:02:53 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

12:02:53 You can go up.
Kim Saunders followed you.

12:02:59 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Airlock]

12:02:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Kim Saunders followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:03:01 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

12:03:01 You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.
Kim Saunders followed you.

12:03:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:03:05 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:03:06 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:03:07 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:03:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:03:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:03:21 The ship is already moving.

12:03:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:03:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon B-24. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:03:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:03:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

12:03:26 Kim Saunders strides up.

12:03:27 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:03:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:03:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:03:30 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:03:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-24."

12:03:32 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:03:33 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

12:03:33 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.

12:03:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:03:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:03:38 You peer up...

12:03:38 
[Starship "Striking Distance"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling gray leather gunner's chair, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
Kim Saunders is lying down.
You can go south and down.

12:03:39 Via general sector communication, Beacon B-24 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Striking Distance.' Welcome to Beacon B-24."

12:03:42 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

12:03:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

12:07:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:07:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:08:02 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:08:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:08:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:08:05 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:08:06 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

12:08:07 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:08:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:08:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:08:10 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:08:11 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "It's ok. I didn't respond as quickly as I could too."

12:08:13 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Striking Distance! Welcome to home space!"

12:08:14 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:08:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

12:08:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:08:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:08:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:08:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Striking Distance. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:08:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:08:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:08:46 You are credited with 234,375.00 AEU credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

12:08:48 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:08:48 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:08:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:08:55 Kim Saunders strides in from above.

12:09:01 You hug Kim Saunders.

12:09:03 You say, "Thanks."

12:09:19 Kim Saunders smiles at you. "Well, welcome back as our SDC again."

12:09:20 Your ship 'Striking Distance' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:09:26 Kim Saunders hugs you.

12:09:27 You say, "Thanks."

12:09:28 You grin.

12:09:40 Kim Saunders waves. "See you later."

12:09:43 You wave.

12:09:44 Kim Saunders strides out.

12:09:45 You say, "See ya."

12:09:49 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Airlock]

12:09:49 You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:09:50 You exit the ship.

12:09:50 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go up.

12:09:51 Some lights on the scout "White Eagle" flash as Kim Saunders boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

12:09:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

12:09:52 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:09:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

12:09:52 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

12:09:53 Board what?

12:09:55 Board what?

12:09:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:31:58 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

13:32:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello."

13:32:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey."

13:32:36 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "HI HI."

13:38:25 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

13:40:25 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

13:56:25 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

13:57:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule, is there some way to gauge how long a rift trip is going to be?"

13:57:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Without committing to it?"

13:57:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not really."

14:00:25 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

14:01:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Johann posted about inserters for 777."

14:02:05 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Morning."

14:02:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh good. I didn't see that."

14:02:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

14:02:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where do I catch those?"

14:02:25 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

14:03:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess that's something I could look at on the org temporary structure terminal."

14:03:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "They're part of the accelerator. So just go where you normally would go and if the inserter is there and you need it, it will work."

14:03:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, usually it's part of the accelerator."

14:03:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I guess I forgot that those things were different."

14:04:23 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Afternoon, Hakeem."

14:04:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do inserters do?"

14:05:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It allows ships that don't have a rift drive to utilize the rift. It inserts the ship into the rift since the ship doesn't have a rift drive to do it."

14:06:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, what are accelerators, then?"

14:06:16 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Any interest on a nest?"

14:06:25 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would do a nest, for sure."

14:06:50 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "What suit you have Constantine?"

14:07:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

14:07:08 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "AEU or EAOS 2."

14:07:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Accelerators help by putting the ship further into the rift which in turn, increases the rift flow and accelerates the ship."

14:07:25 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Jacob?"

14:07:39 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I can run anything tier 2, or a League 3."

14:08:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That makes sense."

14:09:29 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "One minute."

14:10:15 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "OK, Jacob LEague 3, Constantine EAOS, I will take a rental 2 and Ted and AEU, chet please in a couple of minutes."

14:10:52 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Copy that, on my way."

14:16:26 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

14:35:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who's this Sol Sterling on comms?"

14:35:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see him every once in a while."

14:38:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

14:43:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:45:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "He's been around for a little while... He's interesting... I don't really get along with him very well."

14:46:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But I have to go for now. I'll see you later."

14:46:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "He's not part of any alliance pilot corps, is that right?"

14:46:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah okay, have a good one."

14:46:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "He used to be League I believe, but now he's rogued. And thanks."

14:50:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is the rift accelerator to 777 in Mir because Mir is the closest sector with a permanent beacon to 777?"

14:50:38 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I'm thinking so."

14:51:06 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So it would stand to reason that, if I wanted to use my rift drive to get to 777, I would also want to start from Mir."

14:51:09 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can't remember why it was moved there, I guess that was the reason."

14:51:22 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Yes."

14:51:27 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You wouldn't have an accelerator then though."

14:51:41 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hmm... Good point."

14:51:47 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, so using the inserter would be faster?"

14:51:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Always."

14:51:57 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Battle of mir? Yeah that's where it is, but it took me almost 2 hours to get out here."

14:52:01 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, this is great to know."

14:52:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No, not Battle of Mir, Mir, that's why it took you so long."

14:52:16 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "If you come out, I went south."

14:52:30 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez laughs.

14:52:33 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Kerry, the Station is in mir, not battle of Mir."

14:52:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I just said that."

14:52:42 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Holi smokes."

14:52:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I made the same mistake yesterday Kerry, I tried rifting from Battle of Mir and was frustrated with the time and turned around."

14:53:10 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well, Rogue and I did it like twice before we realized our mistake."

14:53:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You guys need to keep up with the message boards."

14:53:19 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Was not really listening, I was space walking."

14:53:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do read them, I just didn't understand the distinction."

14:53:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But now I do."

14:53:37 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Ah, fair play."

14:54:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:54:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,030,429.01 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

14:55:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And that's how you know."

14:56:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

14:57:07 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Heh, scan."

14:57:12 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Urm."

14:57:18 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Nothing here."

14:57:23 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt chuckles.
