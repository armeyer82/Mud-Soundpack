The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

Got to know things about you and genuinely started to develop...Something besides sexual attraction for you...Well. That's different. But I think it's hard when we never get to spend time together except a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there between missions. So I'm not sure what you're looking for out of the closeness with me and I'm not suggesting that you thought I was a slut. Or even that us going to bed was ever an option. I'm just trying to understand more about what this is."

Because you said that you guys agreed that if you got to know another couple, as if what you're specifically looking for is a couple you like and respect, not one person or another person but a couple. So I'm just trying to understand what you're saying."

   (7:38 p.m.) [Private | Moiraine Yobi] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "I understand that. And of course that would be the priority. To make sure that everybody felt safe and confident that their primary relationship were being respected, and so on."

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a shiny silver starship simulator, three translu
22:41 cent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, a translucent architectural design simulator, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, Kissy the droid, a hologram of a beach sunset projected on one wall, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, Kitcat the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, a red handheld planetary surveyor, and an orange and white cat here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras

You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

23:02 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, an antique gold wedding band engraved with intertwining hearts, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.

A sharply descending slope leads into the near side of one of the many craters dotting the planet. On one side is a gray rock wall, and on the other, a drop-off into the impenetrable darkness of the crater. The path you are on is only about two feet wide, and the edge is jagged.

The surface steeply rises for quite a distance straight ahead. The solid surface of gray rock underfoot is littered with tiny smaller pebbles which make the climb difficult. This rising section of rock extends far to either side, however, the drop off at either end looks to be quite sudden and dramatic.

The path you have been traveling has been descending for some time until finally; it flattens out at the bottom of a small crater. The rough gray rock looms tall on either side, blocking out most of the light present on the planetary surface. The floor of the basin is nearly pitch black, making navigation a near impossibility.

A sloping narrow path between two boulders is the only way forward. The path is draped in shadows and darkness, and the rough rock to either side presses in close. Due to the lack of light, it is impossible to tell what lies further along the path, or indeed, where it may lead.
