00:08 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a pair of brown leather tennis shoes, and a pair of multi colored clogs here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a medium bright purple antique rug, a cherry wood table, an enormous purple beanbag chair, a pink starship simulator, a mat white wooden hanging planter, and a multicolor striped beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

01:21 A pink handheld planetary surveyor

01:21 This small, sleek device features a single trigger and a small display which presents the numbers of scans currently in memory. The display indicates that 80 rooms have been scanned. You estimate that to be worth 16,000,000.00 credits and 4 points.

01:21 The hatch acknowledges your key and unlocks, allowing you to stroll through.

01:21 ("Mischief" Control Room) A chime sounds, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

You can go enter and out.

01:21 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:21 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Beginning cycling."

01:21 ("Mischief" Control Room) You hear the airlock begin cycling.
A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard entering the airlock.

01:21 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

01:21 ("Mischief" Control Room) You hear the airlock finish cycling.

You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a purple velvet artifact storage container, Mekensie the droid, Kalista the droid, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, a finch-patterned refrigerator, and a printout of the service record for "Mischief" here.
You can go south, down, and out.

01:21 You begin the launch sequence.

01:21 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:21 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:21 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:21 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Planet 284932.

01:21 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:22 There are no damaged components.

01:23 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:23 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

A path you have been following for some time finally levels off to a large flat area scattered with large brown boulders.

01:28 [Planet 284932] (outdoors) (hostile environment)
A path you have been following for some time finally levels off to a large flat area scattered with large brown boulders. The chunks of rock loom ten feet high at the tallest, and cast deep shadows over the already gloomy ground. There are narrow paths wending their way through the rocks, but the lack of light makes spotting them difficult.
You can go west, southeast, and northwest.

After gently rising for some time, the rock underfoot levels off at the lip of a wide crater stretching into the distance. The giant rend in the planet yawns before you, its black depths cloaked in darkness. The rim of the crater turns sharply away here.
You can go southeast and northwest.

A sloping narrow path between two boulders is the only way forward. The path is draped in shadows and darkness, and the rough rock to either side presses in close. Due to the lack of light, it is impossible to tell what lies further along the path, or indeed, where it may lead.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simu

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

03:56 ["Mischief" Engineering Room] (indoors)
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a medium bright purple antique rug, a cherry wood table, an enormous purple beanbag chair, a pink starship simulator, a mat white wooden hanging planter, a multicolor striped beanbag chair, and an orange and white cat here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled

The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.
