["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a velvet-covered teak captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

Alliances
--------------------------------------------------
Commonwealth of Free Spirits (Commonwealth)
The Commonwealth is an alliance of people who prefer peace over violence, though they will not hesitate to use violence if it is absolutely necessary. While they are not as advanced as Hale, the Commonwealth has produced a number of impressive technological devices, including a layer of armor that is capable of absorbing partial laser blasts and converting them to energy for the starship's systems. In present times, however, a group within the Commonwealth has begun to use intimidation and violence to accomplish their goals, leading some to believe that the alliance as a whole has shifted it's beliefs, though this is a false assumption.

The Hale Collective (Hale)
The Hale Collective is an alliance devoted solely to scientific endeavors, which obviously puts them well ahead of the other alliances in terms of specialty technology. It is not uncommon for a Hale starship to do something completely unexpected, such as disappearing from sensors or traveling great distances in extremely short amounts of time. It's even rumored that Hale scientists have developed what is called a chaos bolt, which witnesses claim wreaks havoc on a starship's systems. While the existance of a chaos bolt has not been proven, there is no doubt that Hale technology makes the alliance rather formidable.

Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists
03:27  (AIE)
The AIE is most well known for its discovery of Miriani, the first planet to be colonized by humans. Members of the AIE are explorers at heart, often taking starships into uncharted space with no specific destination in mind, enjoying the freedom that comes from traveling to distant parts of the galaxy.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

12:45 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

12:45 You peer south and see...

12:45 ["Mischief" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, though it contains no information of value in its unpowered state. The room is eerily silent without any of the ship's systems being powered. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a medium bright purple antique rug, a cherry wood table, an enormous purple beanbag chair, a pink starship simulator, a mat white wooden hanging planter, and a multicolor striped beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet.

Intraship Quick Messaging Network
--------------------------------------------------
The Intraship Quick Messaging Network (IQMN) is an add-on for the RAVEN system that allows those aboard the ship to send and receive very short messages to one another. The system operates entirely by voice, so privacy is not guaranteed if somebody happens to be in the same room. To get started, you must first purchase a RAVEN upgrade and summon it to the room with the RAVEN command. The computer will then accept a variety of voice commands to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages. These commands are outlined below:

  Check my messages.
This will alert you if you have any pending messages.

  Read my messages.
This will read every pending message to you at once.

  Read my messages from <person>.
This will read every message you have received from <person>.

  Read my next message. (or just next message)
This will read the next pending message.

  Compose a message to <person>.
This will compose a new short message to be delivered to <person>.


It's worth reiterating that these commands are INTRASHIP, so they will not allow the sending of messages to other ships. You can only leave messages for a person on the ship you're currently in. This does not, however, mean that you can't leave messages for people who aren't on the ship at the time. You can leave a message for any player on your ship and they can check
13:53  it the next time they're on board. Also worth noting is that the IQMN is a separate upgrade to the RAVEN system. You will require both a RAVEN upgrade AND an IQMN upgrade.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

Tradesman Object Permissions
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Tradesman objects can be very time-consuming to create, often involving hours of unique creative work. It can be unsettling when you've worked so hard to create an item only to find that somebody else has created an exact duplicate without your consent. For this reason, controls exist that allow you to lock your unique tradesman items and prevent other people from creating exact duplicates.

  Usage
The TRADESMAN-OPTIONS command will allow you to configure the permissions on the items you own. This command allows you to configure two things: A global permission and more fine-grained per-item lockouts.

Global: The global setting will apply to all of your current and future tradesman items that do not have a custom setting applied. This is the setting that gets used when no other setting can be found.
Per-Object: You can override the global setting on a per-object basis. The menu allows you to select the object you want to configure and then presents you with three choices: Allow, Deny, and Global. When you choose allow, anybody can duplicate that object. Similarly, with deny, nobody can duplicate that object. Both of these options will supercede the global setting. Finally, you can choose global. This will reset the individual object's setting and cause it to revert back to being controlled by your global setting.

  Cav
21:17 eats
There are some exceptions to the control exercised by the TRADESMAN-OPTIONS command. If your tradesman object is a general-purpose object (or what we might refer to as a 'generic'), it's understood that there will be children created that mimic its behavior. Objects like this may be things like slime launchers, scent pellets, squirtguns, etc. Typically only the behavior of those objects is copied and not any specific creative work. For instance, you may have created the first scent pellet. We would use your pellet as a template for future pellets (e.g. the behavior of throwing a pellet and having it infest another player with a foul smell). What it does not copy, however, would be custom scents that may have been applied.

Also, unfortunately, these controls can only be applied to automatic systems (such as an object duplication lab) and host commands. There is very little we can do if somebody manually reconstructs your object in a tradesman request. Your best bet in that instance would be to ASSIST.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Lore Computer
--------------------------------------------------
Lore computers are small devices that can be extraordinarily helpful. They feature a memo program for writing, reading, and transferring text files, optical character recognition for scanning signs into your computer, a scratch pad for quick notes, a unit converter, a calculator, a tracking system, a shopping guide, a news uplink, and a variety of other functions. Operating a Lore computer is extremely simple, and there are a number of options available. It's best to just use the computer and try the various functions for yourself. However, to get you started, here are some explanations of the available hardware and software.

  Hardware
Lore computers come with several hardware slots as well as hardware expansion cards. To load a card, you simply type LOAD [card name]. To remove a card, you merely UNLOAD [Lore Computer Name].

Translink - A TransLink expansion card will enable you to perform two additional functions with your Lore computer.  First, it will enable you to enter the Lore ID of other Lore computers you'd like to let track the location of your Lore computer.  Second, it will allow you to track Lore computers of people who have authorized you to do so.  Please note this will only track the Lore computer and not it's owner so if the two should ever become separated, your results may not be what you expect. Furthermore, Loretech Industries bares no responsibility for anything that goes wrong as a result of tracking people.

Character Recognition -  A Character Recognition expansion card will enable your Lore computer to scan a document and then allow you to import it as a file onto your lore computer. You will have the opportunity to give the file a name after the scan is completed.

Printer - A Printer expansion card will enable your Lore computer to make printed hard copies of documents saved in it's memory.  Due to the wonders of Loretech technology, the printer is rated for over 1 trillion prints before needing replacement.

Biometric Scanner - A Biometric Scanner expansion card will provide additional security for your Lore computer.  It will allow you to take biometric readings of anyone in the same location as you to provide them access to your lore computer should they become in possession of it.  Anyone that is not in the biometric scanners database will be denied access to your system. If, for some reason, the biometric card should be removed without first clearing the stored identities, your Lore computer will be locked down until a biometric card is inserted again.

Speech Synthesis - A Speech Synthesis expansion card will enable you to command your Lore computer to output, in a synthesized voice, anything you write on the Lore computer's scratchpad.  This output will be visible to anyone in the same location as you.

Holographic Imager - This card allows you to take detailed images of a room, an object, or a group of objects. When prompted for a target, type group to choose who to include in an image. Once an image has been taken, you can access it from your Lore's holographic image album. After loading blank discs, you can also copy the data to a disc that will function similarly to a standard photograph, with one important exception: You can look at the individual objects in every picture. Simply LOOK <object name> IN <picture name> to look at anything that was present at the time the picture was taken.

Image Data Extractor - An image extractor allows a Lore computer to download the data from an image disc and import it into their photo album.

  Software
The Lore computer also comes with several useful software programs which enable you to perform a variety of functions.

File Management (Memopad) - The file management function allows you to create and store text documents. The interface is fairly straightforward, allowing you to add files and folders as well as edit, delete, or transfer them from one person to another. Anything you scan with the OCR card will end up in the file management.

Sundial - The sundial simply displays the current date and time.

Scratch Pad - The scratch pad is a place to quickly jot down notes. Once you finish writing a note, you can show it to somebody else in the room, print it to a file, or, if available, output the text to your speech synthesizer card to have it read to everybody in the room.

Calculator - The calculator allows you to quickly and easily enter equations into your Lore computer and receive the result. If you wish to perform multiple related calculations, you may use the # character to substitute with the value from your last equation. 

Examples: 
(5+5) * 8
The result of your equation, 80.0, briefly appears on the display.
5 + 5 * 8
The result of your equation, 45.0, briefly appears on the display.
35 + #
The result of your equation, 80.0, briefly appears on the display.

Unit Converter
The unit converter allows you to convert a number from one type to another. For detailed instructions on using the unit converter, select the option on your Lore menu and type HELP.

Tracking 
If you have a Translink card, your Lore computer is capable both of tracking and being tracked. Be aware, however, that you will be unable to track Lore computers that are travelling through wormholes or out of communications range.

Shopping Guide
The shopping guide is perhaps the most used function of the Lore computer. It automatically pulls data from stores in realtime to find the items you want. It can list every store category at once, list only upgrades, or it can search by string. There are a few limitations, especially with repeating items, but for the most part the shopping guide is an extremely valuable resource.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a 
22:49 transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a bright turquoise cooler, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a pink handheld planetary surveyor here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
