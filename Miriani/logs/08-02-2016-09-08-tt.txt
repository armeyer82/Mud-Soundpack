Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

I seem to remember a changelog from quite a while back stating that operating
battlesuits with some significant injury would not be very effective. I can not
remember whether a similar thing was done for starships.

Operating battlesuits while injured does have penalties! Not so much starships,
though.

Module Transports:
Four-Person Accord Space Module Transport 20000000.00 (AFW Command)
AFW SPACE MODULE TRANSPORT
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 20 industry points      0 combat points
Model number: AFW-063                   Designation: Accord Space Module
Transport
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 160
This ship will allow you to move around temporary space station modules and
position them properly so that you can create a temporary space structure in the
sector of your choice. Despite being a light cruiser, this vessel does not have
a docking bay, replacing the dockin bay with the module bay. It can hold up to
28 temporary space station modules.
Two-Person Accord Space Module Scout 20,000,000.00 (AFW Command)
AFW SPACE MODULE SCOUT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 20 industry points        300 exploration points
Model number: AFW-071                   Designation: Accord Space Module Scout
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 4000         Standard battery hours: 20
Docking bay size required: 60
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
This ship, though smaller than its cousin and able to fit only seven temporary
space station modules has two hours more charge, and also has an exploration
point requirement. Even with this exploration point requirement however, it does
not seem like this ship has exploration-grade sensors, and cannot be fitted with
an impeller upgrade.
AC-2X SPACE CONSTRUCTOR 100,000,000.00 (Aenea)
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 2500 industry points
Model number: AC-2X                     Designation: Space Constructor
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 10000        Standard battery hours: 12
Docking bay size required: 225
This vessel is able to hold 28 temporary space station modules, just like the
module transport. However, this particular design which is currently only
available to the AEU, has the added benefits of not needing space lifters at all
for temporary station construction. This is because you can construct the
temporary stations from inside the docking bay, and thenjust push the station
itself out when you need to. It appears that you can have more than one
temporary station constructed and ready for deployment in the module bay at any
given time, but the modules used in the construction will still count towards
the module bay's total limit.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The advantage to a carrier though of
course as you can dock a larger trade ship and a combat ship or a trade ship and
a module transporter."

Carrier Starships:
There are many different ships that have docking bays, and all can carry up to
certain ship classes. I will only list on this page starships that are actually
purposed to be carriers more than anything else. Note: carrier starships
currently cannot hold ships such as cruisers and module transports.
Five-Person Hyperion Security Tactical Deployment Vessel 40,000,000.00
(Hyperion)
HX-7 HYPERION CORPORATE SECURITY TACTICAL DEPLOYMENT VESSEL
Class: Gunship
Requirements: 250 industry points       100 combat points
Model number: HX-7                      Designation: Hyperion Security Tactical
Deployment Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 6                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 16
Docking bay size required: 112.5           Docking bay capacity: 75
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
I invision this ship as one that can hold its own as long as it takes for it to
jump into a sector and deploy smaller starcraft to fight in a battle. Each
weapons room has only two turrets in it, so it should not be used for a long
fight. It cannot hold as many ships as the carrier, due to its smaller number of
available docking units.
Four-Person Light Carrier 150,000,000.00 (Drydock)
CMY-96 COALITION LIGHT CARRIER
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 500 industry points       350 combat points
Model number: CMY-96                    Designation: Light Carrier
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 2000         Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 150          Docking bay capacity: 100
This ship can dock almost every type of ship into its abnormally large docking
bay, right up to and including gunship-class vessels.
Two-Person Tugboat 10,000,000.00 (AFW Command)
AFW ACCORD STANDARD TUGBOAT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 0 industry points         0 combat points
Model number: AFW-044                   Designation: Tugboat
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 8000         Standard battery hours: 6
Docking bay size required: 12.5
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110~%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95~%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
The tugboat doesn't have a docking bay to hold ships in, but it can tow a ship
to most desired destinations, enabling them to even travel through a wormhole
while they are being towed. Note: ships tugged by your boat do not follow you
into the riftflow, don't waste your credits. Tugged ships will also not follow
you if you move between sectors via a reactionless drive either manually or
using autovector.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

teal is green and blue cancelled by vermillion
sienna is green and red

If the glyph at the door flashes black, we cancel it. If white, we match it. So
if we get a red one, it'll flash black, flash a blue and a yellow. If we get an
indigo that flashes white, we first make a violet glyph, then a blue one. If
that indigo flashes black, we cancel it by making a saffron glyph (make an
orange glyph, then add yellow).

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Providence Station; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking
bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very
well built and maintained station.
The one-person cargo hauler "Moonlighter2Z", the Devastating Effect rescue pod,
and the four-person mule "Lidia's Pride" are landed here.
You can go northeast and northwest.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully

Many pilots have approached me with complaints regarding batteries and how they
can know that a battery is good for them. Since a battery is such a vital
component to a ship's functioning at maximum efficiency, I will take the time to
talk about them in detail in this section.
The battery has three things that a pilot should look at. The overall efficiency
is the battery's charge. The higher the overall efficiency is, the greater your
ship charge will be.
Combat grid usage is how much of a battery will be used to recharge a combat
grid. The higher the combat grid usage is, the slower the grid will actually
recharge.
Wormhole drive usage is the amount of charge from a battery the wormhole drive
uses to make a jump point. The higher the wormhole drive usage is, the more
power a ship will use from the ship's batteries. For example, 250% will use
approximately 12 minutes of ship charge to make a wormhole jump.
Finally, we have maximum engine speed. It's not as some people believe, how fast
the ship will go when it's at full speed, but more how fast the ship will start
moving if it has an engine that has the same instantaneous velocity of a
battery's max engine speed. The instantaneous velocity of your ship will be the
instantaneous velocity of the slower component, whether that is the battery or
the engine.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The tier 1 scout is
geared only for really short-range exploration trips, since it only lasts a
couple days tops. Most of the planetary systems are very very far away to the
point where you might be able to survey one or two."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Then my next choice
would be the void piercer, right?"
tra 1 Yeah, but what Ather is right.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, but what
Ather is right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "The void
piercer..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You will never hear
me recommend the void piercer for anything short of bait."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "The capsole you
cna't get out of and it has a rift drive alread installed on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The Void Piercer won't
offer much more in terms of available range."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "T I just got denied
for an arrow, so I'm kind of out of options as far as AEU ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Work hard at it.
I'm sure you'll get approved."
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly
while dancing around it.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup work hard at it and
the best option we have for long range without an applicaiton ship is a tactical
platform configured for Exploration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "That application
confuses me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Okay platform, so
put a rift on it, the right battery, the surveyer, and I don't think it could
handle the blast chamber."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh why not I have one
on mine!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "A blast chamber?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Of course."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Qe come unit,
artifact detctor, oh gosh, so many upgrades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It is the Tactical
platform available from Long Term Rentals on Helios."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "I have one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Then you will need 3
Luxury sightseers to attach to it which will provide the exploration sensors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "How do you get
those?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Whare would you get
those to put on it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "From Hermes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Do those ships have
to be upgraded."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That's your option."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Anything special
besides that that I need to know?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "And how do you
attach them to the platform?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm rather tied up at
the moment but again it's up to you and you can review the information in the
upgrades book."
A medium-sized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a
chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "And batteries?"
tra 1 In order to attach them, you'll need to do it in space.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "In order to attach
them, you'll need to do it in space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "I saw that in the
book. But 3 of them?"
tra 1 Yep.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "And what else do you
attach to them?"
tra 1 Nothing, just the tac platform and the three sightseers. Then get all the
upgrades, including the rift drive and all that.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Nothing, just the
tac platform and the three sightseers. Then get all the upgrades, including the
rift drive and all that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Nice! The E-sync
battery on this one too?"
tra 1 Yeah, it's the one that maximizes your battery.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, it's the one
that maximizes your battery."
tra 1 Giving you the most charge.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Giving you the most
charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Dead on."
tra 1 It's rather difficult to attach the sightsers to the tac platform by
yourself.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's rather
difficult to attach the sightsers to the tac platform by yourself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Could I get some
assistance with that, as I"m about to buy all 3 of them. And what about the one
that requires aproavle?"
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
tra 1 You can apply for the ones that require approval and they can be used, but
you can only apply for one ship at a time. I'd help, but I can't do it right
now.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You can apply for
the ones that require approval and they can be used, but you can only apply for
one ship at a time. I'd help, but I can't do it right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Do you need the
one's that require an application."
tra 1 You do not.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You do not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "Well, just let me
know when you can help. That wil be the first thing I do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "And I appreciate
it."
A short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

a small bubbling white-lit aquarium containing crimson and blue aquatic life and

This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is closed.
Inside it you see a black plastic undersea castle and a small plastic statue of
a bikini-clad mermaid.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and violet round wings, a
tiny startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet split wings, a tiny
startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet butterfly-like wings,
and a tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and amethyst round
wings are living in it.
That's four creatures, and the tank could probably safely hold one more.

Board what?
l
[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.

Destroyers:
Three-Person Light Escort 15,000,000.00 (New Earth Blazing Trails)
AS-0A AEU LIGHT ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 50 industry points        15 combat points
Model number: AS-0A                     Designation: Light Escort
Turret hardpoints: 10                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The light Escort is the first destroyer that an AEU pilot will ever have access
to. It's a reasonably well armed vessel, with no major bonuses. However, it can
still pack quite a punch, especially with more advanced upgrades and its single
launcher.
Three-Person Heavy Defense Vessel 7,500,000.00 (Endymion)
AD-1N AEU HEAVY DEFENSE VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 100 industry points       250 combat points
Model number: AD-1N                     Designation: Heavy Defense Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The defense vessel is a very well armed vessel, holding 12 turrets. It does have
a major disadvantage though, which likely also explains the cheaper cost. That
disadvantage is that it has no FTL drive. However, it can still be a very useful
ship, but just know if you want to take it anywhere you'll need to dock it
inside a bigger ship, or tug it around using a tugboat.
Three-Person Clipper 200,000,000.00 (New Earth Allied Technologies)
AS-4F AEU CLIPPER-CLASS ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 750 industry points       750 combat points
Model number: AS-4F                     Designation: Clipper
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 14
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The Clipper is the most advanced destroyer that the AEU has. It's as armed as
the defense vessel with 12 turrets, but has the further advantage of a vastly
increased engine speed when it's going at maximum burn, and also has an extra
hull failsafe over the other two destroyers.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Long-term rentals:
The fighter and heavy bomber listed in this section are generally similar to the
ones rented at Tannhauser, save for the fact that I'm pretty sure they start out
with stock upgrades and have to be upgraded by the long-term renter. The modular
tactical platform and the Modular Terrorerotici both can only have
corporation-based fighters such as the hyperion ships or the ones rented either
short-term or long-term by Agnar attached to them as far as we've deduced, as
well as the shuttles manufactured by corporations such as Hermes or United. You
can attach the ships to the platforms only from space. Note: the docking bay
size of the tactical platform and the Terrorerotici will increase depending on
the types of ships you have attached to them.

If you want to own a six-person ship to do stuff in and don't quite qualify for
the Pincer, then this ship is for you! It has fewer weapons, but would be able
to perform well enough in a fight with decent upgrades. It does however require
you to fill out an application, and approval or denial notifications may take
some time to reach you, but you'll be notified by mail regardless.

[Starship "Fireproof"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

[Starship "Explorer 3"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to

[Starship "War Crimes"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a busted decryogenesis device, a fuzzy stuffed eel, and Nova the little

Cesar Ysidro (RATS Nanite Reinforcer)
This is a strangely organic-looking battlesuit of shades of black and gray. It
resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A rounded cockpit encases the
pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of
hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A laser attachment is
mounted to the right wrist. A nanite replicator with a small targeting laser is
mounted to the right forearm. A wide-dispersal nanite replicator is mounted to
the left forearm.
It appears to be 0% damaged.

You peer out...
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
two-person Accord gemini "Gtr Beni Gittiin Yere" as it settles down upon the

You follow Lily Kaise into the ship.
[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple
cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored
patchwork fabric, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, Emmylou the
humanoid service robot, a large green soldier felo kitten, and an old hefty
green soldier felo here.

Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Damien Alexander asks in a Tenosque accent, "Hello, Nova, ready for burnin'

Nova the little black CatBot meows at Damien.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Damien Alexander gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.
Cesar Ysidro strokes Nova the little black CatBot lovingly.
Damien Alexander tramps south.

Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Daisy May, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.

This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a

the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with

This is a slim, almost delicate-looking battlesuit, painted dark silver all
over. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the
pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of
hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A laser attachment is
mounted to the right wrist. A large plasma cannon is mounted to the left
forearm, a neutronium-laced metal tube leading to a large tank on the back of
the suit. A set of protective light armor plating covers much of the suit. A
secondary attachment with a small plasma duct, several defensive lasers, and an
EMM is mounted to the left shoulder.
It appears to be 0% damaged.

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

This is a thick heavy battlesuit, painted a mottled crimson with subdued dark
blue trim. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A bulky cockpit
encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a
framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A projectile
weapon attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A large attachment with a flare
launcher, targeting lasers, and many floodlights is mounted on the back of the
suit. A minidrone applicator is attached to the left wrist, a hose leading to a
bulky device on the back of the suit. A set of very thick armor plating covers
much of the suit.
It appears to be 1% damaged.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing

[Starship "White Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a large leather couch, a metal table, a small red insulated cooler, a
personal hoverpallet, and a small black trash can here.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast

doctors who didn't care what peole could afford, this really bothers me."
Kim Saunders nods. "And we have plenty of credits to spare to help out a bit."

You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We do and that is why I work as hard as
I do because I will give most of it for causes like this."
Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Strange, once you select the vote there should be
close option, so if it isn't, it could be broken or it's the liaison voting
getting in the way."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll be looking over the machine."

You say, "Damn, I really liked that ship."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

You kiss Lily Kaise.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fait Accompli, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I know it was cool and please keep the
name."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

You grin.
A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting.
The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to
Sol's.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

'I plan on it
You say, "I plan on it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll put a stabilizer in here."

[Starship "Fait Accompli"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a soft abstractly shaped ocean blue rug with a
design of coral and cream waves, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny
round deep purple table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern,
an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, a small
white trash bin, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Lily Kaise is lying down.
You can go south and out.

Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yay."
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for landing clearance.

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fait Accompli. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land."

[Endymion Spaceport; Landing Pad]
It is night-time here, the roughly circular landing pad lit only by several
small spotlights mounted around the edges of its rough concrete surface. With
the exception of sprawling warehouses to the east and southwest, the buildings
here are of sun-bleached adobe, with darkly tinted glass at the small square
windows. Beyond the spaceport is the desert. The night sky is filled with stars,
with a brilliant curtain of shifting lights stretching across the north.
The two-person bolt thrower "Danube", the two-person bolt thrower "Ready, Aim,
Fire", and the five-person pulsar "Fait Accompli" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and

Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Macros & Scripting
Macros are commands that let you perform complex actions instantly with a couple
of keystrokes; for instance, a command that allows you to immediately stun
another character and flee into your ship without delay. If engaging in conflict
with another player or otherwise in competition with others, you must do so on
level ground. This "level ground" is the game's built-in output and command
parsing, neither of which require significant alteration to make the game
playable, regardless of the player's individual circumstances.
Scripting is perhaps even worse, and involves complex programs that completely
automate some process in the game, usually something that generates money or
other rewards from game activities. This is, obviously, unfair to other players
that put real work into their characters.
Two things are specifically disallowed, though this is not a complete list:
1) Any alias, trigger, or script that sends input to the game (that is, enters
commands for you automatically, or shortens multi-line commands into one
command).
2) Any command bound to a single key.
In general, any client-based system that you might use to bypass the usual
typing required to accomplish something that impacts your character (such as
combat gunning, salvaging, and so on), in order to perform tasks faster or more
easily than normal human capabilities, is likely to be a violation of this
policy.
Other information:
   - We're fully aware that the capability for macros and scripts is built right
into several MOO/MUD clients. We're also aware that many players have received a
"soundpack" with a suite of macros and triggers built in. This doesn't mean that
you should be using them. Scripting is acceptable in some games, but this is not
one of them.
   - We have systems in place that automatically analyze player actions and
alert us to potential scripting, and we also have over ten years of experience
in directly observing and detecting scripters. Yes, we can tell when you're
doing it. And while you may believe you're getting away with it, we will often
bide our time and attempt to see if any other player is using the same script,
since they tend to spread. But in the end, we will catch up to you.
   - Command stacking (that is, copying and pasting in order to send multiple
commands to the game in one line of input, or all at once) and autocorrect
systems cannot be differentiated from use of a macro or alias, and will be
treated the same if they end up allowing you to perform beyond normal human
capabilities.
   - You should avoid excessive parsing of output. This includes adding
client-side "commands" to the game, applying stored output to inputted commands,
or gagging any essential information that the game provides. Classic examples
generally involve gunning and include a "retrack" command, an automatic addition
of the last tracked location to the "aim" command, and the gagging of
identifying information in tracking output.
   - Triggers which are purely for accessibility (i.e., adding sounds or colored
highlights to the game) are allowed.
   - If you act like a robot, you will be punished for scripting regardless of
the specific methodology you used. The difference between robotic behavior and
human behavior is night and day, we CAN tell when you're doing it, and we WILL
eventually level the playing field.

Subject: A Pilot's Guide to Preparation
Author: Ather Jammoa
Posted: 20:19  3 August 2316 GST
--
Greetings pilots:
This book has been updated with a few minor revisions. Most notable among them
is that there is no longer a shopping book listed in the "other books to buy"
section. This is mainly due to the fact that Elizabeth, or Berry, or whatever
her name is has either retired, or is inactive for some reason. So, her book was
erased. Emma's has also been out of circulation for quite some time. Unless one
of these books is being sold in the alliance book stores, I don't see it
anywhere.
Feel free to buy the latest copy of the book to make sure that you are well
prepared!

l asteria
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted

From the staff, submitted on Wed Aug  3 2016 UTC...
The system frequently flags you for typing some longer commands at up to 30
times average human speed. We watched it long enough to determine it wasn't
simply a false positive (meaning that it seems to happen consistently across
many combats) and then applied the penalty.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the

Pilot Kerry Rodriguez
He appears to be 31 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has
fair skin. His body is firm with muscled hips and well-muscled calves. He has
average-sized shoulders and a muscular chest. His face is average-shaped and
handsome, with an average nose and dimpled chin. His lips are soft and
occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of thin
eyebrows, his eyes are blue and almond-shaped. His short, curly hair is light
brown and neatly combed.
His right arm is bruised. 
 He is wearing a blue polo with a turned up collar, a fancy gold watch with
diamond accents, a pair of pleated black dress trousers with a silk satin stripe
down the outside seams, and a pair of thick black cotton loafer socks. He is
also wearing an indigo metachannel FTL communicator, an alliance information
assistant, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a sturdy navy blue
canvas League backpack, a black camera with a chain link strap, a deep royal
blue fleur-de-lys ring, a glowing neon blue ring, a baby blue touch einrophone
in a black leather phone holster, a gold Leo keychain, a temporary space station
reference device, an asteroid hauling supply kit, a thick synthleather bandolier
with large pockets, and a silvery band inset with a real diamond. His head,
face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, and both hands
are left uncovered.
He is carrying Kerry Rodriguez's workbench in his left hand.
Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "What would a fighter or Marauder
draw?"
Cesar Ysidro says in a Chetumal City accent, "Handful of fighters and vettes."

From the player...
On my points read out, I noticed that I have been penalised 50 points for
violating policy 7. I'd like to know where I am suspected of using scripts or
macros.

From the staff, submitted on Wed Aug  3 2016 UTC...
The system frequently flags you for typing some longer commands at up to 30
times average human speed. We watched it long enough to determine it wasn't
simply a false positive (meaning that it seems to happen consistently across
many combats) and then applied the penalty.

It is usually the "move" command entered at 1000+ WPM. Some other commands tend
to be entered in suspiciously full and perfect states, though they are less
clear-cut. Most commands that you need to use quickly already have shorter
aliases: m, sc, and so on.

Pilot Kerry Rodriguez says into the PA microphone, "Hahhaa."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

From the player...
On my points read out, I noticed that I have been penalised 50 points for
violating policy 7. I'd like to know where I am suspected of using scripts or
macros.

Message 2:
From the staff, submitted on Wed Aug  3 2016 UTC...
The system frequently flags you for typing some longer commands at up to 30
times average human speed. We watched it long enough to determine it wasn't
simply a false positive (meaning that it seems to happen consistently across
many combats) and then applied the penalty.

It is usually the "move" command entered at 1000+ WPM. Some other commands tend
to be entered in suspiciously full and perfect states, though they are less
clear-cut. Most commands that you need to use quickly already have shorter
aliases: m, sc, and so on.

Oh, ok. I think I know whats going on in regards to the move command. My
guess is I type the move command, am reminded that I need to be on autopilot,
switch to autopilot, and then when I send the move command again, the system is
flagging it as being typed really fast. If this is the case, I'm simply typing
the command, forgetting I need to be on autopilot, switching to autopilot when
reminded, and then arrowing up and pressing enter since the command is in my
command history already. However, I'll stop using the command history for that.
Thanks for letting me know.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
::T'u|Eonz^ZN?tlgS79`#$rjW~nC#X1J?4NKn>R
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's ok, at least we
can rescue those cans and have them available when there are more available to
participate in ops."
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Widowmaker.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
You hear the sound of something violently drilling into the hull.
The computer announces, "This ship has been hit by RATS starship 'RATS Reaper
Eta-0423418.'"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

[Starship "Roid Seeker"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
1=BSdY-fNY,!M9"C-Q6QV=2&oun1X~sobo`c8[Cv
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Roid Seeker.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Tau 465. Allowing
external rift insertion. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Nah, I'm good. Thanks though.
I'm going to head out there in about an hour or so."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
[Notification from Starseekers] The organization has received 2,062,838.87 EAOS

[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Perhaps a nest before we go?"
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Or, you go rather."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Lazy bums the lot of you!"

[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Normally I'd leap at the
opportunity. I am however far too distracted at the moment to be a worthy ally."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "So you'll be the Joel of the
group. Perfect."
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
purple photocopier, an insulated green cooler, a compact red refrigerator, and

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
