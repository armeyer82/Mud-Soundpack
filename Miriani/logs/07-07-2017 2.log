03:35:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An action has been approved: Add New Member: Constantine Stone (AEU)
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone has been invited to be a member of the organization.

03:35:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Welcome!"

03:35:51 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:35:59 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:35:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Welcome Constantine."

03:35:59 You say, "Oh, you have to accept."

03:36:06 Lily Kaise nods.

03:36:07 Constantine Stone asks, "How do I do that?"

03:36:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone is now a member of the organization.

03:36:35 Constantine Stone cheers.

03:36:38 Lily Kaise grins.

03:36:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire cheers.

03:36:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Welcome!"

03:37:00 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:37:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Welcome Constantine."

03:37:12 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:37:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks!"

03:37:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead! Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be annoying, but it's not!"

03:37:50 Lily Kaise says, "We haven't set up any rentals so we're a little slow on this but over the weekend, I'll work on things."

03:37:56 You grin.

03:38:01 Constantine Stone says, "Okay, cool."

03:38:07 Constantine Stone asks, "Do you need to know what I want to rent?"

03:38:28 You say, "Sure, you are more than welcome to give your suggestion."

03:38:31 You grin.

03:38:34 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm, okay."

03:38:38 Lily Kaise says, "We'll have a Combat Scout available and I need to put some upgrades on the basic asteroid hauler. We do have an escort and other ships."

03:38:46 Constantine Stone says, "I guess I haven't thought about it."

03:38:56 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yes please do."

03:38:57 Constantine Stone says, "I would like to get out to the bubble and get more exploration."

03:39:12 You grin at Constantine Stone.

03:39:16 Constantine Stone says, "And try to do GMG, but I don't know if those things are things I would rent ships for or not."

03:39:16 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok but how much exploration do you have now?"

03:39:16 You say, "That's a good thing to do."

03:39:24 Constantine Stone says, "133."

03:39:32 Constantine Stone says, "But 1800 industry."

03:39:39 Constantine Stone asks, "So I can operate a rift drive on a rental, right?"

03:39:40 You say, "Well, can't turn in anything from the Bubble yet then."

03:39:45 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

03:39:49 Lily says to you, "It's been awhile for me so did you have to get to 300 before you could turn those artifacts in?"

03:40:06 You nod to Lily Kaise. "Yes."

03:40:23 Constantine Stone says, "Oof, then I've got a lot of artifacting to do."

03:40:26 You say, "One needs 300 exploration to turn in artifacts from the Bubble."

03:40:27 Lily says to Constantine, "So going out to the bubble right now wouldn't yield much for you just yet."

03:40:31 Constantine Stone nods.

03:40:32 You nod.

03:41:09 Lily Kaise says, "One thing is one or both of us could take you to GMG but you also won't get much, just exploration and some supplies."

03:41:16 You nod.

03:41:16 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

03:41:20 You say, "But it does help."

03:41:27 Lily Kaise nods.

03:41:37 You say, "I have a ton of supplies because I went early and just collected them."

03:41:52 Lily Kaise says, "Or if one of us could take you out to 777, that would be good too so you oculd humt for artifacts there."

03:42:02 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

03:42:09 Constantine Stone says, "I thought that was for salvaging."

03:42:25 Constantine Stone asks, "So do you think that would be quicker than scrounging around Battle of Mir?"

03:42:25 You say, "There are artifacts there too."

03:42:43 Lily Kaise says, "I'm not sure where we stand with respect to Rift Inserters but I am pretty certain that the next rift accelerators will have Rift Inserters."

03:43:03 Lily Kaise says, "Yes."

03:43:09 Lily Kaise says, "And no rats."

03:43:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:43:13 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, cool."

03:43:14 You laugh.

03:43:38 Constantine Stone says, "And what about setting up stations and such."

03:43:44 Constantine Stone asks, "Is that something we do?"

03:43:45 Lily Kaise asks, "Do you have a medium transport yet?"

03:43:48 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah."

03:44:01 Lily Kaise says, "Well we can teach you and any help you can lend would be appreciated."

03:44:03 You say, "We do, and you are welcome to help with stations. Lily and I can show you what to do."

03:44:09 Constantine Stone says, "Alright cool, I would like that."

03:45:20 Lily Kaise gives a "Triple Action Faction!" key to Constantine Stone.

03:45:26 Lily Kaise says, "That's the escort."

03:45:31 Constantine Stone says, "Awesome."

03:45:42 You say, "Also, we have access to facilities. I think all of them."

03:45:44 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Nest?"

03:45:48 Lily Kaise asks, "So if you can find some to fly with, try not to crash it ok?"

03:45:51 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Sure!"

03:45:52 Lily Kaise grins.

03:45:53 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:45:54 You grin.

03:45:56 Constantine Stone says, "I'll do my best."

03:45:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:46:04 Lily Kaise says, "If you do though, I won't kill you."

03:46:10 You say, "I might though."

03:46:10 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:46:13 Lily Kaise says, "Im not like Kim."

03:46:13 You laugh.

03:46:13 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:46:15 You say, "Just kidding."

03:46:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:46:36 You say, "If she was like that, I'd have already been killed."

03:46:37 Lily Kaise says, "So."

03:46:40 Constantine Stone says, "So is this like a three-person gunship."

03:46:48 Lily Kaise says, "It is a destroyer."

03:46:54 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, that's what I meant."

03:46:56 Constantine Stone says, "Okay cool."

03:46:57 Lily Kaise nods.

03:46:59 You nod.

03:47:03 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe I'll try to do a mission or something in it later."

03:47:12 Lily Kaise says, "It's really great as a starter ship too."

03:47:19 You say, "Yep."

03:47:37 Lily Kaise says, "I would give you a key to the bolt thrower but you might not be able to launch it."

03:47:52 Lily says to Constantine, "What's your conbat?"

03:47:58 Constantine Stone says, "665."

03:48:01 You say to Constantine, "How many comat and industry do you have?"

03:48:02 Lily Kaise says, "Well then."

03:48:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:48:04 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:48:05 Constantine Stone says, "Dangerously close to a clipper."

03:48:06 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:48:08 You say, "He could launch it."

03:48:10 Lily Kaise says, "Awesome."

03:48:14 Constantine Stone says, "1800 industry."

03:48:19 You grin.

03:48:20 You say, "Nice1."

03:48:36 You say to Constantine, "Before you know it, you'll be catching up to Lily."

03:48:40 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:48:43 You laugh.

03:48:47 Lily Kaise gives a "Flash" key to Constantine Stone.

03:48:57 Constantine Stone slides a "Triple Action Faction!" key onto a keychain.

03:48:58 Constantine Stone slides a "Flash" key onto a keychain.

03:48:59 Lily Kaise says, "That's a cute little corvette."

03:49:04 You say, "It's nice."

03:49:11 Lily Kaise says, "It also has a bolt cannon."

03:49:23 You say, "If I ever get a flare. I'll take each of you up in it for a beacon drop or two."

03:49:25 Constantine Stone asks, "And those are good for disabling components?"

03:49:39 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, that's the dream. That ships sounds awesome."

03:49:42 Lily Kaise says, "Well yes you will get some from the kills yep."

03:50:05 You say, "Well, the bolt cannon can either help disable the ftl or attack the weapons."

03:50:14 Constantine Stone says, "Oh okay."

03:50:38 Lily Kaise says, "We probably will get a Clipper too."

03:51:05 You say to Lily, "Can I have my very own clipper? I've always wanted one for my veryown!"

03:51:18 Lily says to Constantine, "Do you have an asteroid hauler?"

03:51:26 Constantine Stone says, "I do."

03:51:30 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:51:45 You say to Constantine, "Just don't steal my title as asteroid king."

03:51:46 Constantine Stone says, "And it's pretty decent, though I don't have the eaos reactionless III or whatever yet."

03:51:49 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:51:55 Lily says to you, "Is it ok if we give him a key to the tug?"

03:52:02 You say, "Sure."

03:52:06 You say, "No problem."

03:52:34 Lily Kaise gives a "Chemeketa" key to Constantine Stone.

03:52:47 Constantine Stone cheers.

03:52:50 You say to Constantine, "That is the org tugboat."

03:53:04 Lily Kaise says, "Just please don't tug derelict shps out out of deep space and land them on New Earth."

03:53:05 Constantine Stone slides a "Chemeketa" key onto a keychain.

03:53:07 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:53:15 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:53:15 You say, "Yeah, no kidding."

03:53:25 Constantine Stone asks, "Is that something someone did?"

03:53:31 Lily Kaise says, "We don't need anotehr situation like they had on Chetumal."

03:53:32 You say, "It's been done before."

03:53:39 Constantine Stone asks, "What was in the ship?"

03:53:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yeh it has it was ugly."

03:53:48 You say, "Lots of bari."

03:53:52 Constantine Stone says, "Damn."

03:53:56 You say, "And chtumal got infested."

03:54:00 You say, "Chetumal."

03:54:04 You say, "I can't talk."

03:54:04 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I may have a picture somewhere."

03:54:09 You say, "I do."

03:54:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:54:12 You say, "I'll find it."

03:54:27 A leather briefcase is already open.

03:54:31 You remove a cardboard box labeled 'Books' from a leather briefcase.

03:54:37 You put a cardboard box labeled 'Books' in a leather briefcase.

03:54:40 You remove a mosaic star box from a leather briefcase.

03:54:42 You open a mosaic star box.

03:54:46 I see no "chetumal" in a mosaic star box.

03:54:52 a mosaic star box

03:54:52 This square box measures about twenty centimeters in all dimensions. It is made of silver metal covered with a mosaic depicting a large stylized white star on the top with a pale blue center and a deep midnight blue background spotted with smaller red, blue, orange, and yellow stars. The white star's tendrils stream outward in smooth arcs down the sides of the box, curving around additional smaller stars. The mosaic's tiny pieces of broken plastic and the thin lines of silver-colored cement holding them in place are covered with a thin high-gloss glaze that is smooth to the touch.
It is open.
Inside it you see a space imaging photograph of a large gas giant orbiting close to a star, a space imaging photograph of a field of twisted starship wreckage, a space imaging photograph of a star surrounded by a disc of glowing dust, a space imaging photograph of a nebula glowing with points of light, a space imaging photograph of The Flare, a photo of Shasta the sleeping big onyx soldier felo, a white lace photo album entitled "Xia He", a photo of Lily Kaise, a photo of Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec, a photo of Lily Kaise, a photo of Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Head, a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad, a space imaging photograph of a large gas giant orbiting close to a star, a blue leather photo album with a cluster of stars embossed on the front, a photo of a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "St
03:54:52 arseekers & Troubleshooters", a photo of Akemi Bando, Sassie the sleeping large fuchsia felo, and Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo, a photo of Samantha the old large violet felo, Sassie the old sleeping large fuchsia felo, Shasta the big onyx soldier felo, and a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks, a photo of Sassie the sleeping large fuchsia felo and Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo, a photo of Lily Kaise, and a photo of Evenia Callseah.

03:55:26 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, and what about plants."

03:55:32 Constantine Stone asks, "Do we have a health stock of different plants?"

03:55:36 Constantine Stone says, "Healthy."

03:55:42 You put a mosaic star box in a leather briefcase.

03:55:52 You say, "Oh, I'll have to find it, but I do have a picture somewhere."

03:57:30 You remove a mosaic star box from a leather briefcase.

03:57:32 You say, "Hang on."

03:57:46 Lily says to Constantine, "Have you looked around up here before?"

03:58:28 a space imaging photograph of a fuzzy young star orbited by rings of glowing material [inside a leather briefcase]

03:58:28 A large set of rings floats in space here, glowing material interspersed with empty space, like the grooves of a record. The empty spaces indicate where the material has accreted into young, volatile planets. In the middle of it all is the fuzzy glow of a new star, still pulling loose material into it.

03:58:43 a photo of Shasta the sleeping big onyx soldier felo [inside a mosaic star box]

03:58:43 Shasta the sleeping big onyx soldier felo
It appears to be at Starship "Intrepid"; Head.
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, spotted onyx fur, possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked white claws, visible only when not retracted. A orange, vertical nose sits below a pair of clear indigo eyes with cassiopeian pupils. It appears to be sleeping.


03:58:47 Lily Kaise says, "So yeah and our menus are a bit out of order at the moment as we have to reduce ours. It's sad because we ahd a great one but we'll deal with that."

03:58:55 a space imaging photograph of The Flare [inside a mosaic star box]

03:58:55 The glow of the stars here is dominated by the blood-red light of a red giant star. It seems distorted, with a stream of glowing stellar material pushing far out into space. This anomaly is explained by a shining point at the flare's tip: a passing dwarf star which has pulled the red giant's exterior along with it.

04:01:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok so the trustee offices are just east. At this time, I don't plan to add any truestees but it's a possibility for you, particularly if you are able to take on other responsibilities."

04:01:23 Constantine Stone nods.

04:01:26 Lily Kaise smiles at Constantine Stone.

04:01:46 Lily Kaise says, "You would be first in line though when we add more members."

04:01:50 You follow Lily Kaise north.

04:02:19 a photo of Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Head [inside a mosaic star box]

04:02:19 [Starship "Stars Wanderer"; Head]
This room is rather claustrophobic despite serving such a vital function, clearly an afterthought merely tucked away in the storage room for the sake of there being no other place to fit it. A stainless steel toilet which vents directly to space is available for use. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you cannot see anything because they are frosted for your privacy.
You see a small stainless steel toilet with Jewel the sleeping large violet glowing felo on it, a first aid kit, a glossy royal blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a fuzzy tabby print bath mat, a portable deluxe purple shower unit, and Samantha the large violet felo in the photo.
Shule Elemmire is in the photo.
You can go out.


04:02:24 a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad [inside a mosaic star box]

04:02:24 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport. A light dusting of mold spores is scattered across the landing area.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, the one-person fighter "Wraith", and a sanitation drone in the photo.
Lily Kaise and Shule Elemmire are in the photo.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.


04:02:28 Lily Kaise says, "So this office here is very useful particularly for keeping track of the life span of temporary stations."

04:02:31 You remove a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad from a mosaic star box.

04:02:35 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

04:02:43 You give a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad to Constantine Stone.

04:02:48 You say, "There."

04:02:59 Lily Kaise says, "So I did need to check something here."

04:03:05 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise.

04:03:12 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, wow."

04:03:23 You say, "Yeah, not pretty."

04:03:29 Constantine Stone gives you a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.

04:03:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:03:36 You put a photo of Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad in a mosaic star box.

04:03:41 You close a mosaic star box.

04:03:48 You open a leather briefcase for a moment.

04:04:08 Lily says to Constantine, "So look at the terminal here. Checkout the first option."

04:04:29 You nod.

04:04:56 Lily Kaise says, "The Salvage processor in 777 will go down in about 13 hours plus an hour of emergency power."

04:05:02 You nod.

04:05:10 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I see."

04:05:15 Lily Kaise says, "So at least we can sleep on it this time."

04:05:21 You grin.

04:05:25 Lily Kaise nods.

04:06:01 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, sorry."

04:06:04 Lily Kaise says, "Sometimes we have to juggle a bit to keep stations going and we don't always meet their demise with a renewed one but that's just how it is."

04:06:19 You nod.

04:06:59 Constantine Stone nods.

04:07:04 Lily Kaise says, "But we do try to keep them going with as little downtime as possible."

04:07:37 Lily Kaise says, "So feel free to come in and look over the terminal and become familiar with the stations that we contribute to."

04:07:51 Constantine Stone nods.

04:08:10 Constantine Stone asks, "So will we be replacing 777 tomorrow then?"

04:08:20 Lily Kaise says, "The ones which Starseekers put up, we generally don't need to be concerned about but we do build the Asteroid processor out in 285."

04:08:20 You nod to Constantine Stone.

04:08:37 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

04:08:44 Lily Kaise says, "Well later today actually."

04:08:50 You say, "Yeah."

04:09:02 Lily Kaise says, "I guess around 1500."

04:09:10 Constantine Stone says, "Cool, I'll try to be around at any that time so I can come with."

04:09:16 You grin.

04:09:21 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Unless I can't tell time!"

04:09:24 Constantine Stone laughs.

04:09:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:09:42 You say, "Well, I've been known not to be able to count."

04:10:27 Lily Kaise says, "Well perhaps you and shule can coordinate on that. We'll ahve to figure out schedules and things but yes, your help will be very much appreciated."

04:10:34 You grin.

04:11:19 Lily Kaise asks, "I have to see if Johann has put a salvage processor somewhere that I can access it before I sleep as I'll build it and then perhaps you guys can go deploy it later?"

04:11:31 You say, "Ok, that works."

04:11:54 Lily Kaise says, "Ok then you two coordinate as I probably won't be at work that time of day."

04:12:00 You nod.

04:12:19 Lily Kaise says, "If it is't possible and it needs to be delayed, it's ok."

04:12:23 Constantine Stone nods.

04:12:25 You nod.

04:12:39 You say, "I'll try to be around then, but I can't promise anything. It may be a bit late."

04:13:17 Lily Kaise says, "As I say, I think it'simportant to keep things going but we all have lives and things so it's not worthwhile to feel guilty if other things get in the way."

04:13:47 Lily Kaise says, "'so yeah, this is a very important office here."

04:13:50 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:13:57 Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad we have it."

04:14:21 Lily Kaise says, "So let's go see the other facilities."

04:14:25 Lily Kaise smiles.

You can go east.

04:15:18 Lily Kaise says, "Now here's the genetics lab. We don't yet have any plants but we'll be working on obtaining some which are of benefit to org ships and org member starships."

04:15:30 Constantine Stone nods.

04:15:33 You nod.

04:15:37 Lily Kaise says, "I'll hopefully get the laser plant first."

04:15:52 Constantine Stone says, "I have a storage plant on my transport."

04:15:54 Lily Kaise says, "Then we'll figure out which others."

04:16:01 Lily Kaise says, "Nice."

04:16:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:16:07 You say to Lily, "Can we get chaingun plant?"

04:16:08 Lily Kaise says, "Well I want to get that one too."

04:16:18 Lily Kaise says, "And the double hull and a good sensor plant."

04:16:30 You say to Lily, "Can we get chaingun plant?"

04:16:38 Lily Kaise says, "I don't yet know how many we can accomodate but that would be a good start."

04:16:50 Lily Kaise frowns at you.

04:16:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:16:53 You chuckle.

04:16:54 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:16:54 You laugh.

04:17:09 Constantine Stone laughs.

04:17:10 Lily says to Constantine, "Don't mind him he's a crazy dude!"

04:17:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:17:15 You laugh.

04:17:15 Constantine Stone smiles.

04:18:00 Lily Kaise says, "And no, unless a plant mutates and forms some kind of rediculous Chaingun enhancement, you won't likely find a Chaingun enhancer in our keeping."

04:18:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:18:06 You laugh.

04:18:10 You exclaim, "I'll be sad!"

04:18:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:18:19 You laugh.

04:18:27 Constantine Stone chuckles.

04:18:44 Lily Kaise says, "Now on the other hand, should we find something good for Torp launchers, that might be something."

04:18:50 You grin.

04:18:54 You say, "Yeah, that'd be cool."

04:18:57 Lily Kaise says, "Still it's not highest on my list."

04:19:00 Lily Kaise nods.

04:19:02 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:20:10 Lily Kaise says, "I have a little manual which was sent when we obtained access to this facility that I will loan you if you can't find it on the conference room table downstairs."

04:20:25 You grin.

04:20:33 Lily Kaise says, "Plants are fun to manage though."

04:20:37 You say, "They are."

04:20:39 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "One for a nest."

04:23:05 You nod.

04:23:19 Lily Kaise says, "Or a good place to put items for members only."

04:23:26 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:27:58 Lily Kaise says, "Whenever the Rentals are set up, you would go to the Ship Shop and access the rentals that way."

04:28:05 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

04:28:52 Lily Kaise says, "I'll make them reasonable initially but as we add more members, I may have to raise certain aspects such as deposits and things."

04:28:57 Constantine Stone nods.

04:29:02 You grin.

04:29:42 Lily Kaise says, "The advantage though is you can rentships at half of their requirement so I will probably put a ship with a rift drive in there and you might qualify to use it."

04:29:52 Constantine Stone says, "Sweet, that would be great."

04:30:08 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:30:21 Constantine Stone says, "That would be handy for getting out to 777 and getting my 300 exploration."

04:30:22 Constantine Stone says, "Though."

04:30:28 Lily Kaise says, "Exactly."

04:30:41 Constantine Stone says, "It would really need an autovector and that auto-artifact stopping thingie."

04:30:46 Lily Kaise nods.

04:30:49 Lily Kaise says, "It will."

04:30:49 You nod.

04:31:07 Lily Kaise says, "So will get that together this weekend."

04:31:13 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Awesome!"

04:31:14 Constantine Stone smiles.

04:31:15 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:31:18 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:31:38 Lily Kaise asks, "So let's see, any other questions or concerns or just anything?"

04:31:42 Lily Kaise grins.

04:31:56 Constantine Stone says, "Not for now, I don't think."

04:32:04 You grin.

04:32:06 You say, "Awesome."

04:32:12 Constantine Stone says, "I'm going to take a break for a bit, but I'll try to be ready to help out on the stations at 1500 or so."

04:32:33 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Thanks so much, you guys!"

04:32:42 Constantine Stone says, "I'll walk around all these ships when I wake up."

04:32:47 Constantine Stone exclaims, "And see what we've got!"

04:32:52 You say to Constantine, "No problem."

04:32:53 Lily Kaise says, "No problem. I need to go check some things and I will be going to bed in an hour or so myself. I am so delighted that you joined us Constantine."

04:32:59 Constantine Stone smiles.

04:33:04 Constantine Stone says, "Me too."

04:33:11 Lily Kaise beams at Constantine Stone.

04:33:26 [Pilot Organization Level; Corridor]

04:33:26 A long, quiet corridor leads to organization facilities.
Lily Kaise and Constantine Stone are standing here.

04:33:35 Constantine Stone waves.

04:33:38 You wave to Constantine Stone.

04:33:41 Constantine Stone walks south.

04:33:53 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:33:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Later Constantine!"

04:33:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Night org!"

04:34:00 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:34:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nite!"

04:34:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Night Constantine."

04:34:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo!"

04:34:27 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:34:33 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:34:45 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok let's go over to accord unless you had something to do while I go over there?"

04:34:55 You say, "That's fine. We can head over there."

04:34:58 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

04:35:00 You follow Lily Kaise south.

04:35:00 [Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Pilot Organization Level]

You can go north, south, west, and down.

04:35:13 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

04:35:13 You follow Lily Kaise aboard the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove".
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:35:15 You follow Lily Kaise into the ship.

04:35:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:35:17 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:35:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:35:18 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

04:35:20 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:35:21 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:35:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:35:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:35:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:35:39 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:35:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:35:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:35:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:35:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:35:46 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35:47 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:35:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:35:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:35:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:35:51 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35:52 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:35:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:35:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:35:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:35:57 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35:57 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:35:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:36:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:36:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:36:02 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:36:04 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

04:36:06 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:36:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

04:36:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:36:46 The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.

04:36:46 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 7.1 seconds.

04:36:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:36:55 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:36:59 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

04:36:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:37:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:37:11 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:37:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:37:14 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:37:14 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:37:17 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:53:32 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:53:36 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:53:37 You grin.

04:53:56 Lily Kaise says, "We're going back. I'll post a note to Ali as I know we probably both need to sleep soon."

04:54:00 You nod.

04:54:01 You say, "Ok."

04:54:03 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:54:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:54:06 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:54:11 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

04:54:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:54:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:54:38 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:54:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:54:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:54:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:54:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:54:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:54:45 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:54:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:54:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:54:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:54:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:54:50 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:54:53 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

04:54:57 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:54:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:55:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:55:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:55:16 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:55:19 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

04:55:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:55:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:55:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:55:35 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:55:37 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:55:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:59:19 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

05:00:45 Lily says to you, "Ok love, ready to go lie down?"

05:00:48 Lily Kaise smiles.

05:00:57 Lily Kaise holds your hand, taking you into her group.

12:25:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

12:25:02 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

12:26:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:26:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:26:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:26:55 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

12:26:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:26:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:26:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:26:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

12:27:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:27:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:27:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27:05 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:27:11 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

12:27:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:27:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:27:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27:16 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:27:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

12:27:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:27:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:27:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27:21 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:27:24 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Firestorm. Welcome to Accord space."

14:50:35 --

14:50:35 Hi Love, The Salvage processing station is built and ready to deploy in 'Herding Cats'. If you and Constantine depart around 1500, the station should already be utilizing its Emergency Power reserve. Therefore, if it requires an hour to travel to Artifact Alpha 777, it may expire before you arrive. Still, there won't be much downtime prior to deployment of the new station and everything will go well. Thank you for showing Constantine this process. It's great that he is interested as he will certainly be a tremendous asset and help to us especially to relieve some of the burden of deploying stations when it's difficult for one of us to accomodate the task due to our respective availability. Love you, - Lily

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

15:22:24 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

15:25:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 1,167,518.41 credits.

15:51:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I am."

15:51:41 You're already standing.

15:51:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

15:59:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:59:18 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

15:59:21 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."

15:59:23 Constantine Stone says, "I see, so like when I transfer at orion and I see the org gets a fraction of what I get."

15:59:24 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 5,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

15:59:24 [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:59:26 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

15:59:26 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,019,983.35 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

15:59:27 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

15:59:29 Constantine Stone asks, "A bunch of orgs are getting that?"

15:59:37 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

15:59:37 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

15:59:38 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

15:59:39 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

15:59:45 You nod.

15:59:47 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

16:00:12 You say, "Every org that contributed parts earns a a bit from each time someone transfers to it."

16:01:01 You say, "And wow! Nice speed going out. Means it'll probably be horrible on the way back."

16:01:07 Constantine Stone laughs.

16:01:49 Constantine Stone

16:01:49 He appears to be 22 years old. He is about six feet and one inch tall and has fair skin. His body is of average build with narrow hips and strong calves. He has broad shoulders and a wide chest. His face is long and boyish, with a straight nose and cleft chin. His lips are faintly upturned and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, his eyes are grey and narrow. His close-cropped, bristly hair is chestnut brown with slate blue streaks and mostly unkempt but standing on end down the middle in a faux hawk. He also has chestnut brown stubble. He has neatly trimmed light pink fingernails. He has a past injury on his right eyebrow.
 He is wearing a dark blue corduroy blazer, an off-white cotton dress shirt, a dark brown leather belt with a square copper buckle, a pair of casually tailored red khakis, and a pair of soft dark brown suede boots. He is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, an ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, a sturdy dark green canvas backpack, a plain flat einrophone in a dark blue reinforced plastic phone holster, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. His head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

16:02:09 You say to Constantine, "You have your spacesuit with you?"

16:02:22 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, actually no."

16:02:26 Constantine Stone says, "I didn't realize I'd need it."

16:02:39 You say, "Oh, it's a good thing to always have with you."

16:02:44 Constantine Stone says, "That is true."

16:03:10 You remove a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

16:03:17 You give a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side to Constantine Stone.

16:03:22 Constantine Stone puts on a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

16:03:24 Constantine Stone nods.

16:03:28 You say to Constantine, "You can borrow mine for this one."

16:03:30 Constantine Stone asks, "I'll need this to deploy the station?"

16:03:34 You say, "Yeah."

16:05:42 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

16:05:51 I don't understand that.

16:14:21 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

16:14:21 Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Constantine Stone is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

16:17:35 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

16:17:35 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

16:17:37 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Hello!"

16:17:37 Via general sector communication, AEU Passively Beaconed Stealth Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Welcome to Artifact Alpha 777.

17:19:15 You begin the launch sequence.

17:19:17 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

17:19:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station; Docking Bay.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go south and out.

17:19:20 A launch trajectory is located.

17:19:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:19:25 You say, "Put your spacesuit on."

17:19:29 Constantine Stone removes spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly dons them.

17:19:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:19:33 You press a button marked MODULE BAY DOOR.

17:19:33 A low vibration runs through the starship as the module bay door opens.

17:19:43 You say, "Go ahead to the module bay."

17:19:46 Constantine Stone walks south.

17:20:07 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "And when you're ready, go ahead and deploy the station."

17:20:11 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station in Artifact Beacon Alpha 777.

17:20:11 The computer announces, "League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station has come online."

17:20:27 You press a button marked MODULE BAY DOOR.

17:20:28 A low vibration runs through the starship as the module bay door closes.

17:20:57 Constantine Stone says, "Cool."

17:20:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

17:21:03 Constantine Stone asks, "What becomes of the one that's on emergency power?"

17:21:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:21:22 You say, "It'd will just fall apart and become debris."

17:22:08 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Oh yeah!"

17:22:11 Constantine Stone removes a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

17:22:15 Constantine Stone gives you a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

17:22:17 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Vortex clear."

17:22:18 You put on a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

17:22:40 The ship is already moving.

17:22:43 The ship is already moving.

17:22:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:22:45 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 776. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

17:22:45 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

17:22:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

17:22:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

17:22:55 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

17:23:02 The starship has left a unique area of space.

17:23:05 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

17:23:25 Constantine Stone says, "Wow, that ETA."

17:23:44 Constantine Stone asks, "Yeah, I was going to ask, does the order you assemble the parts in matter?"

17:23:44 You say, "Oh dear."

17:23:46 You exclaim, "Wow!"

17:23:57 You say, "Not really."

17:24:05 You say, "Just have to make sure you get all of the right parts."

17:24:24 You say, "Everything attaches to the core."

17:24:34 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

17:25:10 You say, "First, a power cable and air cable are attached from a part to the core."

17:25:28 You say, "And then the the part is combine with the core."

17:26:02 Constantine Stone asks, "Is it essential to connect air to every part?"

17:26:10 You say, "Each station has to have at minimum, a top, a core, and power. And yes."

17:26:26 You say, "Air and power have to be connected from the core to every other part."

17:26:47 Constantine Stone says, "It looks like this station was a core, the salvage processor, the fission reactor, and pickup module, and the lounge."

17:27:00 You say, "Yep."

17:27:02 Constantine Stone asks, "Which one is the top in this case?"

17:27:10 You say, "The lounge was the top."

17:27:14 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

17:27:17 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

17:27:24 Constantine Stone sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

17:27:41 Constantine Stone asks, "And where did Lily get these parts from the other orgs to assemble it?"

17:28:17 You say, "Some of the orgs just put the parts on this ship and some parts we got off of other ships."

17:28:26 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I see."

17:28:26 Constantine Stone says, "Cool."

17:28:32 You say, "Yep."

17:28:42 Constantine Stone asks, "And does it always fall to us to keep this one running, or does the responsibility rotate?"

17:28:52 You say, "This is our responsibility."

17:29:12 Constantine Stone says, "Cool."

17:29:24 Constantine Stone says, "Well hopefully someday soon I can assemble and deploy it for you guys."

17:29:27 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe not in 11 days."

17:29:28 Constantine Stone smiles.

17:29:35 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe in like 22 or 33."

17:29:36 Constantine Stone laughs.

17:29:42 You say, "The other orgs take cre of things like the accelerators, beacons, and such. We take care of asteroid processors and salvage processors in 285 and 777."

17:29:50 Constantine Stone nods.

17:30:24 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, and how do you pick where to actually deploy them, like where in space? Do you just do it right next to the existing one?"

17:30:26 You say, "Oh, it's not hard. Just a bit time consuming. Lily can show you if you ask her or I can show you too."

17:30:31 Constantine Stone says, "Cool."

17:30:48 You say, "I just put it near where the other one was. But it' doesn't matter too much."

17:30:56 Constantine Stone nods.

17:31:03 Constantine Stone says, "So right now there are two fully functional ones."

17:31:08 You say, "Exactly."

17:31:14 You say, "For less than an hour though."

17:31:18 Constantine Stone nods.

17:31:58 Constantine Stone says, "So this station has its own nuclear power plant, but I've heard of people discussing plants that use salvaged debris to power stations."

17:32:32 You say, "Yeah, but the problem with those stations is that people have to transfer debris often. If not, the station will die."

17:32:38 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I see."

17:32:51 Constantine Stone asks, "But supposing they do transfer often enough, can the station be supported indefinitely?"

17:33:10 You say, "No, I think it will last a maximum of 20 days, but don't quote me on that."

17:33:16 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

17:33:42 Constantine Stone says, "My next question was going to be if it would be worthwhile to have both a nuclear and debris plant on one station, but with a 20 day uptime, the answer must be no."

17:33:49 Constantine Stone says, "I imagine the modules are very costly."

17:34:05 You say, "Nope, and one can only have one power plant on a station at a time."

17:34:09 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

17:34:43 You say, "Unfortunately, there's no way to make these stations that we build permanent."

17:35:14 Constantine Stone nods.

Star Conquest Help: Rerolling
--
Category: Background
--

Rerolling is the process of deleting your character and creating a new one. The term derives from tabletop roleplaying games, where a character's stats had to be determined from dice rolls, and thus to "reroll" was to start over with your character. In character in Star Conquest, this process is usually called "retiring" your character.

There are many reasons that people choose to reroll. The best reason to reroll is that you feel your current character's story has been told and you'd like to try something new. If this is your reason, and your character has been well-roleplayed and your account is in good standing, please use the SUPPORT command to speak to a host about your thoughts for ending your current character and transitioning to a new one. We can help you finish your character's story and often even arrange for some of your character's progress (usually just points) to be gradually transferred to the new character. If your character has NOT usually been well-roleplayed, we are less likely to do these things. Please read Policy 14: Minievents for more information.

You should not invent your own wild retirement stories, nor have your next character or your out-of-game friends try to invent things about your old character. In the past, we've had rerolled characters supposedly die in horrible accidents, be drafted into the navy, become an advisor to the president, and somehow turn into a giant Bari, all of which were incompatible with the game's theme. If you want a story for the end of your character besides quiet retirement, you MUST speak to a host.

We have stated the best reason to reroll. There are also many poor reasons to reroll, which are unfortunately more common than good ones. Here are some that we see regularly:

* You did something silly, such as attacking an alliance-mate, and you don't care for the consequences.

* You are unhappy with your organization, but talking to people is hard and rerolling is easy.

* You are unhappy with your boyfriend/girlfriend, but breaking up is frightening and rerolling is easy.

* You did something wrong out-of-character, such as scripting combat, and got a penalty.

There are two things that every good roleplayer learns to deal with: consequences and interpersonal conflict. You cannot expect your character to be happy all of the time. Sometimes, you will do things that your character will just have to live with. Sometimes, you will have to have hard, even unpleasant conversations with other characters. These things are all part of a character's story, not a reason to end it. It's the human experience.

Remember that bad things tend to pass. In roleplaying games, memories are short. If you did something bad, you can probably be turning over a new leaf by next month. If you're in the midst of a bad breakup, you'll probably both have moved on in two weeks. Think twice before destroying a long-term character over short-term issues. It's always better to weave something new into your character's tapestry than to rip the whole thing up and start over.

Playing through a bad situation makes both you and your character stronger. Rerolling is simply a passive-aggressive easy out. We will always encourage players to stick with their characters in situations like these.

If you are committed to rerolling, there is one more important "don't": this is not the time to take parting shots at your former friends, your alliance, your organization, etc., nor is it time to suddenly launch your finest warship with guns blazing to see how much damage you can do. Doing these things with the knowledge that your character won't last the hour is out-of-character and essentially metagaming. If you are going to have it out with other characters, make it part of the ongoing story. The alternative may be satisfying for you, but it's frustrating for everyone else.

If you rerolled purely to avoid consequences or for other essentially out-of-character reasons, your character may be given a "reroll" tag on the WHO list to denote this.

The process to reroll your character is to log out of Star Conquest, log back in, and choose the "Delete Character" option. Follow the prompts, then create a new character at the main menu.

There are three reasons w
17:44:55 hy a character has been deleted:

1) You have violated policy repeatedly or proven yourself unable to play the game without being a detriment to other players or the game itself.

2) You have not played the game in over six months AND had less than 1000 aggregate points.

3) You deleted the character yourself manually, for a reason mentioned above.

With none of the above being true, your character WILL exist in some fashion.

If 1) is true, your character will not be restored under any circumstances.  Depending on the situation your account may also have been banned, in which case you will no longer be eligible to play the game.

If 2) is true, then creating a new character with your old account and opening a SUPPORT ticket in order to speak to us is the correct course of action if you wish for your character to be restored.  However, if your previous character had not left cadethood or had less than 100 points, we strongly suggested that you simply use the newer character.  You may still request a restoration, though we will explain why it is not a good idea.  If you have been actively playing the game with your new character prior to the restoration request then it will be denied.

If 3) is true, there is a 48 hour 'Deleter's Remorse' grace period where you may create a new character and open a SUPPORT ticket in order to have the deleted character restored.  Beyond this point, we will NOT restore a manually 
17:44:55 deleted character.  If you create a new character and actively play the game with the new character, the grace period is rendered void. 

Be aware that the nature of the deletion will also play a part in whether the character is restored - accidentally choosing 'Delete Character' and somehow confirming twice is one thing.  Screaming over the comm that you hate everyone and are going to go help the Outsiders exterminate humanity before deleting is another.

To play a character different to your current one, you MUST delete your current character.  Multiple accounts are against policy as stated in Policy 9, and there is no need to create a new account if a CHARACTER has been deleted.  Accounts do NOT get deleted.

Occasionally you may TEMPORARILY be unable to delete your character - this will always be for a specific reason: You are in a liaison role, you are active in the middle of an ongoing plotline, you are not in a location that makes sense for a character to 'retire' from, or you have specifically requested that we make you unable to delete your character.

What will be restored along with your character?

When a character is restored, all points they had at the point of deletion will also be restored, as will any credits they had on them at that point.

However, items are usually unrecoverable and cannot be returned to you - the character will most likely be naked and have no containers.  Any clothing, books, workbenches, etc that they had are gone.  Any robots or other items will likewise be gone, as will apartments.

Starships are not immediately purged upon their destruction or the deletion of a character but ARE removed from the game world and are placed in a temporary 'limbo'. After a grace period any starship in this location will be deleted.  If the restoration of the character occurs before the next starship recycling, there is a POSSIBILITY that any ships previously owned by that player can be restored.  If it is after the starship recycling period, the character's ships will be gone forever.

This is why an idle-purged character that was relatively new will often not be restored, as without ships or items it becomes very difficult for a 'new' character to play the game.

Category: Beginner Information

You can quit by using the @QUIT command, or by just closing your client. The effect is the same.

Alternatively, keep in mind that you can remain idle in the game for as long as you want. If you think you'll want to play again a little later, use the DOZE command to take yourself off the WHO list and remain connected.

You do not need to save before quitting. The server automatically saves all game information, including character status, at regular intervals.

You should, however, take care to quit in a private location, such as inside your ship or in an apartment. Your character will still be in the game world, asleep, and other players can still move you around while you sleep!

Also take care to land your ship and power it down before quitting. If you leave your ship in space while you sleep, it is vulnerable to theft or destruction.

Disconnected players are invulnerable to most attacks, such as unarmed combat. However, this protection does not kick in for several minutes, so disconnecting is not a viable option for avoiding attack.

18:11:25 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

18:11:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Constantine Stone is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

19:06:18 The starship is already moving.

19:06:22 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:06:22 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

19:06:22 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

19:06:25 Via general sector communication, AEU Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

19:07:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:07:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

19:07:08 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:07:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:07:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:07:11 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

19:07:17 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

19:07:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:07:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:07:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:07:21 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:07:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

19:07:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:07:25 The starship is already moving.

19:07:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:07:26 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:07:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

19:07:29 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

19:07:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:07:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:07:53 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

19:07:58 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

19:07:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:08:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:08:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:08:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:01:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

23:15:46 Hello Ather,
SEAS has established their Genetics Lab. Since newer organizations no longer receive a plant cutting with their Shell, we are seeking to buy a few unneutered cuttings.
We would appreciate it if you would provide us with a list of six or more of the most beneficial plant cuttings you would be willing to sell and their respective costs and how they would be prepared for delivery. Also what would be their respective selling price for a neutered plant?
Since we haven't submitted our first cutting yet, we're not certain how many plants we can maintain and doubt there will be many available slots at this time as we haven't a lot of command. We hope to maintain 3 or 4 though and these will primarily be utilized amongst the current three members of SEAS or for future members and aboard our organization's ships. If anyone approaches us though we would sell cuttings which are neutered but we have no plans to actively promote the sale of plants other than any unique Hybrids which we may be fortunate enough to develop.
We would appreciate the opportunity to do business with your organization.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

23:17:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello SEAS."

23:17:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

23:18:13 Lily Kaise says, "I sent that letter to Nissi as well. I'm not going to bother with Kim because she will never make a decision nor take a decent inventory of what she has."

23:19:31 You nod to Lily Kaise. "Ok. Cool."

23:20:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Of course the laser plant takes priority unless you have an issue with that? Speak up Love!"

23:20:20 Lily Kaise grins at you.

23:20:30 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Need one for a nest."

23:20:34 You grin. "Nah, I'd really like a laser plant."

23:20:41 Lily Kaise asks, "If we were only to get one slot what would you choose?"

23:20:46 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

23:20:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I would but I'm all done."

23:20:54 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "What suit you need?"

23:21:02 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Tier 2 damage."

23:21:07 You say, "Personally, I'd probably choose a grid plant, but it's the one I tend to use."

23:21:26 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I got a tier 2 Rental I could use."

23:21:30 Lily Kaise says, "Well yes but the grid plants only benefit a couple of our ships really."

23:21:30 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yup."

23:21:46 Lily Kaise says, "We have lasers on virtually everything."

23:21:55 You say, "This is true."

23:21:58 You grin.

23:22:16 Lily Kaise says, "I would say my second would be storage as in double storage."

23:22:36 Lily Kaise says, "Third I'd perhaps go for grid."

23:22:55 Lily Kaise asks, "Fourth is hull maybe?"

23:23:08 Lily Kaise says, "Fifth would be double sensors."

23:23:32 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

23:23:34 Lily Kaise says, "Sixth a torp launcher enhancement and heh if we went beyond that..."

23:23:35 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

23:23:36 You say, "I'd say double sensors before hull, but I don't even have a hull plant on any of my ships."

23:23:49 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I would likely agree."

23:24:13 Lily Kaise says, "It's nice but one can get a nanoweave which is a pretty good enhancement."

23:24:20 You say, "Yeah, exactly."

23:24:46 Lily Kaise says, "Just have to get the supplies and a league pilot willing to craft it."

23:24:52 You nod.

23:25:00 You say, "I should get a nanoweave for my pulsar."

23:25:15 Lily Kaise says, "Yep and hopefully we can eventually get them for the cruisers."

23:25:32 You say, "My cruiser already has it, but it'd be great for the org cruiser."

23:25:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."
