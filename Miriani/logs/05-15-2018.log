["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table
00:35 , and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

01:13 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:13 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a red communicator, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a masculine gold classic wedding band, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a softly padded black snuggly, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a soft white cloth diaper bag patterned with dolphins, a black stun armor storage bag, a level six archaeological dig site scanner, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.

01:13 You are carrying a small brush in your right hand.

01:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:13 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:13 You put a small brush in a black rolled toolkit.

01:13 [General Communication] Quintavious Thomas transmits, "And alex yes you got engineering this time."

01:13 [General Communication] Johanna Sanders transmits, "Do we have time for me to haul this rock, then I'm there."

01:13 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:13 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:13 [General Communication] Quintavious Thomas transmits, "Haul it."

01:13 You're already sitting down.

01:13 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:13 You're already buckled in.

01:13 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:13 The ship must be in space to do that.

01:13 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:13 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:13 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

01:13 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:13 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:13 Current coordinates: 14, 20, 6

01:13 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:13 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:13 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

01:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

01:14 #$#soundpack_pong

01:14 #$#soundpack_lag 109

01:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

01:14 You peer out and see...

01:14 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Swift Annihilation", the one-person AIE runabout "Fury", and the one-person expediter "The Blazey Speeder" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, Mell the droid, and Katie the droid here.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

02:24 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:24 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:24 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] You transmit, "Ah ok. No problem."

02:24 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:24 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:25 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:25 You have 540,060,901.20 credits.

02:25 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:25 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:25 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:25 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:25 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

14:51 [Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood king pillowtop bed)
You see nothing special.
You see a wicker dresser, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, an antique teak nightstand with a neon purple lily scented candle sitting on top of it, a mauve suede settee, a rosewood king pillowtop bed, a gorgeous small antique nightstand, an antique teak chest, a white wicker wardrobe, a pair of gray sneakers with red laces, and a pair of multi colored clogs here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (lying on a rosewood king pillowtop bed) here, sleeping.
You can go east and south.

Tapping someone with lasers, or friendly fire, is hardly going to do much damage. If someone is actually trying to blow up a ship it is pretty obvious. As Bob said, he and Ariela were joking around, and he had no intention of blowing up her ship. I would not call friendly fire pirating or anything that merits so much complaining.

I honestly think friendly fire shouldn't be directed at a smaller or non combat ship just because, and specially not when the said ship is landing from, or going to something important like a mission, or hauling/atmo. Whatever the word friendly fire might say I still think it's a not so good trick. It's up to every person how they do or what they do, but I thought I would just give my feelings on the matter. We are here to work, and do the best we can.

As I said, this is about a bigger thing than mine or anyone's personal life. This is about the so called friendly fire, not families. And I for one have it for anyone who picks on a smaller ship just because they can

Let me give you all some background.
yestereday morning, Ariela (who I am close friends with) was coming back from a mission.
I shot a pulse at her, after checking that her hull and components weren't to badly damaged. She
 returned the pulse, we landed, that was that.
It was friendly, it was a joke. there was not a question of picking on anyone.
Raj after being the skilled investigator that he is tracked it back to me who fired the first shot,
 and sent a comm whining about how I shouldn't attack ships coming back from missions. I explained
 that Ariela is a friend, it was friendly, and assumed that the conversation was over.
Apparently it wasn't, because I got another comm from him yet again today, explaining how I
 shouldn't do this and why it's wrong. I promptly explained my issue yet again, then removed the
 link.
Then, apparently having no roids to haul, praelor to shoot or literally nothing better to do with
 his life, Raj decides he needs to whine as seen here, and in so doing, can't even bother to get
 the story right.
I see no issue with this so-called friendly fire. People aren't hurt, it's kind of fun sometimes to
 try to hit ariela as she
14:52  flies by on the way to the gate, and everyone moves on with 30 seconds of
 repairs.
So rather than just complaining for the sake of complaining, is there some actual content to this
 post? What were you hoping to accomplish?

This is not about those using pulses, or your actions bob. Mine and your conversation was done with, I believe you when you said you use pulses. But my thing is for those who not use pulses, and it's about matters overall.

Okay so can you provide examples of when and where this is a problem? If it's friendly fire the
 person will be fine. If it's not, the issue you're trying to bring up is one that has been hashed
 out time and time again, that of pilots shooting each other. The only thing I see from the
 nonsensical jibberish which you're spewing on this thread is, there's a problem, it's a problem,
 we need to solve the problem. You still have yet to explain what the problem is, provide an
 example. In short, you have yet to do all the things that anyone who wishes to make a cogent
 pursuasive request for change should do.

Like, I would never open on smaller ships with something more than pulses, een if it's friendly fire. What if you screw up something in a few hits? And often people take the friendly fire excuse to take matters far, then go around and ar like, bro that was friendly fire. Yes friendly fire is fine, but not when it's just done because you can. And, as I didn't put it clearly in my last message I think, I am not talking about friendly pulsing.

So can you name a time when you, your seven wives or anyone you care about has been hit with
 friendly fire and then someone said "bro, that was friendly fire?" This is almost like me
 campaigning for saving ralph from people that throw potatos at him, because they're like bro sorry
 that was just a potato. But I've never really seen someone throw a potato at Ralph. I suppose it's
 still a worthy campaign though, what do you think? And I don't mean just little potatos, I mean
 big honking massive potatos!

Raj, if you do not cease bitching about inconsequential bullshit, I will make it my life's mission to fucking destroy you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with friendly fire. If it's not meant to seriously damage or destroy someone, it's fine. Now kindly go castrate yourself with a salt-encrusted butterknife so you can't fucking breed, asshole.

Be careful, lads. If you continue to hurl insults at him, he's going to make it his life's mission to stab you with his itty bitty little pork swart until you are dead.
PS Rajesh, you're a loser. Come to terms with it and suicide already. It would save yourself and everybody else a whole bunch of trouble.

Well, that's taking it a little far to tell someone to kill themselves already but I do agree that your whining is frankly unbecoming of a professional pilot.  If you have a problem with someone just fight back or something, other wise, get some tissues for your issues because this issue has been through the ground time and time again and it's just a part of pilot life.  A ship is a ship, just get a new one.  The more you complain the more you'll make yourself a target.

Aparently no one but you has problems with friendly fire. Or maybe one of your many wives, sisters or other family members, well, there's no big difference. If they have problems, they can go deal with them by themselves, because you are not a big help to anyone, the opposite actually, you're a pain in the ass of a lot of people. Instead of making the effort to write messages no one cares about, continue 'pulsing' your wives, as long as you can, and until someone really castrates you. And according to all these messages no one, that also includes me, would ever have some friendly fire with you. Someone should destroy or decontaminate all of your ships, put you somewhere you can't escape, ant beat/stun the crap that your brain produces out of you, so that you stop harassing and manipulating women. Next time your brain needs to shit, go to the toilet please. Thanks.

18:28 [Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Living Room] (indoors) (sitting on a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa)
You see nothing special.
You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Maggie the bot, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, and a translucent architectural design simulator here.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

Pardon me, in this case it was pulses. In any case sometimes people tap each other with long-range lasers, etc, and don't mean any harm by it. There are such things as laser reflectors if one is concerned about being hit by another ship.

Tapping someone with lasers, or friendly fire, is hardly going to do much damage. If someone is actually trying to blow up a ship it is pretty obvious. As Bob said, he and Ariela were joking around, and he had no intention of blowing up her ship. I would not call friendly fire pirating or anything that merits so much complaining.

Whether you guys thought Raj's post was worth making or not, your responses are honestly childish and unbecoming of grown-ass pilots. He didn't insult a single one of you in his posts and was making a polite request. I too feel that there's nothing wrong with friendly fire, but asking for it not to be a thing does not warrent death threats or suggestions that he should commit suicide. People actually do commit suicide because of verbal abuse such as that. Its no joke. Answer yourselves this: if any other pilot had made this post, would there have been this level of abuse flung back at them? Disagreement, yes, but actual death threats? If the answer is yes, then perhaps we all need to re-evaluate our lives and how we treat others. If the answer is no, then it means you're reacting like this just because you dislike Raj or have a personal beef with him. In that case, I'd say sort it the hell out privately and don't make it about his post on the message boards. Peace out.
