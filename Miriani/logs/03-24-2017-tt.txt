Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a

Hello Johann and Evenia,
Morning Star wants in on the Salvage Process or in 777. I do see a top from them
in LIBS transport. Ali said they would contribute the Unmanned Pickup for that
but if they are going to provide the top, it's fine either way. I'll put an
Unmanned Pickup for the ejecter on your transport as well as the Fission Breeder
Reactor.
I suggested that you all take over the Salvage Processor, Watch Tower and if
want, the Transmitter/Recharging Station and we'll do the rest. However, we
currently have 448 Command so once we reach 500, we will provide the
transmitter. The transmitter LIBS provided is still on Building Capital. Also
please feel free to take anything from Building Capital which doesn't belong to
Cats or Starseekers. so anything other than Passive Beacons, do not take the
Reactors as those are Starseekers and Kim would have a royal temper tantrum or
please don't take the Cats Core and/or Asteroid Processor Melinda would have one
of her melt downs!
here are the parts lists for the three stations and who would likely provide
them. This can certainly be changed up as needed.

Ejecter - Morning Star or Lily
Top - Morning star or Lily
Core - Nicolette
Fission Breeder Reactor - SEAS
Transmitter/Recharging Station --
Hyperwave - LIBS next one and probably SEAS thereafter
Charger - Seas next one and probably LIBS thereafter
Core LIBS or Seas or whomever wants to contribute
Large Precharged Battery - Lily or whomever wants to
Watch tower --
Long-Range Laser - SEAS
Repair - LIBS (choose one which doesn't consume a lot of power but will provide
reasonablt repairability)
Core - SEAS or LIBS or whomever wants to participate
Large Precharged Battery - Lily or LIBS or whomever wants to contribute.
I will put parts on LIBS after I mail this out. Thanks for your help and we know
it will be a wonderful day when we can add rift Inserters so that newer pilots
can enjoy 777!

Hi Love, I sent you a copy of the letter i sent to LIBS concerning stations in
777. I tried to get the big white Soldier felo and make a pet out of him but I
couldn't. When you get a chance, to give him to me, he is in Flying Cat which is
the gunship I donated to the org. Hopefully he hasn't nested but if he does,
let's hope he will create more like him. I put three soldiers, including the big
white one which I wanted, into Flying Cat. this should certainly start our white
Soldiers line. if we see anything other than white soldiers, please remove them.
If they are Soldiers but not white Soldiers, put them in Daisy May or your ship
if you don't mind. I left another white Soldier in your ship because it has a
Bari nose and I would prefer not to breed that trait into the line I'm
attempting. Love you, Lily

Hi Love, ah well! we'll see hopefully about 9 kittens in Flying Cat over the
next several hours. All three of those soldiers nested. let's hope they are all
white ones. I put three bags of chow in Kitcat so in a couple of weeks, we'll
need 3 more which means I will have go back to buying chow twice per month and
if you can help out sometimes, it would be most appreciated. Love you, Lily

Hello Kim, On behalf of SEAS, we want to express our thanks to Starseekers for
sponsoring the Rift Inserters for Artifact alpha 777. I will be maintaining the
Rift Related stations, the Transmitter and Charging station plus the beacons. So
in future, please load a couple of inserters. Just watch your Range office and a
few days before the current ones go offline, then please load them onto 'Herding
cats' which is my Constructor. I ask that you please give me a few days to put
them together as oftentimes I just have a little time to come into work,
assemble stations to be ready to deploy. Then either Shule or I will deploy them
when it's time to do so and lately it's been Shule who has performed most of our
temporary station deployments. Again, we appreciate your contribution. Although
it doesn't help those of us who have achieved our own personal best in certain
areas, it is a good thing to give back to newer pilots and to provide them with
other alternatives. Regards, - Lily Kaise

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.
