Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, an
insulated green cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, Purr the
humanoid service robot, and Shasta the big onyx soldier felo here.
You can go south and out.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Well since there are no cats
available we are going to put a processor at 134 but we have to rearrange things
a little for best effect."
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

Lily Kaise presses some buttons on the navigation board.
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for landing clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, RockIt!. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.
An obese blue soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
A big blue cyclops felo rubs up against a big blue sabre-toothed felo, and both
animals purr softly.
'Yeah, belt of Orion
You say, "Yeah, belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "RockIt!, you have clearance to launch.
Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 3123 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Eastsoutheast and Very Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
[Notification from Starseekers] The organization has received 1,447,034.58 EAOS
credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in
The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Nu 465. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Megapod raid beginning now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not bad."

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Rocky Asteroid Surface.

blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, Fabious the arachnoid security robot, and

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but

[Starship "Courageous"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened
metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow
lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate
where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent
atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One wall shows
a telltale pair of flat dents from an out-of-control forklift. A ramp leads up
to the rest of the station.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 797" and the five-person
hammerhead "Akrep" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.

they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Lbs|gM^1q~4j=kN"e%HW?|SJ!ha5wiHX_//6jB4p
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

You sit up onto a red upholstered sofa.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Widowmaker"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a high tech black star print holovid, a red upholstered sofa, and a
shiny black refrigerator with chrome accents here.

[Starship "Courageous"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "Supernova"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

Lasers are most often an AEU pilot's favorite weapon. This is mostly due to the
fact that most AEU ships get nice bonuses for our laser turrets, which makes
using them more worthwhile than using something like chainguns. In some
instances, the lasers also get a really good hull bonus which make them more
useful than heavy launchers if you have a strong enough laser upgrade. The
downside to using lasers however, is that they really drain the combat grid. So
you'll want to find a laser turret that has a good balance between damage, hull
bonus and combat energy grid. There is also a time issue, too. Some of the
heavier lasers pack a nice punch, but have a five second firing time. This could
theoretically hamper your ability to destroy ships in a timely manner. Note: the
potential damage points information in the above stats do not reflect the
additional bonus damage points available in some AEU ships.
[Notification from Starseekers] A load of salvage has been received at League
Unmanned Pickup Debris-Burning Temporary Station from the two-person medium

Currently there is only one minicannon launcher available. Minicannons are good
in that they require no ammunition, and still pack a heavy punch. However, they
are good at draining your energy grid fairly quickly, especially if you have
more than one launcher in your weapons room.

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "There's pizza in there... Help

A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

[Starship "Emerald McKay"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off. Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received. Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection."
You suddenly float up into the air as the ship's artificial gravity abruptly
switches off, and you feel your hair stand on end as the ship projects an
electromagnetic field around you. Suddenly, every seam of the ship seems to come
apart, exposing you to space. You quickly close your eyes as the vacuum pulls at
your skin and the electromagnetic field tugs you rapidly toward a starship
rescue pod.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at Providence Station; Docking Bay.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a puff-sleeved strawberry red silk blouse with a sweetheart
neckline, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX'
embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of baby blue leather clogs with
a row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her
shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and

Hello, During the first of the missions we ran this morning, one of the gunners
had the object to bypass the confirmations when guning. When it seemed that the
mission was going to be a bit much and was harder than usualy, we asked him to
put it away. He said that it had already been put away, but we didn't see any
changes and it resulted in my ship exploding. Is this to be expected? It seems a
bit much that one person was able to affect a mission so jurastically. Thanks.

Right now all I see is its standard description and the indication that I know
it's a starchart. My info says my character is 'pretty good with every style of

Subject:                 Confirmation bypass when gunning
By:                      Shule Elemmire
Location:                Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One
Originally submitted:    Mon Jul 25 05:26:34 2016 UTC

Message 1:
From the player...
Hello, During the first of the missions we ran this morning, one of the gunners
had the object to bypass the confirmations when guning. When it seemed that the
mission was going to be a bit much and was harder than usualy, we asked him to
put it away. He said that it had already been put away, but we didn't see any
changes and it resulted in my ship exploding. Is this to be expected? It seems a
bit much that one person was able to affect a mission so jurastically. Thanks.

How on earth does a lack of gunning confirmations lead to a ship exploding?

Message 3:
From the staff, submitted on Mon Jul 25 2016 UTC...
After several minutes of meditation and contemplating my life, I think I
understand what you were implying, so let me offer this as a reply instead:
The presence of a weapons bypass key has absolutely zero effect on mission
response or difficulty.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon purple
flowers, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

plant."

You say, "Or power plant."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "You look at the components and note
their power requirements and compare with the available power plants such as the
large battery or the f reactor which would be one or the other and then add up
the power requirements of the necessary components and compare with the
available power of the power plants and there you go."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I can probably buy tops and cores and
batteries now. Obviously I don't want to buy cores as those should be provided
by an organization with a Range office and I am not cash poor so if I were cash
poor, I wouldn't want to contribute batteries. However, I don't mind if I have
to pay a little more now. So if some other small org can only contribute a top
for 5 mil, I would be happy to provide the battery. I obviously can't purchase
anything which requires command points at this time since SEAS has none hehe."

that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It is always a conspiracy
against me."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Let us all conspire against the
Warburton, I hear he's a butt."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I hear that's you."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "If we're going tier 3 I got AEU
and RATS for that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Okay, how many for nests,
then?"
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Would you like to lead, Shule?
Cesar can bring AEU 3."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Still me if you can take tier
2 with all these 3s."
[Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I got tier threes."
tra tac Sure, why not?
[Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure, why not?"
[Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Actually, I don't any
more, how about that. Mutie four, rental two."

couldn't do nests for like another half an hour or so?"

[Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah, ok. Well, I'm not the
one in charge so..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah it was Ali who was
organizing this."
[Tactical Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Five people on a nest is
fine."
[Tactical Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Six is where it starts to get
silly."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I guess not a 2 and a 5 on
the same nest though."
[Tactical Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "That's a poor idea, yes."
tra tac I thought Mel said that tier 5 was still dangerous.
[Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I thought Mel said that tier
5 was still dangerous."

taking 5 was dangerous."
tra gen Yes! yes I do!
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yes! Yes I do!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's not ideal anymore
but you can get away with 5 on a nest but 4 for a pod."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Five people will make things go
a bit harder and the payout will be less, but it's still doable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Personally yes, I'd try
to stay with 4."
tra tac I thought Ali was organizing?
[Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I thought Ali was
organizing?"

though, that goes very poorly."

take 5."
[Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I dunno, I tried it
before."
[Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Organisin' a nest, that
is."
tra gen Yeah. Well, I still need to try one of those someday. Another one of the
suicidal things I should try.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah. Well, I still need to
try one of those someday. Another one of the suicidal things I should try."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Huh, apparently I'm on Earth."

number for a megapod raid."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Shule League 3, Cesar AEU 3,
Damien a Fringe 3 if possible and I'll bring a Fringe 3."

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

This is a slim but fairly tough-looking battlesuit, painted white all over,
except where the paint has worn off. It resembles some sort of large humanoid
robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs
extend into a framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A
large subsonic projector is mounted to the left shoulder. A repeating weapon
attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A microdrone applicator is attached to
the left wrist, a hose leading to a large tank on the left bicep.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
8U#s!I,m5_[xsrbKWGaS0@x;;ZRAyd}It=3T}jeK
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Comet Surface.

an old big blue sabre-toothed felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, striped blue fur,
possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked black claws
visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear indigo eyes with
horizontal pupils. A pair of vicious sabre-tooth fangs protrude from its mouth.

Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
#KrtZ~+Anu!'s,*wLM6=`t|rZaVK>&I9$'xNO0"*
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2936 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Eastsoutheast and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
[Notification from Starseekers] The organization has received 2,062,714.45 EAOS
credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in
The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Nu 465. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
An old obese blue soldier felo marches in from above.
An obese blue soldier felo rubs up against a big blue cyclops felo, and both
animals purr softly.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.
Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.
Lily Kaise places a plain white spacesuit helmet atop her head.

Star Conquest Help: Organizations
--
Category: Game Systems
--
An organization allows a group of pilots to organize in a semi-official manner.
Pilots in an organization can:
 * Share funds for the purposes of buying organization-owned starships.
 * Contribute to a group insurance fund to cover the destruction of
organization-owned starships.
 * Have their own communicator channel.
 * Cooperatively operate temporary space stations.
 * Support large starships.
TYPES OF MEMBERS
 * Founder: There is only one founder. This is the person who created the
organization. One must have 1000 aggregate points in order to found an
organization.
 * Acting Founder: If the organization's founder plans on taking a leave of
absence, they can appoint somebody to temporarily stand in as founder of the
organization. Alternately, if the founder (or current acting founder, for that
matter) is inactive for an extended period, a trustee may request the
appointment of a new acting founder. Until the acting founder steps down or the
founder unilaterally revokes their access, they will be treated as the founder
in every way, and the actual founder's vote will be similar to a trustee's.
 * Trustees: These are people with a higher level of trust, with the ability to
propose and vote on organization actions, and buy starships and station modules
on behalf of the organization.
 * Members: Regular members can contribute to the organization and use
organization-owned ships.
REQUIREMENTS
The organization, just like an individual pilot, will gradually build up
industry, combat, and other types of points as its members work. In order to buy
a ship or a station module, not only must the trustee meet its requirements, but
the organization must as well.
Members can decide which percentage of their points they are contributing, from
0% to a maximum determined by the size of the organization, most often 10-20%.
UNITY
Organizations are free to take in any member they like belonging to any
alliance. However, once more than one alliance is involved in an organization,
unity is taken into account.
Unity affects both the rate at which an organization earns points, and the total
amount of points it has. Organizations with low unity (for instance, when its
members are at war) are very ineffective.
The more alliances you bring into your organization, the more unity will affect
it. Extremely large organizations will also suffer from disorganization, which
increases unity penalties. The most effective organization will be one
consisting of a few like-minded characters who have banded together for good,
well-roleplayed reasons.
MANAGING AN ORGANIZATION
Organization rooms are present in every capital spaceport. You can manage your
organization with the MENU command, or view its information with the INFO
command.
JOINING AN ORGANIZATION
Organizations may choose to list themselves publicly and offer open recruitment.
You may go to your capital's organization room and apply to any organization
that has done this.
Organizations are also encouraged to use the in-game message board and other IC
means to recruit new members. Recruitment and other organization business should
NEVER occur outside of the game.
ACTIONS
Trustees can initiate and vote on certain actions that affect the organization
as a whole. The action will pass as soon as the "for" votes create a majority,
or fail as soon as an "against" vote makes a majority impossible.
The founder, however, can act as a dictator. Actions initiated by the founder
will be immediately approved. Additionally, the founder's vote will instantly
pass or veto a pending action.
ORGANIZATION POINTS
Organizations gain points much as pilots do. They do this when members that have
chosen to contribute points perform point-gaining activities.
To contribute points to your organization, visit your capital's organization
room and choose the Change Point Contribution Level option. Depending on the
size of your organization, you may set your contribution level to 5%, 10%, 20%,
or even up to 100%. This is the percentage of points that you will "lose" to
your organization. In other words, if your contribution level is 20% and you
gain 10 points from a load of salvage, you will keep 8 points while 2 points go
to your organization.
When an organization has 1000 industry points and 500 space combat points, it
can begin earning command points by contributing certain modules (salvage
processors, salvage op controllers, battle analysis scanners, and certain
others) to temporary space stations. Command points open up unique opportunities
for an organization to assist its alliance, generally with better station
modules.
ORGANIZATION FACILITIES
Each capital spaceport contains a pilot liaison office, and within this office
is an entire level devoted to organizations. This level has its own organization
management center as well as more specific facilities for both business and
pleasure. Organizations can choose to purchase access to these facilities.
STARSHIP SUPPORT
As you may be aware, an alliance sometimes limits the total number of starships
of certain models, particularly gunship- and cruiser-class ships. This is
because an alliance's funding is limited, and starships incur a constant cost in
energy, replacement parts, and routine maintenance performed by spaceport
technicians. Thus, for example, you may wish to buy a cruiser, but find that
your alliance is unwilling to construct and support any more.
However, this can be solved if your organization chooses to take up these costs
instead. Organizations can take over the costs of supporting starships, and
thereby, they can allow starships to be operated beyond the alliance's limit.
Every Conquest period, each starship's support cost will be deducted from the
organization's support fund. If the organization cannot cover its support costs,
flight control will deny launch clearance for the affected ships.
Note that, as of this writing, it is not of any benefit to support ships which
are produced in unlimited numbers. Also, it's important to note that this
affects only the maximum number of available starships, not the rate at which
they are constructed.
VASSALIZATION
Organizations with at least 2000 command points can become "thanes" of less
advanced organizations. "Thane" is an archaic word for one who is able to levy
resources from his or her vassals, but is otherwise not much elevated above
them. Vassalization should not be considered a punitive relationship or a
leadership hierarchy, but rather simply a way to more efficiently distribute
resources.
An organization can offer vassalization to a more advanced organization of the
same alliance, offering to pay 25%, 50%, or 75% of all station part costs in the
form of megacredits. In return, the vassal organization will be counted as a
full contributor on all stations that the thane organization is involved in.
This allows, for example, for a new or less advanced organization to pay for
half of the cost of an expensive salvage op controller module that it cannot buy
on its own, and then be counted as a full and equal contributor towards the
finished station.
In order for a vassal to pay anything, its percentage must work out to be a
whole number. For instance, 25% of a 1-megacredit station core is not a whole
number, and the vassal would not be able to pay anything.
Vassals gain by receiving credit for station activities, and thanes gain by
reducing their own, often much greater costs. This also allows for more
organizations to be involved in a single station. It will also allow
organizations of the same alliance to essentially ally with each other and work
together more closely.
Vassals must designate a certain number of megacredits to be usable by their
thane. Their thane cannot spend more than this amount. Vassals also have full
control over the relationship with the option to unilaterally withdraw
vassalization at any time.
Thanes have a togglable option to use vassal megacredits at all. If a thane
organization wishes to be the sole contributor to a station, it can toggle the
option off. While the option is on, all vassals will contribute their portion of
the station part cost. In the event that there are enough vassals contributing
enough to completely pay for the part, the thane organization will pay nothing.
If there are enough vassals to exceed the part's total cost, the highest
contributing vassals will be prioritized. Thanes can unilaterally remove vassals
at any time.
It is up to the organizations and their members to decide under which
circumstances they might offer, accept, and withdraw vassalization. Again, on
the face of it, the relationship is nothing more than a system of resource
distribution that acknowledges the thane organization's greater access to
advanced station parts and the past effort that was required to gain it.
ORGANIZATION REGULATIONS
Organizations may make whichever rules or regulations they like in regards to
who they accept as members, required contribution levels, whose starships they
will support, and so on. The game's staff will generally not help you enforce
these individual regulations; however, the organization may enforce them itself
in any manner which does not run afoul of the game's policies.
Strange, extreme, or unusual organization rules or actions may have in-character
consequences, as with anything else in the game.
ORGANIZATIONS AND ROLEPLAYING
Organizations are a good way to bring varied groups of people together and have
them engage in either conflict or friendship beyond the usual alliance lines.
Organizations should be a way to meet new people and experience the world with
friends and like-minded characters. Organization-wide endeavors make excellent
fodder for unique events organized by the game's staff.
An organization should strive to avoid becoming insular and isolated from the
rest of the game, and they should not be used as a shortcut to bring out-of-game
relationships into the roleplaying environment. An organization provides you
with another identity for your character and another way in which you can affect
the game world; it should not become a bubble which insulates you from everyone
else's roleplaying.
Additionally, a player should never be cajoled to join or abandon an
organization via out-of-game communications, nor should organization actions be
planned outside of the game. That sort of thing always does massive damage to
the game's roleplaying environment, and it will not be tolerated.
POLICY STATEMENT
Organizations make it easier to get around alliance and point requirements for
starships in a way that is difficult to enforce automatically. That much is
obvious. So in place of that, we'll explicitly state our intentions for how the
system is meant to be used. Working against these intentions in order to avoid
alliance/point requirements WILL be a violation of the Workarounds policy
(Policy 6).
 * Organizations are intended to consist of people who are friends or who at
least wish to actively cooperate. Organizations should not exist purely as
business transactions or as some sort of starship exchange. Additionally, nobody
should ever be paid to found, join, or leave an organization.
 * Members of an organization are expected to remain members on a semi-permanent
basis. Members should not be joining and leaving an organization very quickly,
and especially not joining multiple organizations within a short period of time.
 * Trustees are expected to remain trustees on a semi-permanent basis. Trustees
WILL NOT be promoted just long enough to buy a ship, and then demoted. Other
players WILL NOT be paid or otherwise cajoled to join an organization and become
a trustee just long enough to buy a new ship for it.
 * Again, organizations should never plan or recruit outside of the game. This
is covered in greater detail under Policy 9: Metagaming.

Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Who wants a salvage op?"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yes, me for defense."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Definitely. Would prefer
defense, but I'll do whatever."
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You can go north.

[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go east and south.

here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Lidia's Pride"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a gold destination finder here.
Alko Delovega and Lily Kaise are standing here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon purple
flowers, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
