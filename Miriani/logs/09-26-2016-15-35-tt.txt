Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
(60 seconds roundtime.)
Faint sounds and sensations tickle you to consciousness, as if they were coming
from very far away. A gurgle, followed by sudden dizziness.
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes, one containing Lily Kaise beating at the
hatch of the tube, a portable hot tub, an efficient round egg storage container,
a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, Lily Kaise's locker, and Shule Elemmire's locker here.
You can go north, south, and up.
You come to on the floor in a puddle of thick liquid, shivering violently, both
from cold and from the fading memory of utter terror. You struggle to rise, your
limbs shaking uncontrollably. You try to pull in breath and realize that you
cannot. Panic begins to rise.
Your throat spasms abruptly, and you spew a long stream of clear blue gel,
emptying your lungs. You cough raggedly, drawing in deep breaths, and strength
slowly begins to return to your body.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off
on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky
from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. A thick band that stretches
across all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes, one containing Lily Kaise beating at the
hatch of the tube, a portable hot tub, an efficient round egg storage container,
a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, Lily Kaise's locker, and a hairy black and red striped eight-legged
ArachnoPal named Araignée here.
You can go north, south, and up.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.

Kim Saunders
She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set
of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes
are green and wide. Her mid-back length, slightly curly hair is dark blonde and
parted on the side and smoothed back behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed
clear fingernails. She has a large black satin bow in her hair.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars
printed on the upper right arm and a pair of scuffed dark gray synthleather ship
shoes. She is also wearing a light purple cotton drawstring purse, a metallic
green touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace,
and a wrist-mounted chronometer. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and
both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar in her left
hand, and a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake in her right hand.

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold
fringe, a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft

She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set
of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes
are green and wide. Her mid-back length, slightly curly hair is dark blonde and
parted on the side and smoothed back behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed
clear fingernails. She has a large black satin bow in her hair.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars
printed on the upper right arm and a pair of scuffed dark gray synthleather ship
shoes. She is also wearing a light purple cotton drawstring purse, a metallic
green touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace,
and a wrist-mounted chronometer. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and
both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar in her left

unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light purple shipsuit with purple trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of soft light purple slippers. She is also wearing an orange

tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, and a metallic gold touch einrophone in a

The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see

life and round rocks
This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is open.
Inside it you see a white plastic undersea castle, a plastic wrecked AEU
Soothsayer, and a corpse of a large sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with
hexagonal fins.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a tiny
sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with fan-like fins, a tiny sleek speckled
amber aquatic creature with fan-like fins, a small sleek speckled amber aquatic
creature with pentagonal fins, a tiny sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with
fan-like fins, a tiny sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with fan-like fins,
a small sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with hexagonal fins, a small sleek
speckled amber aquatic creature with rounded fins, a large sleek speckled amber
aquatic creature with pentagonal fins, a small sleek speckled white aquatic
creature with frilled fins, a large sleek speckled crimson aquatic creature with
pentagonal fins, a small sleek speckled violet aquatic creature with pentagonal
fins, a small sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with hexagonal fins, and a
large sleek speckled crimson aquatic creature with pentagonal fins are living in
it.
That's fourteen creatures, and the tank could probably safely hold one more.
Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Should we keep some
people in the control room to keep an eye on the sensors for now?"

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

seamless steel keychain adorned with a tag-shaped amulet covered in tyrian
purple fabric brocaded with a floral pattern, a very delicate silver link
necklace with a sparkling silver pendant of the Clan Marzore sigil, a
Renegade-issue digital chronograph, an onyx ring, a tyrian purple flip shoes

A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes containing Rogue Romano clutching at her
throat and Klaus Stein cupping his groin protectively, his eyes wide open in
horror, a portable hot tub, an efficient round egg storage container, a crudely
hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider chow, Rogue
Romano's locker, and Klaus Stein's locker here.

but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

l lily
Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light purple shipsuit with purple trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of soft light purple slippers. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a Tardick lizard named
Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and
both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
l lizard on lily
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it
seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling
rock.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I did that to reset
the distance traveled record."
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

We heard the Coreward Reach station hypercast at us very clearly, a good sign we
haven't drifted much at all off our planned course. We haven't seen any sign of
the spaceborne lifeforms that are supposed to make their way to the station yet,
either. We're surely in the vicinity now, since we've covered another 5 LTC
since the stop for repairs.

After having gone 79LTC, Anfisa double-checked how far from Coreward Reach we
were. We were actually 78.66 LTC from it, which is both good and bad. It was
good because between that and the clear hypercasts from home it meant we were
right on course. It was bad because we were expecting to see signs of the
Aquarium's tenders, spaceborne lifeforms that gather energy and take it back to
the derelict station, before then.
We talked it over and decided to start running a search pattern. Pierre took us
up on course 212 80 for about 6 LTC, which is where we encountered Nebular
Signature 9399-9833. That nebula was not listed in Reets book "Into The Deep",
so that didn't help us find our way at all, but it remains as a landmark at
least.
We changed course again, going 212 -80, then 212 -75, and most lately 212 -65.
The slow flattening of the backtracking was Pierre's decision. The idea is we'll
travel downward a total of 12 LTC so that we'll have covered ground we have not
seen. In that way we may stumble on signs of the Aquarium's tenders.
Should that not work, we can go up and west or up and east. Our sensors are
pretty good, but these spaceborne lifeforms we're hoping to see were only
visible within about 10 LGC according to Reets book. All we need to do is see
one and start following it, and we'll likely start to see more.

After 12.38 LTC on that last course, the signal strength on the NDB locator
improved to "fairly clear." This is stronger than we want, since Reets book
mentioned the signal being "slightly weak" when they saw the spaceborne
lifeforms. It seems this signal range corresponds to between 45% and 39% signal
strength. That's a large band to cover, unfortunately, but we'll just have to do
our best.
I changed course to 122 45. We'll see how it goes.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed
on the chest and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster. Her head,
face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild
flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the
planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender
sky. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure

My dearest,
I miss you so much. I only woke up long enough to explain to you that I have had
a very busy past few days keeping me away from my piloting duties. I am hoping
that life outside of piloting clears up for me really soon, like in the next day
or so. I miss you and I keep dreaming about you. I hope you have not forgotten
me yet. I promise that I will be back very soon and resume my goal of catching
up to you. I expect my schedule to open up in another day or less. Just always
remember I love you, I will always love you, and I will always want and need
you.
Love forever,

Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.
Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed
on the chest and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster. Her head,
face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs

strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height

unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
