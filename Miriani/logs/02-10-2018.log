A starship brig allows you to easily contain dangerous enemies in order to transport them to the proper facilities. At the time of writing, the starship brig is primarily used in the capture of Praelor for return to High Guard facilities.
There are no special commands to know. Simply entering the brig with a prisoner will activate it.
