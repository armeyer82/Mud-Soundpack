The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

03:35 Katrianne Beauchene examines the starship's current course.

03:35 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:35 Katrianne Beauchene instructs the computer to begin scanning for debris.

03:35 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

03:36 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a large chunk of metallic rock onto the ground nearby.
The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a large chunk of metallic rock."

05:30 Announcement: It is with heavy hearts today that we would like to acknowledge the death of a scientific legend. The physicist Stephen Hawking has passed away today at age 76. Defying all expectations, he was one of the greatest intellectuals that tirelessly researched and discovered mysteries about the universe we live in today. We've lost an inspirational and brilliant mind. R.I.P. 1942-2018

17:16 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
