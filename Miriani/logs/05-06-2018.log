00:58 You peer northwest and see...

00:58 [Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Kitchen]
You see nothing special.
You see a seashell white teakwood counter, a crystal stand-alone sink, a seashell white teakwood cabinet, a hand-carved beech wood oval breakfast nook with a plush aqua suede high-backed bench with a sparkling crystal vase holding a dozen white lilies sitting on top of it, and a large white freezer here.
You can go southeast and west.

00:58 There doesn't seem to be anything of interest in that direction.

00:58 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

01:05 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia
01:05 mond anklet.

You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, an antique gold wedding band engraved with intertwining hearts, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, and a softly padded black snuggly.

01:08 ["Starlight Express" Deck Three; Living Quarters] (indoors)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a red kitchen sink, a tall black refrigerator, a compact black freezer, a polished red marble counter, a large mahogany dining table with an elegant red marble centerpiece and surrounded by matching chairs, a polished black marble bar with dark red velvet upholstered stools, a cozy light red suede love seat, a deep purple cooler, a beach cupboard, a tie dye kitty shaped playpen holding Shelle Sea, Amanda Torraske, Lily Torraske, a red-haired female nanny bot, and Ashley Valleris, a transparent trash can, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, and down.

01:08 Amanda Torraske starts crying loudly.
Ashley Valleris burps loudly.

01:08 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

01:53 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia

You can go south and out.

02:07 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:07 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:07 You begin the launch sequence.

02:07 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:07 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:07 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

02:07 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

02:08 #$#soundpack_pong

02:08 #$#soundpack_lag 101

02:08 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:08 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:08 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:08 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:08 The ship must be in space to do that.

02:08 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:08 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:08 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

02:08 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:08 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:08 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

02:08 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:08 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

02:08 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:08 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

02:08 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

02:08 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:08 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:08 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:08 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:08 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:09 #$#soundpack_pong

02:09 #$#soundpack_lag 101

02:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:09 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:09 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

11:44 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: I suggest exploring that a bit. You will find stores with useful equipment, including communicators that aren't receiver only.

11:45 #$#soundpack_pong

11:45 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: I also strongly suggest reading the policies to avoid getting in trouble with said communicator, type policy to start reading those.

11:52 #$#soundpack_pong

11:52 #$#soundpack_lag 117

11:52 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: You need to throw away the receiver only one and buy a normal one and wear it. From there, read help communicators.

11:52 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: Trash that in a trash can if you can find one, and buy a regular communicator from the menu. You will need to turn the chatter channel on when you get it. Let me caution you now though, don't talk about typing commands on the chatter channel. Once you buy that new communicator, you must be in character. That means you're a space pilot flying a starship with technology, not somebody typing on a computer. Yes, please read help communicators and ask if you have questions.

12:01 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: I recommend having them all.

12:02 #$#soundpack_pong

12:02 #$#soundpack_lag 113

12:02 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: The regular comm lets you talk on the normal channels like chatter, general, and your alliance channels. Think of the metef as like a radio. You can tune it to frequencies and chat with groups of friends, or on the unofficial out of character chat at 500.0. The flight scanner is like a radio for flight control towers at the planets and stuff. The alliance information computer shows what territory your alliance controls as well as the status of any alliance wars.

12:03 #$#soundpack_lag 121

12:04 [Newbie] James Johnson: Oh no in character oops.sorry.

12:04 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: Just remember that you're a spaceman flying your ship around space. So instead of saying, what command do I type to do this? You might say, what button do I push on my message board reader to make it work.

12:05 #$#soundpack_pong

12:05 #$#soundpack_lag 119

12:05 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: You can say you just graduated from the piloting academy, or that you just got your license, something like that to explain your back story. There isn't really a lot of story, just as long as you're playing the part of a pilot.

12:06 #$#soundpack_pong

12:06 #$#soundpack_lag 117

12:06 [Newbie] James Johnson: I've not enough credit's for a flight controll scanner unfortunately. I wish I'd not over done my buying of items.

12:06 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: You can get a loan from the ATM on the landing pad, or you can read help activities and start earning money.

12:06 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: You might find an ATM on the landing pad which will let you take out a lone. Just save 1.5 million for a cargo hauler ship.

12:38 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:38 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:38 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

12:38 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:38 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:39 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:39 The ship is already moving.

12:39 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:39 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:39 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:39 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:39 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:39 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:39 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 9, 9, 9."

12:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:39 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

12:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

12:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:39 You peer out and see...

12:39 [Summit; Public Docking Bay]
This spotless docking bay is large and features a sophisticated retractable roof. The walls are comprised of solid glass and give a dazzling view of the sector beyond. The roof is designed to retract into the walls and supporting brackets when a ship is coming in to dock, and will expand and seal itself in a matter of seconds. Illumination is provided by carefully placed lights along the outer-most portion of the ceiling and floor. One unique feature of the lighting system is the lights dimming as a starship is coming in to dock and when the ceiling retracts into the walls. Several cleaning drones whiz about, tidying things up as they move.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the nine-person ameliorator "Glitz Pit" and the six-person dart "Harvest Moon" landed here.
You see a fish-shaped mailbox, a green plastic dumpster, a rich brown mahogany bench set back from the landing pad, a metallic pole-mounted commercial flashing billboard, and a little white rabbit here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

12:42 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia
12:42 mond anklet.

She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia

12:48 There are no ships here.

12:48 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:48 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:48 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:48 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:48 Ashley Valleris suddenly says, "Babababa!"

12:48 You peer out and see...

12:48 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the one-person fighter "Quack Attack" powered down here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the ten-person battlecruiser "Sic Semper Tyrannis", and the six-person destroyer "Canavara" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, and south.

13:20 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.

14:09 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.
You can go south and out.

19:19 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.
You can go south and out.

19:19 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia

20:03 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.
You can go south and out.

The reinforced steel of this massive landing site gleams in the multitude of lights glittering from the massive spaceport tower to the north. The curved structure spears up towards the sky, its exterior marked and colored with a vast array of murals and messages. Its many windows glow with blazing light, and enormous colored spotlights cast their beams down from the very top of the tower. A sculpted granite archway leads into the spaceport, and above it is a gold embossed plaque with engraved letters which read, Miriani Spirit tower. A lighted sign directing pilots to the spaceport garage is visible off to the left above a set of gleaming metal stairs which lead downward. In the far distance, at the gated edge of the landing site, there appears to be a small brick structure with several people gathered around it.
You see the one-person bulk conveyor "Miriani Interplanetary Delivery 721" and the one-person expediter "Saving Myself" landed here.

22:22 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.

22:23 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miriani; Landing Area.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, and a pair of gray sneakers with red laces here.
You can go south and out.

22:23 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:23 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:23 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:23 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:23 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:23 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:23 The ten-person battlecruiser "Storm of Torment" has undocked from Empanda Station.

22:23 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:23 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:23 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

22:23 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:23 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:24 You count 18 items in a red archaeological artifact storage container.

[Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the eight-person gunship "Kingdom Harts" and the three-person heliogaster "Trinity of Oblivion" landed here.

It has a gold stun armor top, a gold stun armor bottom, a gold stun armor helmet, a pair of gold stun armor boots, and a pair of gold stun armor gloves connected to it.

22:56 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

22:56 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:56 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

22:56 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:56 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:57 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:57 You stand up.

22:57 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:57 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:57 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:57 You must stand up first.

22:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:57 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

23:27 You peer northwest and see...

23:27 ["Al Nar" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.

23:28 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Hi"

23:28 Renee Chance's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "hey"

23:28 You sit down on an overstuffed gold gunner's chair.

23:28 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:28 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:28 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:28 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:29 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:29 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

23:29 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:29 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:29 [Private | Cria Blur] You transmit, "Katrianne wants the bids by mail."

23:29 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
