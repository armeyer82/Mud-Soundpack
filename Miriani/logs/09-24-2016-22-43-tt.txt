Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
dusky pink rattan cabinet, and a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it here.

[Starship "Unicorn"; Control Room]
This control room would look less out of place as an old atmospheric fighter
cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able
to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The
nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that
one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the
pilot's controls. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Space Market.

The sensors tell you that this area of space is remarkably full of dust and

reminded more than one spacer of a giant clam with a pearl. It is clear that
most spacers have never seen a clam.
A small space station is here, an aged hunk of metal in space, with bright
lights mounted to show that it's still operational. A basic friend-or-foe ident
signal is all that advertises it to be Chet's Grill and Space Sports Bar.
Occasionally, the station expels a jet of particles as the kitchen empties its
fryers of grease.

[Space Station "Tandem"; Docking Bay Alpha]
Though its dark metal bulkheads are stained from years of use and patched in
places from various mishaps, this large rectangular docking bay is nonetheless
in good working order. Heavy blast doors on the west end of the bay open and
close to admit small starships or to allow them to depart, the station's
precious air supply caught and recycled in a system of automated starship-sized
airlocks, while larger ships must dock at rings set into the north and south
sides of the bay. Among a number of signs mounted to the walls, one sign located
beside the wide hatch leading east toward the center of the station warns pilots
to garage their ships whenever possible, though several are usually parked here
in the bay, the light from rows of glowing tiles in the deck and ceiling
glimmering off their metal hulls. Beside the east hatch is the entrance to a
long ramp leading down to the garage below.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Klaus?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ah well guess it's not causing him a
heart attack."
Lily Kaise laughs.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor

[Starship "Zro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Subject: Aquarium Journey: Rules and things
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
Posted: 00:42 25 September 2316 GST
--
Welcome to aquarium visit! Here are some things to keep in mind so everything
goes super well :
-There is no maned felo on ship, but some might have a bad temper if you bother
them. We are not turning back if you get arm mauled from your squeezing of
random felos. Valuable lesson here about touching unknown things.
-Clothes are optional, especially in cryo-pods. A spacesuit is suggested when
leaving the ship.
-You can go where you want on ship, but do be quiet if there is something
important happening at control room. Like dodging patrol of hostile aliens or
some such other unlikely things.
-Life support is a bit overloaded, do your part by calmly sleeping in cryo-pods,
should there be one available. I think there are four. As aside, do not
photograph, bother and especially do not eject people out of the pods.
Punishment for doing so is occupying nice cryo-pod for rest of journey.
-No idea who wants eggs and shells. But they are all to be dropped in one single
container of eggs of The People. Distribution will be done at the end according
to the needs of The People. How one would gauge need of having alien fishes is
delicate art.
-There are things to drink at nice side table of forward observation.
-We are not exactly sure of where we are going and drift can be very bad
sometimes. If in storm that is going sideway, raise the rear mizzen. Any
situation where drift would be significant, really.
-Going slow is boring, if flow going near our face, deploy the forward jib.
Might need to adjust heading for a bit to reach that maximum boost of speed.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of skinny white low rise jeans, and a pair of sparkly white
leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria',
and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.

l asteria on lily
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it
seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average,
naturally shaped breasts with prominent lightly tinted nipples. Her abdomen is
firm and punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has bushy dark blonde
pubic hair and a firm butt. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an
average nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and
occasionally part to reveal a set of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of
lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are green and wide. Her mid-back length,
slightly curly hair is dark blonde and parted on the side and smoothed back
behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails. She has a large black
satin bow in her hair. She has a tiny birthmark on her neck.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing a delicate ring of silver wire and
small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace, and a

This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is average in size and covered in short, spotted black fur,
possessing a long, bushy tail that slowly flicks back and forth. A tall, spiked
ridge of black fur runs along its head and spine like a sort of mohawk. The
felo's long, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, straight white
claws visible. A violet, diamond nose sits below a pair of bright red eyes with
heart-shaped pupils. It is wearing a sparkling diamond collar. It also has a
small pair of light violet butterfly wings and a dark pink satin tail ribbon
tied in a bow.

This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world
below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you
can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that
checker the world below. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at
a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Subject: More About Galleonic Sails
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
Posted: 04:29 25 September 2316 GST
--
I talked a bit about the extra sails on masts of galleon in previous postings,
but maybe some more details would be useful, just in case.
Mainsail: Is the one in the middle, all you can do with it is change trim to
change speed of vessel. Very standard. Will stay at 100% trim most of time
unless trying to sneak away from Outsider patrol or someone is having very hard
time approaching an oort cloud.
Jib: Is the sail on forward mast, perhaps the most complex one. Here are jib
tips depending on various rift conditions.
-Very favorable flow, speed of galleon is over ninety percent of flow itself: Is
suggested to set trim at 100% and match heading of the ship (Usually 36 2 in
this case). This will not increase or decrease speed, but will reduce drift very
slightly.
-Sideway flow, speed of galleon around half of flow: Jib can do nothing here,
set trim to 0%, else ship will slow down for no benefit.
-Flow in the face, speed of galleon around a third of flow: This is exciting
moment for jib, set it at 100% and set an heading on it that is somewhat
diagonal to flow, kind of a tacking heading. Don't forget elevation and don't
hesitate to experiment with the heading a bit to get best speeds. Related to
that, flow will always be turning around slowly, so come back to jib often
during slow speeds for slight adjustments that will provide slightly more speed.
Mizzen: That is sail at rear of vessel, mostly used to reduce drift at cost of
some speed. Note that heading of it must always match the one of ship for it to
have best effect. It is best used if flow is sideway or ship is in a storm,
those conditions are the most drifty and can push ship around a lot. This is bad
for aquarium, so the significant speed lose in storm might well be worth it.
Otherwise, mizzen can also be used to make approaching a location easier,
especially if in a storm. Have someone back there to keep heading match.

[Starship "Zro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, a small seashell pink
trash can, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

The curtains close, to no applause.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like
thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Belatedly Morris, just tell the bot to

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor

replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Yes."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "One through nine is the same."

Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Yo yo yo, is 24."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "'O', that is."
Soraya Rhyz asks in a Luna accent, "240 LTC?"
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "I thought the 0 takes up one of the 25
digits, leaving no space for O."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Why am I doing math? Ick."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "So 24 25s."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "O0."
Keegan Wantz exclaims in an Asuncionite accent, "Converting light-years to base
25 is somewhat silly, though!"
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "My brain already hurts. It's defective."
Soraya Rhyz snuggles up to Keegan Wantz's shoulder.
Luja Garland snickers.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "But if I don't convert, all I can tell
from "distance traveled: 26 LTC" is that we've traveled pretty far."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Well. You can just be like me and figure
we'll get there when we get there."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Much less mathy."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "The 26.63 is in base ten."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Time's mostly base 25."

Keegan Wantz switches on a personal filing computer.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Each LTC is 7.74 light-years or
so."

light-years."
Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.
Luja Garland exclaims in a Filipino accent, "Aha!"
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "So we're about a third of the way to
the aquarium now?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Roughly."
Kim Saunders nods. "Looks like that indeed."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "I suddenly miss the cryotube."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's between 68 to 73 LTC I think."
Luja says to Soraya, "You miss the cryotube?"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Because math."
Keegan Wantz leans on Soraya Rhyz.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Exactly."
Luja Garland snickers at Soraya Rhyz.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "The cryotube is very quiet."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "And thus my brain is very quiet and
relaxed."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "It's really only unpleasant at the beginning
and the end there."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That is true."
Kim Saunders glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "I've tried the cryotubes. Feels like I
get frozen -which is really cold- then suddenly unfrozen. I didn't even remember
any of my dreams in there."
Hymn the big blue felo suddenly jumps onto a long table dressed with a fancy
white cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Oooooort."

today."
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the

Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Oort."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Overload of oorts."
Lily Kaise glances down at her neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer
momentarily.
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "Are these aready known to be found?"
A space imaging photograph projector displays a slowly rotating projection of a
swollen dying red star.
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "Err, already?"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Doubt anyone's charted those."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "But we're not likely to find
anything new."
Rogue Romano nods.
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "Not on way at least yeah?"
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Hmm?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, Akemi told me that we are
expected to go straight for the aquarium and not stop for anything. But once we
have been there and set up the station, I think we wil explore some."
Keegan Wantz nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I am pretty certain that is what
Pierre would prefer unless it's planets."
Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "When do we expect to arrive to this
aquaria?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "According to Akemi, planets are
included in stopping for nothing."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "A day and a half or so?"
Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Oh okay."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ah ok."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Because, her words not mine, it is
believed that this route has been traveled before and we won't find anything
new."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "It's been travelled a lot."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well that is what we thought and we
found three."
Keegan Wantz exclaims in an Asuncionite accent, "You were going the wrong way,
though!"
Keegan Wantz winks at Lily Kaise.
Kim says to Lily, "I think we were very much off track."
Kim says to Lily, "What was your heading again?"
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in
from the south.
Hymn the big blue felo gazes at Samantha the old large violet felo for a moment,
then asks, "Mrrp?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We were about 3 or so Eastish."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We went essentially the same direction
but from the out of comms cluster."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, over a distance of 600
lightyears, a slight change makes a huge difference."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Well, if you think about it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And we must have drifted badly for
some reason."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It can of course."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "600 light-years straight north is
just that."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Throw it off by even one degree and
that becomes..."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We did not go straight north."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Our heading was 31 4."
Keegan pulls out a notebook, and a small reference book.
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "He did not say we
did, he is trying to explain how slight differences in heading make a huge
difference in where you end up."
eta
I don't understand that.
Lily says to Kim, "That is clear enough."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Tenish light-years east and 590ish
light-years north."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "That's a lot of light years."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Closer to 599."
Lily says to Keegan, "Are you referring to your trip?"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "But that one degree brings you off
course by 10 light-years over a 600 light-year distance."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, ".. I'm refering to in general."
Samantha the old large violet felo rubs up against an emerald green armchair
with a hand-made purple and sapphire star quilt on it, purring softly.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, add the unpredictable factor
called drift, plus where we started out from also was a bit different, and you
miss the aquarium, either by a hair or by a lot. Which was unfortunate."
Kim Saunders takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Keegan Wantz nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway it's not worth arguing over. We
actually encountered some of the same points wpresent in the book."
A space imaging photograph projector displays a slowly rotating projection of a
swollen dying red star.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "They also took a wild and crazy
'let's go in some random direction' sort of heading."

fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Nohr the obese black horned felo wanders out.
A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes containing Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys
clawing at the tube's hatch, his face frozen in a rictus of terror, Aisling
cupping her groin protectively, her eyes wide open in horror, and Rogue Romano
beating at the hatch of the tube, a portable hot tub, an efficient round egg
storage container, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black
plastic tray of spider chow, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys's locker, Manx the
little calico CatBot, and Aisling's locker here.
You can go north, south, and up.
Kim Saunders strolls in from the south.
"Does the mizzen still need to stay up?" Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her
face as she ponders.

Subject: More About Galleonic Sails
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
Posted: 04:29 25 September 2316 GST
--
I talked a bit about the extra sails on masts of galleon in previous postings,
but maybe some more details would be useful, just in case.
Mainsail: Is the one in the middle, all you can do with it is change trim to
change speed of vessel. Very standard. Will stay at 100% trim most of time
unless trying to sneak away from Outsider patrol or someone is having very hard
time approaching an oort cloud.
Jib: Is the sail on forward mast, perhaps the most complex one. Here are jib
tips depending on various rift conditions.
-Very favorable flow, speed of galleon is over ninety percent of flow itself: Is
suggested to set trim at 100% and match heading of the ship (Usually 36 2 in
this case). This will not increase or decrease speed, but will reduce drift very
slightly.
-Sideway flow, speed of galleon around half of flow: Jib can do nothing here,
set trim to 0%, else ship will slow down for no benefit.
-Flow in the face, speed of galleon around a third of flow: This is exciting
moment for jib, set it at 100% and set an heading on it that is somewhat
diagonal to flow, kind of a tacking heading. Don't forget elevation and don't
hesitate to experiment with the heading a bit to get best speeds. Related to
that, flow will always be turning around slowly, so come back to jib often
during slow speeds for slight adjustments that will provide slightly more speed.
Mizzen: That is sail at rear of vessel, mostly used to reduce drift at cost of
some speed. Note that heading of it must always match the one of ship for it to
have best effect. It is best used if flow is sideway or ship is in a storm,
those conditions are the most drifty and can push ship around a lot. This is bad
for aquarium, so the significant speed lose in storm might well be worth it.
Otherwise, mizzen can also be used to make approaching a location easier,
especially if in a storm. Have someone back there to keep heading match.

Star Conquest Help: Children Of The Sun
--
The species currently known as the Children of the Sun were encountered after
the subjugation of humanity by the Outsiders, and the subsequent rebellion of
the alliances.
They are eight to ten feet tall therapodians with varying dark shades of scaled
skin. They also possess a series of thick translucent crystalline plating on
their torso, arms and thighs that is usually a brighter colour.
They appear similar to bipedal dinosaurs such as tyrannosaurids or
dromaeosauridae, but with significant differences. They possess three clawed
toes and an elongated and serrated dew claw on each foot, with two fingers and
an opposable thumb on each forelimb, again clawed. Their eyes are capable of
independent movement and possess W-shaped pupils.
The location and size of their space is unknown, but humanity has learned that
their homeworld is called 'Place of Rest', and they have constructed a battle
station named 'Tooth and Claw' somewhere close to human space.
TIMELINE
During the early days of the post-subjugation rebellion, humanity seemed to have
caught the Outsiders off-guard. They eventually responded however, with both
Outsider forces and warships from an unknown species that quickly became known
only as Outsider Battle Thralls.
After the assault and capture of the Outsider Mothership 'Zmnyi Myaz', several
pilots began to attempt to communicate with these Battle Thralls, hoping to
cease the conflict with what they supposed was another subjugated species.
With several false starts, not helped by human computer systems being unable to
interpret even the most basic transmission from this new species, a Children of
the Sun ship expelled two identical devices before retreating, and this was
taken to the Accord and the Pact to attempt to reverse engineer it and decipher
its purpose.  
This technology remained a mystery until the rescue of the famous scientist
Peter Fienstein, who was able to grasp the technology behind the device,
revealing it to be a form of Outsider translation unit, capable of learning. He
quickly began work on developing a method to interpret Thrall transmissions
based on information within the devices, with the intent of eventually creating
a fully fledged human-thrall translator.
Eventually a basic conversation was held via ship-to-ship transmissions between
human pilots and a Children of the Sun vessel, and after several such
'meetings', the Child of the Sun pilot was willing to land and meet the humans
in person.
Diplomatic efforts are currently on hold as factions within the Children of the
Sun have begun a civil war due to interaction with humanity.
FACTS
The chitinous crystalline plating that covers a Child of the Sun's body appears
to have grown as some form of natural armor, as opposed to merely being worn.
They can produce a range of tones from below human capability to far beyond our
capacity to hear, but cannot vocalise in a manner to form sounds that could
allow them to speak Esperanto or another human language.
The Children of the Sun are split into several castes: Tongue, Eye, Fang, Scale,
Claw, Tail.  While they are not perfect matches, the castes can be considered
thusly:
TONGUE: Leadership caste, the diplomats, politicians and rulers. They have
apparently been exterminated by the Outsiders, with the sole exception being
Flight Over Hill.
EYE: Dreamer caste, this caste is apparently akin to both artists and
scientists.
FANG: Provider caste, this caste has something to do with food, but the Children
of the Sun seem reluctant to discuss anything that involves eating with us.
SCALE: Healer caste, this caste contains the doctors and hatchery nurses.
CLAW: Worker caste, this caste seems to contain builders, engineers, craftsmen.
TAIL: Warrior caste, these appear to be the soldiers, pilots and scouts.
Their language and culture is heavily image-based, making translation difficult
due to the minor but important distinctions they appear to have for various
forms of imagery. True understanding of the various meanings for 'image' is
still some time away, but it is clear that they consider the caste marking on
their chest plating more than simply a drawing, and that to have no image is
very, very bad.
They are currently at Stage Two Subjugation, where the species has significant
autonomy as long as any Outsider edict is immediately followed, and significant
portions of their production capacity is used to fuel Outsider needs.
They have recently begun a civil war, dividing the species between those who
feel that humanity's influence is positive and those who feel that humanity's
influence is negative.  More detailed information is lacking, including the
scale of the conflict.
RUMOURS
Children of the Sun appear to attach some cultural significance to eating, and
refuse to do so or allow it in their presence. They also wear a thin mesh-like
mask over their snouts to hide their mouths, for reasons unknown.
While all Children of the Sun that have been spoken to have considered
themselves 'Good Battle Thralls', many do not seem to enjoy the Outsiders being
their de facto 'Tongues'.

Star Conquest Help: Outsiders
--
Category: Background
--
Useful information regarding the Outsiders is difficult to come across.  This
help file will be split into three sections:  a Timeline of events, Facts and
Rumours.
TIMELINE
In late May of 2297, the League, AEU and Fringe pilot leagues, with the
assistance of the EAOS, manage to locate and destroy the main fleet of the
unregistered pilots calling themselves Renegades.  After this, the survivors of
the Renegades surrender, only for a massive unknown starship to emerge,
revealing itself to be the source of the Renegade's superior technology.
This ship was the alliances' first sighting of an Outsider vessel.
It declared human independence over - from that moment on, humanity had been
subjugated by the Outsiders, and a portion of all production from both the
humans and Jinu is sent to Outsider space in unmanned transport starships.  For
the most part, the touch of the Outsiders on humanity during this period was
relatively light.  Non-pilots know very little of the situation, and even the
pilots themselves see little in the way of evidence of subjugation.  Over time,
however, humanity's rebellious streak seems to give the Outsiders pause, and
restriction after restriction are put in place.
In 2304, however, the Outsiders announced that the Terms of Occupation had been
violated, and began their campaign of devastation.  Once the beacons allowing
humanity and the Jinu to locate one another were destroyed, all space stations,
spaceports and centres of technology in human space were destroyed.  Humanity
was sent to the brink of civilisation collapse, and the Outsiders tightened
their grip on the human race even further.
FACTS
Only one Outsider has ever been seen, and even then only by the respective
leaders of the alliances and a handful of pilots.  This was Zmnyaz, who appears
to be the creature in control of the Zmnyi Myaz, what humanity has termed the
Outsider Mothership.
The Outsiders are tall, seven-feet tall creatures.  They possess cylindrical
bodies supported by three long, thick legs spread out equally around its base. 
Three-quarters up the body are three tentacled limbs, and near the tip is a blue
band that extends completely around the cylinder.  Zmnyaz at least does not
appear to wear coverings, but it did possess a device that translated its own
method of communicating (some form of low rumbling) into human words.
Travel to or within Outsider-controlled space is banned, any alliance ship
entering space not holding an active human beacon but claimed by the Outsiders
is likely to be destroyed.
RUMOURS
The blue band at the tip of the Outsider's body is assumed to be its eye,
meaning that they have full 360 degree vision.
Considering the actions of Zmnyaz the (very) few times it has met with alliance
leaders and pilots directly, along with the extreme distaste the Outsiders seem
to have for actually interacting with humanity, it is believed that the species
is highly xenophobic.
The exact extent of Outsider space is unknown, but it is clear that it is vast
even compared to the once combined Human-Jinu Known Space.
The Outsiders refer to humanity as Species #187, though whether this is merely a
catalogue number of all species encountered or some other reference is unknown. 
Even this by itself, however, implies that the Outsiders know of, if they do not
actively control or subjugate, many other alien species.
It is also implied that, due to how humanity and the Jinu first encountered what
we know as the IFS, along with the unknown Battle Thralls that currently assault
human space, that the Outsiders prefer to use vassal races to control others,
rather than interacting directly themselves if they can avoid it.

Yeah, it says she was the one who set off the beacon to lure the outsiders to
the hidden portion of humans, and they turned into an ambush, but what happened
to Kendra Janus , I mean it ended the war, sort of anyway, but she was trying to
kill everybody lol.

The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

Just for the sake and comfort of my own sanity, the  mobiles we have while being
extremely primitive and bulky in the SC universe. did in fact exist  during as
well as before and after the occupation, correct?  and just not often seen
around but mostly used by the citizens? 
by that i mean Doctors, Lawyers, people like those who could easily afford what
would be likely costly.
Do I have that correct?

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.
The following is a listing of current and former (player character) pilots
holding ace or veteran status.

[Starship "Zro Des Cartes"; Forward Observation]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold
fringe, a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy
poster of Nouveau Quebec Premier Maxime Roberge giving two thumbs up, a small
cinnamon brown trash bin, a large bubbling royal blue-lit aquarium containing
white round rocks, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a
side table dressed with a fancy white cloth decorated with gold fleur-de-lis, a
black plastic tray of spider chow, a glossy dark violet ceramic felo chow bowl,
a soft square brown floor cushion, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, and a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe here.

The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A

suppose."

person to go on those, as it just splits up the points. The SVP space missions,
unless something's changed, won't let you do them if there's another person in

You peer south...
[Starship "Zro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world
below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you
can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that
checker the world below. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at
a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes containing Rogue Romano beating at the hatch
of the tube and Kim Saunders cupping her groin protectively, her eyes wide open
in horror, a portable hot tub, an efficient round egg storage container, a
crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
You can go north, south, and up.
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle
around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

You recline back in the tank. A moment later, with a hollow gurgle, you feel
viscous, ice cold liquid beginning to lap at your feet.
The liquid envelopes your feet, and they feel freezing cold for a painful moment
before going completely numb. The liquid, thick and black like crude oil, rises
slowly, turning your legs numb.

The cryo-gel rises to your abdomen and then to your chest, numbing your entire
torso. You are no longer aware of your breathing or your heartbeat. Inexorably,

pushing your nose and mouth into the small remaining pocket of air. Your neck
turns numb, and then the back of your head.
The liquid covers your ears and then, without any fanfare, it envelopes your
face. All you can see is blackness, and your entire body is numb. You
instinctively hold your breath.
