Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, Ciera the humanoid service robot, a black upholstered sofa, a very
large and extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin,
Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, Kiwi the little calico
CatBot, Mischief the large black felo kitten, and a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.
Lily Kaise and Johann Rowan are sitting on a black upholstered sofa.
