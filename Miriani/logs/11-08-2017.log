00:43 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

01:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

01:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

11:06 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

11:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

11:06 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

11:06 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

11:06 You deftly draw a stun turret from a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

11:06 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

11:06 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

11:06 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

11:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

11:06 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

11:49 ["Samma" Weapons Room 3] (indoors) (buckled into a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a small white marble side table with elegant gold leafing twining up the legs, a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact turquoise cooler, and a silver trash bin here.
You can go northeast.

12:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

12:24 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:24 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
The ship is already in space.

12:24 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

12:24 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:24 The ship is already moving.

12:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:24 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:24 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:24 The computer announces, "Three planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

12:24 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:24 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 15, 1, 10."

12:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Saturn.

12:24 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:24 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

12:24 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

12:24 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:24 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

12:24 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:24 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:25 You can't power down the starship in space.

12:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:25 You must stand up first.

12:25 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

12:25 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Uranus; Landing Block.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

To create a sculpture:

1. Buy clay
2. WORK clay
3. MOLD clay

You will need to choose the atributes of your sculpture while in the molding process. If you don't like the way your sculpture came out, just SQUISH it and start over!

If you're satisfied with your sculpture and wish to make it permanent:

1. Ensure that the kiln is HEATed. The door will need to be closed, and no clay present within the chamber.
2. Once the kiln finishes heating, open the door and place your sculpture in it.
3. Close the door and FIRE the kiln.

Once the kiln finishes firing your sculpture, it will become a masterpiece that can no longer be reworked. If you like your artwork, you can take it next door and SUBMIT it for sale to the public. Just remember, if you wish to do this, you need to SIGN your sculpture prior to firing or the store won't accept it.

This warehouse-like shop is rather large. Stacks of crates line the floor, each containing a different type of tool or material with which to sculpt. A few pieces of furniture are displayed, each with a droid demonstrating how to use them. A blackened kiln takes up the majority of the shop's center, and next to it is a sign with instructions for the novice artist.

12:53 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Uranus; Landing Block.

Easter eggs are fun and exciting for the whole family!

To get started, you will need two things: An egg to paint and canisters of paint. Once you obtain them, decorate them with the following commands:

PAINT EGG WITH <canister>

You will be prompted with two (as of writing) options: Mix and paint. If you choose the option to paint, it will put a small layer of that paint on the egg. If you want the intensity of the color to be stronger, paint it again. After you paint your egg with several colors, you can begin mixing them into different patterns. When you choose the mix option, it will ask you for a style and then ask you to select available colors for mixing. After you've chosen your colors, hit 0 to indicate that you're done. That's it!

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Uranus; Landing Block.
You see a black leather recliner, an internal stun turret, and a large pottery wheel here.

You can go south and out.

13:28 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:28 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

13:28 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Three planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

13:28 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

13:28 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:28 Enter a destination:

13:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:28 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:28 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 7, 3."

13:28 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:28 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:28 The starship is already moving.

13:28 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:28 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:28 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:28 You can't power down the starship in space.

13:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

13:28 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:28 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

13:28 You must stand up first.

13:28 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

You can go south and out.

13:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

13:36 You begin the launch sequence.

13:36 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

13:36 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:36 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

13:36 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:36 The ship is already moving.

13:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:36 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:36 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:36 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:36 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:36 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:36 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

13:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:36 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

13:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

13:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:37 You must stand up first.

13:37 You don't see that here.

13:37 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:37 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise.

Pockmarked and filled with reddish dust, a crater surrounds the domed landing pad. Beyond it, a cold wind swirls the dust into random patterns, removing any trace of landing mark or footprint. A rocky landscape fades into the dim horizon, largely empty save the treacherous dust, and the scouring wind. The only indication of habitation is the dome, the force-field that keeps in the atmosphere, and a scarred platform where only a few ships may be recharged at a time. Near it, a small rundown structure appears to have been built, its red-brown stone nearly camouflaged by its surroundings.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at 51 Pegasi b; Balloonzia Circle Landing Pad.

14:03 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:04 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:04 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:04 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:04 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:04 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:04 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:04 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

14:04 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:04 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:04 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:04 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:04 There are no ships here.

14:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:04 You press a button to scan for recent wormhole activity.

14:04 No recent wormhole activity detected.

14:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:04 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:04 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

15:45 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miriani Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

15:45 You peer out and see...

15:45 [Miriani Garage]
This magnificent multi-level garage echoes with the sound of voices mingled with the electronic whirring of the hundreds of robotic arms transporting starships to and from the landing pad above. The curved walls of the structure have built in metal recharging platforms large enough to fit several starships at a time. Bright white lights affixed to the steel beams crossing the ceiling cast an unrelieved illumination over the hundreds of service drones darting between the powered down ships. At the far southern end of the garage is a lighted stairway which leads down.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go down and out.

15:57 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:57 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:57 The ship is already moving.

15:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:57 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:57 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:58 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:58 You are carrying an application for the ten-person battlecruiser in your right hand.

15:58 You don't see that here.

15:59 Please be aware of the following basic guidelines for battlecruiser ownership:

* You must demonstrate the maturity to handle the ownership of such an advanced piece of technology. Monitors listen to the communicators and if you say that you are in league with the Praelor, are a child of a Praelor, have given birth to a Praelor, or otherwise have allegiances that conflict with those of the High Guard or your alliance, you will have your battlecruiser license revoked. Please note that this includes "renouncing" your alliance or the High Guard.

* You must use your battlecruiser in the defense of human space against targets the High Guard has deemed threatening, such as Praelor or rogue human pilots.

* Your battlecruiser rights will be revoked should you attack sectors 24 (High Guard Command) or 12 (Bellerophon), in any way, shape, or form. While the space station and Rolukssica base are equipped with defenses to deal with proximity weapons, blockades, and known enemy vessels, it is NOT there to clean up after irresponsible pilots. If you are found attempting to circumvent ANY defenses in High Guard space, your battlecruiser license will be revoked and may not be restored.

* Any action contrary to the goals of the High Guard, such as preventing combat missions, blockading the space station, blockading the mission jump gate, or otherwise interfering with High Guard operations is justification for the removal of these rights.

These are extremely basic guidelines. We will not attempt to spell out every specific situation, as it's your responsibility to make good decisions and judgement calls. By sending this application in, you are agreeing that your right to the battlecruiser class starship is at the sole discression of the joint committee for the regulation of advanced human war technoligies and may be revoked at any time for violating the above guidelines or in any situation the committee deems worthy of removal of these rights.

For more information on the battlecruiser testing process, please refer to message board post 13665.
You see some questions on an application for the ten-person battlecruiser...

1.) What is your name?

2.) How would you rate your combat abilities? Poor, average, excellent?

3.) Do you regularly participate in High Guard missions to protect known space?

4.) What would the primary purpose of a battlecruiser be in your fleet?

5.) What do you intend to name your battlecruiser?

6.) Imagine this hypothetical situation and describe how you would handle it. You're flying through uncharted space in your battlecruiser and you happen upon a lone Praelor starship. What do you do?

7.) Consider this situation: Praelor are invading known space and you find yourself on a planet with only two others. Your only option is to launch into a sector filled with Praelor who are probably swarming around the planet just waiting for you to launch. What do you do?

8.) Your friend has been 
15:59 kidnapped during an invasion and is currently being held prisoner on someone else's ship. You have a full crew together, and you could easily retrieve your friend. Do you stay and fight the Praelor, or do you rescue your friend?

9.) You're being continually harassed over the communicator by someone. They aren't causing you any physical harm, just insulting you. One day, you're in your battlecruiser and you see him salvaging. Do you attack him?

10.) Have you ever operated a starship or any other vehicle under the influence of a drug such as alcohol?

11.) Have you ever committed an act of random violence against an innocent creature, such as a proboscis monkey?

12.) Are you willing to have your battlecruiser destroyed in the defense of humanity?

13.) And finally, you are free to make any additional comments here.

16:19 You peer out and see...

16:19 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see Aaliyah Morales here.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

16:19 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the seven-person expeditioner "Cheese To The Stars", the five-person transverser "Iridescence", the three-person freighter "Pineapple Express", and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 9948" landed here.

16:34 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:34 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:34 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:34 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

16:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:35 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:35 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:35 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:35 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:35 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:35 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:35 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:35 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:35 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:35 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:35 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

16:36 ["Fatal Destiny" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:06 You peer northwest and see...

17:06 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact light blue cooler on wheels, a laughing robotic teapot, a yellow lab, and a plump golden retriever puppy here.
You see Dora West (sitting on a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

17:06 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to green.

17:06 You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

17:20 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact light blue cooler on wheels, a laughing robotic teapot, a yellow lab, and a plump golden retriever puppy here.
You see Dora West and Alex Mercer here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

17:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

17:21 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

17:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

17:21 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

17:21 You earn a 872,772.22 credit starship destruction bounty.
You earn 5,000,000.00 credits for the successful completion of a combat mission.
You successfully hit enemy starships 43 times during your last combat mission, destroying 1 of them.
You contribute 1,000,000.00 credits to the owner of the ship.

17:21 You peer northwest and see...

17:21 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact light blue cooler on wheels, and a laughing robotic teapot here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

17:21 You hear several loud thuds as cargo is transferred from the ship.

17:22 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

17:22 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

17:22 A haunting screech drifts in from the storage room as something heavy is dragged across the floor.

17:22 [Newbie] Alex Mercer: Does it have anything else in it?

17:22 The noises coming from the storage room gradually cease until they can be heard no more.

17:22 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

17:22 [Newbie] Allen Robinson: No.

17:22 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

17:22 ["Samma" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a small white marble side table with twisting iron flower vines encircling the tabletop, a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a turquoise plastic cooler on wheels, and a silver trash bin here.
You can go northwest.

17:22 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

17:22 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:22 [Newbie] Alex Mercer: In that case, not sure, perhaps you can buy a big enough ackage and dump the contents in to the package?

17:22 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:22 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:22 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:22 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

17:22 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:22 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:22 [Newbie] Allen Robinson: That might work. Thanks.

17:23 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

17:23 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:23 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:23 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

17:23 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:23 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

17:23 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:23 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:23 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:23 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:23 You have 955,192,531.33 credits.

17:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:23 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

19:21 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

19:21 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

19:21 Amore Carver (C) (Female) is asleep!

19:22 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

19:22 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "amore" reports current location pinpointed at Apartment 316308.

19:22 You can't launch from here.

19:22 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:22 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

19:22 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

19:22 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:22 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

19:22 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

19:22 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

19:22 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:22 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:22 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:22 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:22 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

19:22 The ship must be in space to do that.

19:22 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

19:22 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:22 Those coordinates are currently occupied.

19:22 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

19:22 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Planets: (4, 4, 7)

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (8, 16, 1)

19:23 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

19:23 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:23 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:23 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

19:23 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

19:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

19:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:23 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

19:23 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

19:31 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

19:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:31 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

19:31 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:31 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

19:31 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

19:31 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:31 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:32 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:32 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

19:32 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:32 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

19:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:32 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers.

19:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:32 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

19:32 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:32 I don't understand that.

19:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

19:35 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

The large slab of metal which serves as this planet's landing pad has been set in the middle of a tiled plaza. Surrounding the busy landing area, the garishly colored tiles sparkle with an unnatural brightness. High railings and a steep set of stairs lead down from the metal platform, the sides of which have been buried in bobbing balloons in every color imaginable.

20:00 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

22:04 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

22:12 A scientist says, "I'd be glad to give you one, but I need a few items, first. Many of the components to make the receivers work must come from alien species."
[1] Oh, never mind then.
[2] What items do you need?
[3] I have your items.
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:13 You say, "What items do you need?"

22:13 A scientist says, "I need the following items to complete the receiver. A small box with holes in it and a single knob on the side, a small monopole magnet, a thin triangular piece of metal, a misshapen mass of metal, a flexible piece of wire, a flat heavy object with a series of buttons and knobs on it, a tiny metal chip, a device flashing numerous alien symbols, a glowing metallic object with two terminals on top, and a small piece of plastic with a series of bumps etched on it. If you can put all of these in a container I will give you and return here, and if you have at least 6500 license points, simply ask me again if you can have a receiver. I'll sell you one in exchange for the items and fifty million credits."
[1] No, never mind. Maybe later.
[2] Ok, I'll do it. May I have the container?
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:13 You say, "Ok, I'll do it. May I have the container?"

22:13 A scientist says, "Ok, here you go. Be sure to use this container to put the items in before bringing them to me."
A scientist gives a protective component container to you.

It is addressed to nobody and was sent by nobody.

my dearest Love,
First, I'm quite surprised that you were upset with my being in your ship. Since i am the one who left, I find it perplexing that you took offense. i honestly thought that you would be pleased to find that i had returned. I thought you would be happy to see me and that we could at least discuss things. I also felt that it was the time the other night when I left that i felt that I was so ready to consumate my love with you. I had been thinking often lately of how i wanted to make love with you and how I'd just so much wish that we had the opportunity to just hangout for a couple of days and cuddle and make awesome love. I know that for me, i've always wanted that to be a special time, a special moment in our lives when I could express how I truly feel about you. I didn't want it to be just a casual experience as for me love-making isn't merely a physical act. For me, making love is the deepest possible emotional experience one can ever have. I expressed how heart-broken I was and I meant it because here I was finally ready. Then you turned your back on me.
I know Love it's not been an easy time for you to wait for me to be ready to be more physical. It's just that I wanted to be certain that you truly felt the same way and that when we did take that special journey into the depths of our love, that it would be the beginning of something which was everlasting.
I am so sorry for making the statements I did. I deeply am but don't you understand that what you did was deliberately hurtful? What had I done which was so wrong for you to seem as though you went out on a cheap and hurtful act to be cruel to me. How would you have felt if after hearing you express how hurt you were and sad, and then you discovered I was in a house which belongs to nobody which has a name that sounds like some sort of a house of ill repute or a place where pilots go to exploit sex? Yes, I looked up the property and it is to be auctioned. Obviously, whomever you are having your sexual escapades with doesn't have the decency to take you to her own place but must poach in a property which isn't hers. She was obviously added to the garage and Biometric lock so how sneaky. how can you trus that sort of judgement over mine? Oh too, how in two days can you say that you love someone else? Again, I don't feel remorseful for calling this person cheap and one I would not readily consider to have true feelings. There are women pilots around and yes I can name several, who will talk the talk and make you feel all warm and loved when they're just as much into the experience as you are for it's physical value. Love does not evolve overnight and you should know this. All I can ask of you my Darling is that you would please stop to consider that your actions were themselves hurtful. you didn't even seem to want to 
22:25 talk with me but gave me the cold shoulder for a wrong which I did not commit. I was so looking forward to being with you then and yes, as i said, I truly thought that you would see it that I wanted to show you forgiveness when you found me there. I had also placed a special bed in your ship for us. So no Love, it wasn't intended at all to be spiteful. I am shocked! because I also thought perhaps what you did was a sort of acting out. That you felt rejected by me perhaps and that by my returning to you and being available for you would show you how much I truly cared.
Please Honey, I truly believe that we should try to work out our issues. I thought that I meant enough to you that should we have differences, that you wouldn't just do something mean and hurtful like this as a form of 'getting even?' I truly don't understand as I had no idea that you were angry with me over anything? I'm not a mind reader Sweetheart. I am merely a human being who needs to be treated with reason. What you have done is not reasonable because you never even provided me with a means of defense. Still, the only thing which seems to be quite obvious is that you wanted sex? Well you were certainly about to have what i hoped would be a good time with me <smiles!>.
I know my Love, that i haven't been at work as much for the past couple of months as well. But you know if it had of been you, I would wait until the end of time for you. I would travel to the end of this Universe and beyond for you because I love you more than any man in the Universe. It would be worth the wait to me. It truly would be because I love you so much and you are worth it. Not because you are the handsomest man in the Universe as that's just a wonderful fringe benefit. If you weren't so handsome, I would still love everything about you. We have had interruptions in the time that when I have been here. When you decided to leave and then return, this took a lot of our timewhich we could have enjoyed together. I'm not blaming you for this, just merely pointing out that there have been circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I have been here, you've frequently been involved in space combat and I will admit that I have felt a bit ignored as you had many hours to work yet it seemed that work was more important so you show up around the time when I'm generally going to sleep. How is that enough time to begin our love-making journey?
There is an exception to my love for you and that is I don't love it how you flaunted your actions with someone else to hurt me. Yes I may forgive you for this in time though as I know that men are more physical and often do act out which seems to be what you have done especially if they don't think they are being satisfied. I am so deeply sorry Babe that you went to such lengths and when we are together again and I believe we will be, that you have my assurance that you can always express your concerns to me. You are free to tell me everything you want and you should never hold back. I might not always be comfortable with what you say but we should always have open communications. Honesty is paramount in every relationship which works.
This is no way to call what we have over Love. Relationships are work but I am willing to listen to you and to do whatever it takes to please you. I so want this to work for us. I know that whomever you are with, that your rushing into things is most definitely not going to be good for you. How do you know that she hasn't drawn you in for other selfish reasons? I know that some women who are associated with pirates and other dishonest types will prey upon others who have assets and use sociopathic behavior to take advantage of someone like you. You are a very nice guy and easy-going and you are definitely a target. I love you honestly and sincerely and not for anything other than for you. Yourself had nothing when you met me and although what you have achieved is incredible, it's still a vulnerable spot for you as someone could take advantage of you very easily.
I will leave the garage access open to to you here at Empanda and i am enclosing a couple of starship keys. I just ask you never to bring anyone into my ships without my consent or unless they are mutual friends of ours.
I love you Tibo.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

22:26 
Congratulations on the purchase of your brand new Lore computer from LoreTech Industries.

The new line of Lore computers features several new advanced editing features over the pre-existing filing computers.

1) When editing files, you will be given the option to append your new data, rather than always overwriting.
2) You can export files from one location, and re-import them into new folders.

Note that any incoming files resulting from the use of TransLink hardware will also end up in the export memory, and must be imported into the folder of your choice. The export memory will hold files indefinitely, but they will not be accessible for viewing or editing.

Remember to check back with LoreTech Industries often for new hardware and applications.

Best Regards,
LoreTech Industries

It is addressed to nobody and was sent by nobody.

my dearest Love,
First, I'm quite surprised that you were upset with my being in your ship. Since i am the one who left, I find it perplexing that you took offense. i honestly thought that you would be pleased to find that i had returned. I thought you would be happy to see me and that we could at least discuss things. I also felt that it was the time the other night when I left that i felt that I was so ready to consumate my love with you. I had been thinking often lately of how i wanted to make love with you and how I'd just so much wish that we had the opportunity to just hangout for a couple of days and cuddle and make awesome love. I know that for me, i've always wanted that to be a special time, a special moment in our lives when I could express how I truly feel about you. I didn't want it to be just a casual experience as for me love-making isn't merely a physical act. For me, making love is the deepest possible emotional experience one can ever have. I expressed how heart-broken I was and I meant it because here I was finally ready. Then you turned your back on me.
I know Love it's not been an easy time for you to wait for me to be ready to be more physical. It's just that I wanted to be certain that you truly felt the same way and that when we did take that special journey into the depths of our love, that it would be the beginning of something which was everlasting.
I am so sorry for making the statements I did. I deeply am but don't you understand that what you did was deliberately hurtful? What had I done which was so wrong for you to seem as though you went out on a cheap and hurtful act to be cruel to me. How would you have felt if after hearing you express how hurt you were and sad, and then you discovered I was in a house which belongs to nobody which has a name that sounds like some sort of a house of ill repute or a place where pilots go to exploit sex? Yes, I looked up the property and it is to be auctioned. Obviously, whomever you are having your sexual escapades with doesn't have the decency to take you to her own place but must poach in a property which isn't hers. She was obviously added to the garage and Biometric lock so how sneaky. how can you trus that sort of judgement over mine? Oh too, how in two days can you say that you love someone else? Again, I don't feel remorseful for calling this person cheap and one I would not readily consider to have true feelings. There are women pilots around and yes I can name several, who will talk the talk and make you feel all warm and loved when they're just as much into the experience as you are for it's physical value. Love does not evolve overnight and you should know this. All I can ask of you my Darling is that you would please stop to consider that your actions were themselves hurtful. you didn't even seem to want to talk with me but gave me the cold shoulder for a wrong which I did not commit. I was so looking forward to being with you then and yes, as i said, I truly thought that you would see it that I wanted to show you forgiveness when you found me there. I had also placed a special bed in your ship for us. So no Love, it wasn't intended at all to be spiteful. I am shocked! because I also thought perhaps what you did was a sort of acting out. That you felt rejected by me perhaps and that by my returning to you and being available for you would show you how much I truly cared.
Please Honey, I truly believe that we should try to work out our issues. I thought that I meant enough to you that should we have differences, that you wouldn't just do something mean and hurtful like this as a form of 'getting even?' I truly don't understand as I had no idea that you were angry with me over anything? I'm not a mind reader Sweetheart. I am merely a human being who needs to be treated with reason. What you have done is not reasonable because you never even provided me with a means of defense. Still, the only thing which seems to be quite obvious is that you wanted sex? Well you were certainly about to have what i hoped would be a good time with me <smiles!>.
I know my Love, that i haven't been at work as much for the past couple of months as well. But you know if it had of been you, I would wait until the end of time for you. I would travel to the end of this Universe and beyond for you because I love you more than any man in the Universe. It would be worth the wait to me. It truly would be because I love you so much and you are worth it. Not because you are the handsomest man in the Universe as that's just a wonderful fringe benefit. If you weren't so handsome, I would still love everything about you. We have had interruptions in the time that when I have been here. When you decided to leave and then return, this took a lot of our timewhich we could have enjoyed together. I'm not blaming you for this, just merely pointing out that there have been circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I have been here, you've frequently been involved in space combat and I will admit that I have felt a bit ignored as you had many hours to work yet it seemed that work was more important so you show up around the time when I'm generally going to sleep. How is that enough time to begin our love-making journey?
There is an exception to my love for you and that is I don't love it how you flaunted your actions with someone else to hurt me. Yes I may forgive you for this in time though as I know that men are more physical and often do act out which seems to be what you have done especially if they don't think they are being satisfied. I am so deeply sorry Babe that you went to such lengths and when we are together again and I believe we will be, that you have my assurance that you can always express your concerns to me. You are free to tell me everything you want and you should never hold back. I might not always be comfortable with what you say but we should always have open communications. Honesty is paramount in every relationship which works.
This is no way to call what we have over Love. Relationships are work but I am willing to listen to you and to do whatever it takes to please you. I so want this to work for us. I know that whomever you are with, that your rushing into things is most definitely not going to be good for you. How do you know that she hasn't drawn you in for other selfish reasons? I know that some women who are associated with pirates and other dishonest types will prey upon others who have assets and use sociopathic behavior to take advantage of someone like you. You are a very nice guy and easy-going and you are definitely a target. I love you honestly and sincerely and not for anything other than for you. Yourself had nothing when you met me and although what you have achieved is incredible, it's still a vulnerable spot for you as someone could take advantage of you very easily.
I will leave the garage access open to to you here at Empanda and i am enclosing a couple of starship keys. I just ask you never to bring anyone into my ships without my consent or unless they are mutual friends of ours.
I love you Tibo.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

My dearest Love,
Honestly Tibo, I would like to give you more credit for having
some sense of better judgement. But based upon the circumstances
involving you and this woman, you sure are naive enough to think
that this selfish woman who moved in on a relationship and
interfered and whose only purpose is to satisfy her own whims and
to gain at your expense. Reliable sources have already informed me
that she sleeps around with anyone she can. I know you won't
believe me but so just ask your friends ... that is if you have any
left. Her offer to repay you was merely to connive you moreso into
thinking she is innocent when I feel certain she was or is working
with Fawkes and Cria and company. If Fawkes can manage to claim
and sell your Transverser, then there's something in it for her at
your expense. If she were being honest and forthright, She should
have offered to repay you for the entire loss and nothing less. If
he claims your Transverser, you won't be able to obtain another
unless you disown it and the AIE considers allowing our Specialty
ships to be claimed by other Alliance pilots as a very serious
offense. You will have to wait for a time before you can obtain
another one. If you think you can catch it, heh good luck! It is
the fastest starship amongst pilots and so you will have to likely
interdict it or get ahead of it and trap it in a mine field which
of course will defeat the purpose of reclaiming it other than if
you can manage to rescue it in time before it is destroyed. Fawkes
is pretty fast and it will take a lot to beat him. I doubt that I
could and i've been around pilots similar to him. One guy was very
similar in his tactics but it took a lot of us to gang-up and beat
him into submission until he gave-in and quit piloting.
Hopefully if you had any droids aboard, you have their remotes as
you should never leave droids just sitting around in starships
carrying their remotes unless they are followinng you or you are
out of comms. It's obvious that if your ship is stolen, then if
your droids are aboard, then to the victor goes even more reward
unless they decide to boot them and it's not likely Fawkes will do
this.
You should have thought better of any suggestion to move your
Transverser from Acrylon or a safe sector at all and especially in
a slow Gunship. You could have independently flown it to wherever
you wanted and outrun Fawkes. I've been chased before by Battle
Cruisers in my Transverser and what was in it for me was a lot of
laughs. just think about it. Oh Tibo Darling let's just load your
trannie into your gunship and take it to my house. Of course had
you managed to reach the destination, you could still retrieve it
if she didn't manage to let someone else in first to steal it.
I find this so insulting that you should run to such a low life.
Had you found a better woman than me, the heart-break wouldn't be
any different but I could at least acknowledge and eventually
accept it that you found someone who would be decent and honorable
and true and who isn't self-serving only towards her own benefit.
Yes, I was wrong for not being persistent to remain in your ship
and hold onto you. i just thought if it meant something to you
that you would come for me and apologize for your behavior towards
me but i just wanted to go off and cry. I would have been willing
to talk things over with you but I was so baffled as what did I do
to ever deserve this? Absolutely nothing except that I wasn't
ready for being totally intimate. Wow that is such a selfish
excuse don't you think? You had every opportunity to discuss it
with me and to ask me rather than to be spiteful and punative
towards me. I did nothing wrong yet you behave as though I did.
In all of this, I am so sorry for you and for your losses. However,
i am not sorry that you got your ass kicked bigtime. you deserved
it and I wish I would have grabbed you and stunned and stranded you
over your abject and utter stupidity and horrible disgrace of
judgement. This is something I sensed could happened especially
when you foolishly lost your gunship to Cria. Still, I also
thought you learned a dear lesson concerning not to give blanket
trust to someone you really don't know. It's clear that 24 by 7 sex
rules you and sex is more important to you though which is why I
said I'd have more respect for you if you would think with your
head rather than your penis as your penis is certainly where your
judgement is at this time. I trusted you with my own ships as I
didn't think you would behave so wrecklessly with any of my ships
and thankfully so.
This doesn't mean that i don't love you as I will admit it that i
will never stop loving you even though it's foolish. I love your
affections but once hurt by someone I loved deeply, I wanted to be
certain that he wouldn't betray me and treat me as you have. So
yes I so want you back but it will take a long time for me to feel
that I can really trust you and that you will be faithful. When I
love someone I love with everything and I am forever loyal. I
don't place conditions on how much sex I'll have or how much the
other person is worth. i just love the whole person and knowing
that we are imperfect human beings in an even less perfect
Universe, we must accept that at times one may have to give more
than the other at times. I am willing to give more to forgive you
although I won't forget it. You are a very wonderful person and I
guess I would like to think that you are prone to not thinking very
logically at times. Here someone who works with others as an envoy
to exploit vulnerabilities in guys and women too. When Fawkes does
sell the ship if he can, She gets a cut of the profit. I can see
by her track record that she is no prize to the Commonwealth in
terms of productivity towards the defense of humanity or other
aspects.
Tibo, if sex 24 by 7 is your priority then why did you become a
pilot in the first place?
Last, I would like to go out of the area for awhile in a week or
two. Since you have a huge financial loss to deal with, it isn't
going to be easy for you to recoup those losses with Fawkes et al
hunting you. You are welcome to join me but she is not. You will
not even be able to disclose the date, time nor point where we are
leaving from to her as well as she will only inform Fawkes and
company to chase us. Sorry if this angers you but blindly going
along with the demands of your sexual partner are cause enough for
me to have to say these things. Otherwise, yes, I would assume as
I used to, that you would keep any of my plans confidential even if
you are involved.
I have no plans to stun or strand you either. I'm just relating my
utter frustration with the fact that something has obviously not
provided a sufficient enough of a wake-up call that you need to be
more guarded of your assets with someone you don't know as well as
me. You can trust me though because I don't need anything of yours
nor anyone else's. She on the other hand is too lazy to work hard
for what she wants and relies on more shady methods and for this,
she will always have just enough to get by.
I love you,
Kitty

Kitty, 
It's amazing how much of your story is mistaken and / or based on assumptions. If this is seriously the way you intend to earn my heart back, it's doing the exact opposite. You know, I'd believe your assertions about Miriam more if you got your story and facts straight. This is the problem. You want me to believe what you're telling me, yet I know for a fact that you are telling me things based on misinformation. So, how do you expect me to believe what you say about her? Get the true facts and then I'll be more likely to believe you.
You claim I'm thinking with my penis and not my head. So, if Miriam is really working with Fawkes and Cria, and she would get a cut of the profits, why did she give me credits to help me get my Transverser back? This makes no sense! Second, we were not taking my Tranny to her house, not sure why you jumped to that conclusion, but you were wrong. I have my Transverser and it is safely parked on Acrylon. Go check it out! Actually, go track it! It's still available for you to track! So Fawkes has it? Really and his going to sell it? Really? Miriam is going to get a cut of the profits from a ship that Fawkes doesn't have possession of, but he's going to sell? Hmmm, doesn't seem very logical now does it? How is that going to work? I really hope Miriam gets a lot for that ship because she'd have to make sure she was going to at least get bak the 450 million credits she gave me to help get it back. Sorry Kitty, but I honestly doubt that Fawkes could get enough money  from selling my tranny to be able to pay Miriam, or anyone for that matter, more than 450 million credits and still keep a sizable profit.
I don't know who told you that Miriam sleeps with whomever she can, but since the two of us got together, she has never left my side except to go buy a hatch repair kit to fix my blown hatch on my tranny. So, who is she sleeping with while she's by my side? I'd be curious to know. I don't trust what people say about others all of the time. I need proof. Yes, there are devious, heartless and selfish people out there, but what tells you people don't just say things out of spite because they heard it from someone else? I want tangible evidence before making accusations. Otherwise, it's simply defaming someone's character without grounds, something I do not tolerate in the very least.
One last note, I now know who owns the house where Miriam and I are residing and they have not taken very nicely to the names you have called his house. For someone who doesn't want to make waves, you'll create some if you continue to call it what you have and I'll have nothing to do with it. So, you know what? Do yourself a favor and get your facts straight, do your research from reliable sources, gather your tangible evidence, and I consider believing your story. Otherwise, , I have no choice but to question it seeing as major ar
22:30 guments you have are invalid, incomplete, and / or inaccurate.

My dearest Love,
no, my impression of her are not based upon assumptions. I could
send you the transcript from conversations I have had where it was
said that she sleeps around. However nobody said I could relate
this and I don't break confidences. Of course she's not catting
for another man right now because you are her current
entertainment. So wake up and get off the defensive as I of
course initially did not think very highly of this individual you
are obsessing over but this statement was made voluntarily by this
person who you know quite well and from a couple of others who you
don't readily associate with. The persons themselves, well one who
you know quite well really would likely have no need to make
negative statements about her character as they are happily
involved. So don't you also make assumptions concerning my
assessment here. As what i have stated is factual.
450 Million is all she would give you? Well at least she offered
and did give you credits. no matter where you were going with the
Transverser, unless you know you can avoid predators like Fawkes,
Cria and others, then be certain that you jump as directly to the
desired sector as possible or enjoy being chased. I'm glad you got
it back. You don't see me cavorting my Transverser around the
sectors do you? It's for these same reasons. I love that ship
but it's an old one and I treasure it so I will treat it with
respect and care. If I happen to lose it, it won't be through
careless flying about in Locals where it's not needed in the first
place.
As for whose house it is, I really don't care but I am entitled to
my own opinion of the name. If I were to buy a house by that name,
I would change its name. It doesn't come across as being the least
bit romantic-sounding. It sounds like an old-fashioned whore house
and nothing more. Good that whomever it belongs to has another
idea but there's nothing elegant about the name of that house
whether you like my impression or or not, it is what it is. If
it's yours, then you know what i think.
I don't see that I should have to win your heart back if I truly
had it before. Again I thought I could believe in you and give you
more credit for being a committed and caring man. That you loved
me unconditionally which is obviously not the case. people who
truly love don't place the conditions on their love that you have
nor do they go out hunting sex to hurt their faithful partner.
This is just pure selfishness.
As for the character of this individual you are sleeping with, yes
I could have just let you continue to submit you over and over to
destructive and compromising circumstances and laughed. I know it
doesn't matter that I do care and I despise what she is doing to
you for you to get your sexual needs met. It sure sucks to be you
in this but it is clear that you are still controlled by your
22:31 
sexual organ and not logic at all.
I offered to take you out of comms merely to perhaps have some time
for us to work on things or we could have gone together and not
slept together. Knowing too that you've lost a bit, I would feel
guilty about going out and enjoying the total reward on my own yet
i honestly don't mind doing so. I just wanted to help you out but
again, she is not welcome nor will she ever be welcomed aboard my
ships or on my properties.
I love you Tibo,
Kitty

My Dearest Love,
This exchange took place and so believe what you want but you
yourself should checkout the facts and not from her as she is
obviously on the defensive but she has nothing worthwhile to
defend. I don't have time for her lies and mis-representations.
I'd end up deleting her link in a matter of minutes I'm sure..
She sure didn't sound very convincing when she said she didn't like
Fawkes and wow are you just naive. It's just amazing now that you
are so thick-headed.
These are the statements I received via Private about your mistress. Again you are in the worst case of denial because you are too afraid to admit it that you've made a very extremely poor judgement call in terms of trying to ditch me for a slut. Oh by the way, she did not help you the other day prior to the loss of your gunship and related. It was Amy who rescued you two and not her so don't mis-represent things. She is not your angel of rescue she can mouth all she wants to but I'm not the only one who sees through her lies and deceptions.
Here are the statements I heard myself and which were officially recorded on my communicator. You can't obtain anything more authentic than that!
[Private "yeah she's well...... going around with alot of guys"
(12-34 p.m.) [Private | "thanks i dont doubt if they are playing
him"
(12-42 p.m.) [Private | "trust me i'm not the only that thinks
it just
not much want to say"
(12-45 p.m.) [Private | 
22:31 "yes he has which has me surprised why
he
doesn't see what's going on"

Kitty,
Again, you are making no sense. My point in bringing up the fact that I got my tranny back is to point out that not all of your information is correct or complete. You were still under the impression that I had lost it and that Fawkes had it in his possession. See, your problem is that you  heard the first part of the story, but didn't ask questions about the rest. She only gave me 450 million because I wouldn't let her give me more. You assumed and jumped to conclusions. So, if that information was incorrect, it follows that other information you give me could be flawed. If the person you got your information from that Miriam sleeps around is the person I'm thinking of, then you don't know her side of the story. How fair is that? It's also someone who you claimed got me in trouble before and now you want to believe him. Seems someone isn't thinking with their head either.
Actually, there is something more authentic than communicator chatter. It's called first hand knowledge. You should try it some time. First of all, Amy was not in my gunship, trying to repair it and move it. When Fawkes docked with my gunship, it was Miriam who moved my gunship away from his ship. You see, this is more authentic. I was a witness to it. Yes, Amy  may have shown up in Ryan's BC, but it was Ryan's BC that saved us the first time and I didn't call for him. I don't even have a link with him. If I didn't call for him, then who did? He never responded over General. 
I'm not misrepresenting things. I never said that she was my rescuing angel. What I said was that she proved that she wasn't out to steal my ship then. I watched her every move on the internal stun turret cameras. She did fire on both of them and move my ship to try to keep it from being destroyed longer. You, and the other person, were probably not privy to the sector communication that took place either and again, this is proof that you refuse to consider all of the facts. You just focus on the facts that you want to.
What you don't know about the second attack is that we spent half the morning making Cria chase us around. It was Miriam's idea that had Cria jumping into the wrong sector at times. If she was really in league with him, why didn't she just tell him to jump to the sector I had started to jump to? He jumped back to the original sector and not to the new one I jumped to. Why didn't she just  have him wait in orbit when we launched and have him ready to shoot down my ship or have it all blockaded or what not? None of this happened. It would have been much easier and Miriam would have gotten paid so much faster if she had just led Cria to the sectors we planned to jump to, but Cria was never there and often took a couple of minutes to figure out where we had jumped to. Obviously, he got bad information or none at all.
According to the private communication transcripts you sent, Miriam is sleeping around with a lot of guys. This is in the present form as in it's happening right now. Yet, she has always been next to me except that one time to go fix my hatch on my Transverser. So obviously, do I believe what I see firsthand or what someone else says that they don't see  firsthand? I don't see her leaving to sleep with other people right now. Now if you had video recordings of her leaving while I am asleep or something to that degree, that would be tangible, authentic evidence. Hearsay is not. I also heard her ex-boyfriend through my droid basically tell her that they couldn't avoid each other forever. So obviously, he got the message that it's over. She didn't know where he was or that I had that particular droid remote in my hand.
Aside from humanity and it's existence and it's right to live, there are very few things I will defend with my life or my entire being. The right for people to defend their dignity and have their story heard. Too many events in history and in life have gone wrong because someone didn't listen to both sides of the story. It isn't fair, nor just and it is something I will not tolerate. It's judgmental to listen to half of the story and ignore the rest simply because you are angry.
This has nothing to do with whom I am dating. If people were saying things behind your back, even as much as I am angry at you right now, I believe you have the right to explain yourself and to defend your side. Yet, you don't allow others the same right. I cannot and will not be with someone who treats people that unfairly. 
Yes, you have the right to your opinion, but your opinion should be portrayed as just that, an opinion. Statements made in your letters were portrayed as factual. This is where it become defaming. It's one thing to say I believe someone is a thief. That would be an opinion. However, the moment you say that a person is a thief without tangible evidence, it becomes defamation of character and it is not something I will tolerate around me.
As to the name of the house, I could care less what you called it. I was just trying to warn you that they heard you insulted it. According to them, if you insult their house, you insult them too. I was just trying to warn you, but seems you aren't willing to listen to any reason either. So, at this point, further conversation is pointless. You believe you're right and refuse to listen to the whole story. You are willing to obtain information from biased sources and use only what will suit your purposes. If you don't have time to listen to all of the facts and give others the right to defend their side of the story, then I'm not going to give you the opportunity to defend your side of the story. then maybe, just maybe, someday when you need people to listen to your side, people won't listen either and maybe you'll know how it feels not to be listened to or be g
22:31 iven an opportunity to share your side.
You know, the reasons I left you go beyond sex and affection. It was also about how you handle disagreements, refuse to listen, over react, and get angry easily because I happen to ask too many questions. You almost turned our last trip out of locals around because I dared to question you. If you had simply explained why a given rule was there, I would have understood, but instead, you threatened to turn the ship around.
No, I didn't feel comfortable talking to you about affection or my problems with us not being intimate because I was afraid you would get angry. I figured that you'd just say that you weren't comfortable yet and you needed more time. I don't believe it would have changed anything. Life is too short and too hard to be uncomfortable with the one you love. I'm sorry Kitty, but any chances of us getting back together have vanished. I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
Tibo

Tibo my Dearest love,
All that i can say about your defensiveness is that only time will tell who is really being honest, faithful and truthful. What was transmitted to me was that she does sleep around and perhaps she isn't currently but trust me, it came from a reliable source who you may or may not be close to anymore and in fact it's someone you've defended before. Based upon how childishly she comes across, the honeymoon will grow sour before long. Anytime one rushes into wild intimacy, then what else is there left to discover?
The reason why I was wanting to turn the ship around was because yes, you wanted me to keep flying while engaging in other things in the ship away from the Control room. at that time, you were such a new pilot and I wasn't yet certain how you could assist me should a Muzano or otherwise emerge. now, i would be very comfortable with you and certainly would take time out to enjoy our hot tub and oh so much more. I have already faught hard battles alone and I have lost enough out in deep space. It took me months to recoup enough to get another gunship upgraded and then my Dart was stolen. So kindly please try to see where I was coming from? Also, I wasn't quite ready to be intimate with you. I don't believe in using intimacy to get what I need and I never have. For all that i knew, when we got back, you could have taken the credits you earned and gone your own way. Also what if I had done the same and just used you sexually?
Tibo, I'm not always right too yet I certainly am strong-willed and believe in what I believe and you know, you just needed to persist and accept it that I might not always agree with you. i have changed my mind, my opinion and other things many times and it's so sad that you make it an excuse not to have wanted to try. Honestly, I believe you would have been quite surprised in the end had you spoken up for whatever you felt strongly about. i have grown to respect you moreso as you have emerged as a great pilot. I have certainly held back on expressing my thoughts on some of the actions you have taken. I wasn't in favor of your joining Insanity for one but I felt that you had to make your own choices concerning which organization you elected to join. I felt that they would likely have stopped bothering you after a point had you not joined insanity but since you left, that just provided fawkes and company another excuse to hunt you. Still, you did what you thought was right for you and I don't hold it against you. I'm sad that it has turned out the way it has in terms of Fawkes and company and in spite of their downfall too. Nobody is right all of the time either and I sure am not. I but just as you are in such disagreement with me right now. You won't admit it that you've made a serious mistake with us.I'm sad for you and especially us. I know that you will soon get away from the clutches of this individual who sounds like a 3-year old screaming on Chatter. What sort of substance is there in 3-year-old behavior?
Again I'm as I said, I'm glad that you got your Transverser back and that i was wrong concerning how it was being used or transported.
I still believe her actions were just to win you over and that it's only a matter of time what her true intentions really are. If someone wants to take advantage, they aren't typically going to do their dirty work up front. They will win your trust and then they have you exactly where they want you. She certainly isn't going to admit to you what her intentions are no matter how you confront her either so I just laughed the other day when she went all emo on Chatter. Her very defensiveness was a tell all that she had been caught out and I laughed thinking who is she trying to fool except you of course?
As I told you on our private link. I'm still here for you and I love you and I love you sincerely and not for just what I was looking forward to as the most wonderful experience with you. It still hurts that when I couldn't be available that you are using it against me. If you had personal reasons why you couldn't work or be available for me, I would not turn my back on you. I would not leave you because we all have times when we are not at our best or when we in our top form. Still if we were to marry, there is a vow which states that you love one another through thick an
22:32 d thin and through better or worse and many other things. If we were to have married are you not committed to those things? Well I am my Darling.
I love you forever.
Your forever faithful and loving,
Kitty

Kitty,
Im writing this letter as a last resort. If you truly love me, then I need you to act like it and at least give me the dignity of listening to my side of the story.
Cria and Fawkes have been hunting me ever since I joined the Calaway's organization. Fawkes took it personally that I left without telling him. Around the same time or soon thereafter, Anton fired on my expediter. Not my gunship, but my expediter. I almost lost my expediter several times coming into sector 15 because of all of the automated laser turrets that were frequently being put there. This is why I started flying around in a gunship as the gunship was able to withstand the laser fire and get me safely to Empanda. Maybe you disagree with the fact that I was flying around in a gunship, but that is why. I at least need you to understand.
If I am truly a coward, then why did people not call me that after I left with you and the Calaway's to go get their gunship? It was clearly my ship and we left out of sector 5. This happened after I was already being hunted by Cria and Fawkes. The next time I left to go out of locals was last month when I left out of sector 37. Remembering what you told me about the transverser not being a very good combat ship should we run into Praelor in deep space, I followed what you taught me by taking my gunship which I had upgraded for exploration. I left out of sector 37 intending to go to Celestia located Northwest and up from sector 37. I brought my tranny since I had no other ship that had medical facilities if Miriam and I had been injured in any way. I docked it in the gunship so that if we ran into Praelor on the way to Celestia, I could solo the gunship easier if need be. I also docked my fighter as a back up plan.
So no, I was not just transporting my tranny over to Miriam's place. I was trying to go to Celestia so that I could do some atmospheric salvaging there and had brought my tranny and fighter for the reasons above. The first time I attempted to leave, Cria and Fawkes showed up in their battle cruiser and heliogaster respectively. I asked for assistance and so did Miriam as she was with me. Ryan eventually showed up in his BC and by coordinating with us, we managed to jump out. 
I attempted it again a few days later and Cria chased me out of sector 37 again. This time, we saw him coming and jumped out before he got to us to another sector. The third time is when my gunship was blown up and I temporarily lost my tranny.
To those who call me a coward, it is important to choose your battles and to them I ask, "Who is the real coward?" Is it me with the least experience, or the ones with years experience fighting other pilots and purposefully out numbering the less experienced pilot? I would say it is the latter. It takes no courage whatsoever to fight an adversary that you know you have out gunned, and out numbered. That's truly a coward's act in my book. It takes more courage, maturity and more humility to talk with people instead of just throwing fists, so to speak.
So I don't care who calls me a coward. They should look at themselves first. You invited me out of locals soon after we broke up which would have probably coincided with the time I ended up leaving. Would I have been a coward then? I refuse to live my life in locals, because blood thirsty warmongers want me to. I joined the pilot corps to explore deep space, not to follow the whim, wants, desires, and irrational behavior of those who can't use words to negotiate and would rather just slug it out in a back alley. It's not my style and I refuse to bow down to that.
So, if you truly love me, and since you're obviously in contact with those people hunting me. You can pass on my message. Seems like you'd rather kiss their butts instead of give me the least bit of consideration or the benefit of the doubt.
If the roles were reversed, I would do what ever it took to defend you if I truly loved you. I would give anything to protect you and uphold your dignity and pride. I would give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to your side completely before making any judgements. You have done none of this. Cria and Fawkes and the people who call me cowards refuse to use this thing called words to negotiate with me. They tell you instead of telling me and what do you tell them? You agree wit
22:32 h them, right? You question what I did without even knowing all of the facts. You assume that I'm just this little doggy that Miriam has wrapped around her little finger. Well, think twice. If you really think that, then you obviously didn't know me very well.
After you found out that my gunship got blown up, you immediately began to reprimand me. You barely offered any sympathy or gave me a chance to explain myself. So you know what? I don't feel the love tonight. You can tell me all you want, but you need to show me. Not just tell me.

22:33 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty to Tibo - 8-6-2363]

My Dearest Love,
First off, I haven't had a link with Fawkes in literally months.
As for Cria, I rarely have spoken with him with the very rare
chance that I am on HiGuard for a mission. This has been probably
a couple of months ago. So do not! accuse me of kissing anybody's
butt Tibo. I just try to get along with them by not being caustic
or hostile and sometimes just plain old avoidance is what you have
to do. I truly don't think though that I am safe around any of
them and I'm sure they will likely try to take advantage of me when
they have the opportunity to do so. I don't know why too you would
even imply that i bother to pay anyone to cause you any harm. I
don't work that way and especially towards someone i love as much
as i love you. The only time I will go aggressive towards anyone
is when they have first attacked me. Even then, I generally just
move on as it's not worth the aggrevation until I find that
individual when they least expect it and return by breaking their
bones! Then I owe them absolutely nothing and being nice isn't my
plan! Otherwise, as you know, I'd rather make love than war as I
so want to make love with you.
I will tell you though that you have a bit of manning up to do and
I know you don't like it but still, when others see one flying
around in a gunship, their assumption is and always will be that
they are wanting to fight or at least are able to defend their
starship. Believe me if you want to but I have had enough years of
having my bones broken, ships stolen, attempts at extortion and
blown up ships to decide that I am not going to be a prisoner in my
ship, etc unless I have other reasons for not coming out. When I
am able to work, I go about my business and I face the consequences
of whatever is in my path. I am not the combat pilot I used to be
so I know I can't defend a gunship as I once could so guess what, I
choose not to fly a ship around which costs a few billion credits.
That makes no sense! I'd rather lose one which I have 100
million invested in which is more expendable as it is a hostile
Universe out there and is not likely to ever change. So your
stating you got shot at in your Expediter comes across as whining.
Hey you sure have a short memory when it comes to things.
remember one of my own Expediters launched right into a mine field.
That same Expediter was shot at several times but did it stop me
when I was more active? I was just angry concerning how very new
pilots who only had a few credits earned were in the line of fire.
I just would either accept my loss and go buy another one or use
one I have in reserve as I keep a few. I can tell you lots of
stories of being entrapped and other things but it's no reason to
blame the universe for all of my problems. People respect you
moreso when you at least try to look at your own actions and decide
to just keep doing what you do and to accept the consequences or
use a different strategy. This is probably why you have been
called a coward and no I didn't hear this from Cria or Fawkes
because I absolutely do not communicate with them privately. Nope.
So love, I don't think you deserve any sympathy over your losses
based upon poor judgement. Nobody has given me any except to
perhaps offer to sell me another ship which I may or may have not
accepted. I am sorry for your losses but not still for what I
consider chosing the wrong time of day to go out of locals. Still,
rather than hold yourself accountable all I heard in your letter
was blame this one and blame that one and nothing about hey what
could have i done to evade them or to choose a time to depart or to
not let anyone know when I was leaving/ You know I never tell
anybody what my plans are either and I I showed you measures which
I hope you observed en route. There are pilots whose sport is to
challenge anyone who will to combat. Although it is inconvenient
to us, that's their sport and when you take it personally, this
just feeds their egos. Haven't you heard Anton challenging others
before? For him, it's fun and although you don't see it that way
and I find it to be a royal pain in the butt, that is how it is.
so i certainly understand wanting to take a stronger ship into
Sector 12 if there is an Invasion but there is also the ITPN
particularly when there is that much hostile activity in the
sector. A good practice too is that BCs should actually be taken
to Jump Hub or another neutral location as well to crew but isn't
always done. So don't point fingers at me! I'm trying to relate
some practical survival advice to you yet you always seem to resent
it when someone like myself has had a bit of life and survival
experience and your not wanting to accept and to listen will not
help you much. only you can decide that perhaps there are others
who do know something based upon real experience.
As for the exact circumstances of your lost gunship, still, you
need to step back and get off of the defensive and accept it that
you indeed made tactical errors. That if others such as myself
consider how you mis-managed things don't agree with you, then that
is how it is. It does not mean that I love you any less. However,
I'm not very impressed with the logic behind what you have done at
times. You have lost two gunships in less than a half a year. I
sympathize with the loss of your droids as that was just a mean-
spirited thing on the part of that jerk.
As I have told you before, going to a commonly hunted ground out of
37 is not wise. If you do so, then you need to be willing to take
on the adversities. It is unfortunate but it is just a reality of
being a pilot in this universe. Nobody promised us that we would
live a perfect life here without any challenges.
As for going out of locals, you know I don't do that to run away
but because i enjoy it. still, others perception of you is when
you are angry or upset, that is what you do. As it's typical of
others who are newer pilots and don't engage in pilot versus pilot
combat. I'm not saying you should, just what is the perception
right or wrong.
You know exactly why I choose to go where nobody else goes to
Aquatic, Atmo and Gas salvage. Although it would be fun to be in a
community setting, it's just asking to be attacked so why put
yourself in that position? It's like here I am boys and girls!
come get me! That makes no sense at all! However, if you can
defend your ship and resources, then go where you want to go and be
ready to fight if you have to.
You need to remind yourself exactly why I wanted to take you out of
Locals as it was to enjoy some quality time with you and to not
have any interference so that we could make an attempt to work out
our differences.
Since I had so little quality time withyou until you ran off with
that self-serving individual who yes, how hypocritical, is not
available as much as i was and am. You said she was right by your
side heh well after what 4 days she hasn't been right there by your
side? So a very unfounded justification to hold over my head. I
might have been away for a day or so but I always came right back
to be right there with you. On many occasions, I would be
available for you and wait for at least an hour or two for you to
come home and then it seemed convenient that you wanted me to
become more intimate when you well knew I would sleep soon. It
makes me wonder if it's you who didn't want to take the time to
become more intimate. Still Love, I'd truly like to know what it
would be like to make love with you.
As for supporting you and upholding your dignity, then you will
always have every ounce of my very being to support you if I truly
know that you are using your head and reasonable judgement. Then
you are dignified and deserve to be respected. If you were still
here so I could be by your side, yes I would fight for you but I
nor anyone can't fight battles over circumstances that you created.
You know that I was not in favor of your joining Insanity but you
did so without even discussing it and I suppose had you done so
and I opposed it, that you would have just stomped out angrily,
slammed the door and then perhaps I could just say 'I told you so'.
You know I was initially tempted to join but thought better of it
as I knew that all they would want to do would be to exploit me.
That is one thing that Matt never did to me nor anyone in Force.
He didn't like families and cliques either although couples were
ok. He had some very sound ideas and he did not exploit anyone but
one thing about Matt which was of utmost importance is loyalty. I
did not get the sense that Cria or Fawkes cared anything about
loyalty which is another reason I did not choose to join. I will
likely remain as a member of Force until it is gone or if Matt
comes back and a group of great pilots and a few pirates band
together once again.
So sorry my sweet love, love is tough at times and it should be
because if I continuously supported certain aspects, then how do
you consider this to help you out? It is what they call enabling.
That is not support. Still, if Ihappened to be flying with you and
you were under attack, I wouldn't just sit back and let it happen
to you. If you are implying that I can do anything about Cria and
Fawkes, well sorry Love, I'm in no better circumstances than you.
I know that ifever i let my guard down, they will find a way to
take advantage. When they do though, I will either find a means to
retaliate which is highly unlikely or accept the consequences and
reflect and consider what I should do and defintiely should do
different to prevent a reoccurance of the same circumstances. I
may not succeed but there is nobody to blame but myself for
creating a situation for myself which left me vulnerable. I
wouldn't blame you as you are so hurtfully are blaming me for your
problems. I am accountable to Kitty and if someone loves her and
is available to help her then she is forever grateful. If they
aren't or choose not to, then I don't hold it against them.
You have a

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

22:37 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty to Tibo - 8-6-2363]

My Dearest Love,
First off, I haven't had a link with Fawkes in literally months.
As for Cria, I rarely have spoken with him with the very rare
chance that I am on HiGuard for a mission. This has been probably
a couple of months ago. So do not! accuse me of kissing anybody's
butt Tibo. I just try to get along with them by not being caustic
or hostile and sometimes just plain old avoidance is what you have
to do. I truly don't think though that I am safe around any of
them and I'm sure they will likely try to take advantage of me when
they have the opportunity to do so. I don't know why too you would
even imply that i bother to pay anyone to cause you any harm. I
don't work that way and especially towards someone i love as much
as i love you. The only time I will go aggressive towards anyone
is when they have first attacked me. Even then, I generally just
move on as it's not worth the aggrevation until I find that
individual when they least expect it and return by breaking their
bones! Then I owe them absolutely nothing and being nice isn't my
plan! Otherwise, as you know, I'd rather make love than war as I
so want to make love with you.
I will tell you though that you have a bit of manning up to do and
I know you don't like it but still, when others see one flying
around in a gunship, their assumption is and always will be that
they are wanting to fight or at least are able to defend their
starship. Believe me if you want to but I have had enough years of
having my bones broken, ships stolen, attempts at extortion and
blown up ships to decide that I am not going to be a prisoner in my
ship, etc unless I have other reasons for not coming out. When I
am able to work, I go about my business and I face the consequences
of whatever is in my path. I am not the combat pilot I used to be
so I know I can't defend a gunship as I once could so guess what, I
choose not to fly a ship around which costs a few billion credits.
That makes no sense! I'd rather lose one which I have 100
million invested in which is more expendable as it is a hostile
Universe out there and is not likely to ever change. So your
stating you got shot at in your Expediter comes across as whining.
Hey you sure have a short memory when it comes to things.
remember one of my own Expediters launched right into a mine field.
That same Expediter was shot at several times but did it stop me
when I was more active? I was just angry concerning how very new
pilots who only had a few credits earned were in the line of fire.
I just would either accept my loss and go buy another one or use
one I have in reserve as I keep a few. I can tell you lots of
stories of being entrapped and other things but it's no reason to
blame the universe for all of my problems. People respect you
moreso when you at least try to look at your own actions and decide
to just keep doing what you do and to accept the consequences or
use a different strategy. This is probably why you have been
called a coward and no I didn't hear this from Cria or Fawkes
because I absolutely do not communicate with them privately. Nope.
So love, I don't think you deserve any sympathy over your losses
based upon poor judgement. Nobody has given me any except to
perhaps offer to sell me another ship which I may or may have not
accepted. I am sorry for your losses but not still for what I
consider chosing the wrong time of day to go out of locals. Still,
rather than hold yourself accountable all I heard in your letter
was blame this one and blame that one and nothing about hey what
could have i done to evade them or to choose a time to depart or to
not let anyone know when I was leaving/ You know I never tell
anybody what my plans are either and I I showed you measures which
I hope you observed en route. There are pilots whose sport is to
challenge anyone who will to combat. Although it is inconvenient
to us, that's their sport and when you take it personally, this
just feeds their egos. Haven't you heard Anton challenging others
before? For him, it's fun and although you don't see it that way
and I find it to be a royal pain in the butt, that is how it is.
so i certainly understand wanting to take a stronger ship into
Sector 12 if there is an Invasion but there is also the ITPN
particularly when there is that much hostile activity in the
sector. A good practice too is that BCs should actually be taken
to Jump Hub or another neutral location as well to crew but isn't
always done. So don't point fingers at me! I'm trying to relate
some practical survival advice to you yet you always seem to resent
it when someone like myself has had a bit of life and survival
experience and your not wanting to accept and to listen will not
help you much. only you can decide that perhaps there are others
who do know something based upon real experience.
As for the exact circumstances of your lost gunship, still, you
need to step back and get off of the defensive and accept it that
you indeed made tactical errors. That if others such as myself
consider how you mis-managed things don't agree with you, then that
is how it is. It does not mean that I love you any less. However,
I'm not very impressed with the logic behind what you have done at
times. You have lost two gunships in less than a half a year. I
sympathize with the loss of your droids as that was just a mean-
spirited thing on the part of that jerk.
As I have told you before, going to a commonly hunted ground out of
37 is not wise. If you do so, then you need to be willing to take
on the adversities. It is unfortunate but it is just a reality of
being a pilot in this universe. Nobody promised us that we would
live a perfect life here without any challenges.
As for going out of locals, you know I don't do that to run away
but because i enjoy it. still, others perception of you is when
you are angry or upset, that is what you do. As it's typical of
others who are newer pilots and don't engage in pilot versus pilot
combat. I'm not saying you should, just what is the perception
right or wrong.
You know exactly why I choose to go where nobody else goes to
Aquatic, Atmo and Gas salvage. Although it would be fun to be in a
community setting, it's just asking to be attacked so why put
yourself in that position? It's like here I am boys and girls!
come get me! That makes no sense at all! However, if you can
defend your ship and resources, then go where you want to go and be
ready to fight if you have to.
You need to remind yourself exactly why I wanted to take you out of
Locals as it was to enjoy some quality time with you and to not
have any interference so that we could make an attempt to work out
our differences.
Since I had so little quality time withyou until you ran off with
that self-serving individual who yes, how hypocritical, is not
available as much as i was and am. You said she was right by your
side heh well after what 4 days she hasn't been right there by your
side? So a very unfounded justification to hold over my head. I
might have been away for a day or so but I always came right back
to be right there with you. On many occasions, I would be
available for you and wait for at least an hour or two for you to
come home and then it seemed convenient that you wanted me to
become more intimate when you well knew I would sleep soon. It
makes me wonder if it's you who didn't want to take the time to
become more intimate. Still Love, I'd truly like to know what it
would be like to make love with you.
As for supporting you and upholding your dignity, then you will
always have every ounce of my very being to support you if I truly
know that you are using your head and reasonable judgement. Then
you are dignified and deserve to be respected. If you were still
here so I could be by your side, yes I would fight for you but I
nor anyone can't fight battles over circumstances that you created.
You know that I was not in favor of your joining Insanity but you
did so without even discussing it and I suppose had you done so
and I opposed it, that you would have just stomped out angrily,
slammed the door and then perhaps I could just say 'I told you so'.
You know I was initially tempted to join but thought better of it
as I knew that all they would want to do would be to exploit me.
That is one thing that Matt never did to me nor anyone in Force.
He didn't like families and cliques either although couples were
ok. He had some very sound ideas and he did not exploit anyone but
one thing about Matt which was of utmost importance is loyalty. I
did not get the sense that Cria or Fawkes cared anything about
loyalty which is another reason I did not choose to join. I will
likely remain as a member of Force until it is gone or if Matt
comes back and a group of great pilots and a few pirates band
together once again.
So sorry my sweet love, love is tough at times and it should be
because if I continuously supported certain aspects, then how do
you consider this to help you out? It is what they call enabling.
That is not support. Still, if Ihappened to be flying with you and
you were under attack, I wouldn't just sit back and let it happen
to you. If you are implying that I can do anything about Cria and
Fawkes, well sorry Love, I'm in no better circumstances than you.
I know that ifever i let my guard down, they will find a way to
take advantage. When they do though, I will either find a means to
retaliate which is highly unlikely or accept the consequences and
reflect and consider what I should do and defintiely should do
different to prevent a reoccurance of the same circumstances. I
may not succeed but there is nobody to blame but myself for
creating a situation for myself which left me vulnerable. I
wouldn't blame you as you are so hurtfully are blaming me for your
problems. I am accountable to Kitty and if someone loves her and
is available to help her then she is forever grateful. If they
aren't or choose not to, then I don't hold it against them.
You have a 
22:37 Welcome to Miriani!

My dearest Love,
Well it has likewise come the time for me to tell you that if you were telling me the truth all along, then you wouldn't truly be a coward that you are being and leave piloting. Yes you cheated with a cheater so you got what you truly deserved now. I hope I never find your mistress alone as now I will truly get revenge for destroying as she obviously has or you would come back to me. She has brainwashed you so horribly as well. You wer cheating on me before that night that you faked a breakup with me to try to cover yourself. You obviously had contact with her and a plan to move in. That is cheating as who knows how long and then you moved in with her in some other man's home. That is so disgusting and so disrespectful of the spirit and to the owner of the property especially if it is a boyfriend or former boyfriend.
So either come back to me and face me or be on your way Tibo Beauchene or the memory I will have of you will be only of a cheater who wouldn't admit to his wrongs, a coward who wouldn't hold himself accountable for his stupid mistakes in judgement and obviously one who couldn't encourage a decent woman like me to trust him and consumate her love with you. At least i was correct in that you would prove yourself untrustworthy.
I did offer to forgive you and to make an effort to be with you one on one to work out our differences. Cowards only run and hide behind their broken promises and lies though rather than face those whom they have hurt.
I always felt that you were hiding something and I know now that you are just a user whom i obviously couldn't resist so that is my fault for allowing it. If you weren't, you would be back in my arms. I suppose there is some remote glint of guilt on your behalf there because you are so compeled to run away and throw your career away rather than admit to your wrongs and apologize to me.
You lashed out at me for your problems too which means you still can't see through your own lack of accountability. I am the one you can trust though but it's so painful that you would blame me rather than admit it that you yourself are responsible for your failures.
it's sad for you Tibo Beauchene and my heart will miss you forever but we pilots certainly don't need another dishonest cheater amongst us women who only desire a good and honest companion. I wanted to marry you and I still do but my intuition told me I should wait and I am so right that you haven't the decency to face me.
I will say to you one last time, that the door is still open and especially for you to come back to me and prove that I am wrong. One other thing Tibo though is you are to show me that you are truly a man of integrity. You will also cease blaming me for what others do to you as well. You know Tibo,you just don't realize who your friends truly are as well and especially that I am not a cheater like Miriam Val
22:37 leris who cheted on her boyfriend to break us up. If you come back to me, I will leave her to her miserable life sleeping around with any man she wants though. She truly has the blackest heart and soul as she has no comprehension of guilt for the destruction in her path.
I will be sad forever Tibo and I may never get over it if you don't come back and at least try to work things out with me. Still, if you won't, I can't blame myself for your turning your back on me and running away to cover your wrongs.
I still love you with my heart because true love never dies.
Kitty

23:40 ["Magical Melody" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. You see a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset and a twinkling strand of blue lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
