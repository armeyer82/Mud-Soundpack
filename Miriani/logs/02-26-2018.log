You can go south.

00:42 You can't go that way.

00:42 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:42 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

00:42 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

00:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:42 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

00:42 The ship is already moving.

00:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:42 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

00:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:42 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:42 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Can tradesman pets die?

00:42 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

00:42 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

00:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:42 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

00:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:42 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:42 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

00:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

00:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

00:43 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the five-person transverser "Curious Creature" powered down here.

00:44 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

01:00 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

01:38 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.

03:54 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

03:54 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

03:54 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

03:54 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

03:54 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Two planets have been detected in the sector."

03:54 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:54 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

["Retaliation" Weapons Room 8] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable black leather combat chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. A tall black freestanding fan is emanating a cool breeze throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the black tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfortable black leather combat chair, a curvy glass lamp with black lava churning inside, a tall black freestanding fan, and a hologram of an animated rock band projected in the middle of the room here.
You can go east.

03:54 The cannons are already loaded.

03:55 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:55 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

03:55 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:55 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:55 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

03:55 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

03:55 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

03:55 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

03:55 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:55 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:55 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

03:55 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:55 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:55 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:55 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

04:16 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

04:16 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

04:16 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

04:16 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

04:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:17 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

10:24 You can't go that way.

10:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

10:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

10:24 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

10:24 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

10:24 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

10:24 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

10:24 The ship is already moving.

10:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

10:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

10:24 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

10:24 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.
A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

10:24 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

10:24 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

10:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

10:24 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

10:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

10:24 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

10:24 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

10:24 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

10:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

10:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

10:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

10:47 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Could be map. I know there's something that lets you know if there's someone detected close by. Its probably map, but it only gives your coords if there's nobody.

19:33 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here, sleeping.
You can go south.
