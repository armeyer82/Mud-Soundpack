02:32 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.

You can go south and out.

02:32 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:32 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

02:32 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:32 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:32 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:32 The ship is already moving.

02:32 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:32 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:32 Enter a destination:

02:32 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:32 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:32 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:32 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:32 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 14, 10."

02:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:32 The starship is already moving.

02:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:32 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:32 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

02:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:33 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:33 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

You can go south and out.

02:47 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:47 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

02:47 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:47 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:48 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:48 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:48 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:48 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:48 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:48 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 14, 10."

02:48 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:48 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

02:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:48 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:48 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

This small, cramped, dingy office is littered with dusty filing cabinets, scraps of paper, and an unmistakable sense of gloom. The floor is scuffed in several places, the walls are windowless, and two tiny desks stand front to front in the middle of the room, each piled high with unimportant looking paper. A vandalized sign instructs visitors to 'Asses the MENU', presumably meant to say access.

02:53 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

02:53 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:53 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:53 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

02:53 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:53 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:53 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:53 The one-person expediter "Skysong" has left the sector.

02:53 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:53 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

02:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:53 The ship must be in space to do that.

02:53 The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:53 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

02:53 Invalid selection.

02:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:53 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:54 The starship is already moving.

02:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

02:54 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:54 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

10:52 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

11:09 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

11:09 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

11:09 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

11:09 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

11:09 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

11:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

11:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

11:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

11:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

11:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

11:09 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

11:09 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

11:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

11:09 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

11:09 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

11:09 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

11:10 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

11:10 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

11:10 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

11:10 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

11:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

11:10 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

11:10 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

11:10 You must stand up first.

11:10 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

11:10 You must stand up first.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

You can go south and out.

12:52 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:52 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:52 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:52 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:52 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:52 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:52 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:52 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:52 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:52 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:52 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:52 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

12:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:52 The starship is already moving.

12:52 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:52 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

12:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:53 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see Anny Rain here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:05 Anny Rain staggers south.

13:05 Anny Rain's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "engineer"

13:05 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:05 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:05 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:05 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "And I will attempt to fly."

13:05 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has initiated an intrasector slip.

13:05 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:05 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:05 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

13:05 [Private | Emily McManomy] Emily McManomy transmits, "good morning"

13:05 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

13:05 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:05 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:05 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:06 Ray Ridgeway presses a button, calling up the damage report.

13:06 Ray Ridgeway ambles up.

13:06 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Oops, forgot about the slip drive."

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

13:18 ["Fatal Destiny" Control Room]
You can go south, up, and out.

13:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:18 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has launched from Rolukssica.

13:18 Anny Rain staggers in from the south.

13:18 Anny Rain staggers up.

13:18 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:18 Anny Rain's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "weapon room"

13:18 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

13:18 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:18 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

13:19 Ray Ridgeway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "excellent!"

13:19 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Guarding storage."

13:19 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

13:19 You press a small button mounted on the wall and chuckle.

13:19 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:19 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:19 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has initiated an intrasector slip.

13:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:19 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

13:19 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:19 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

13:19 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:19 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:19 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "We'll see which way this works better. I'll let you make that final call, but...we had 2 turs over 30%, which...if she'd been watching, is theoretically not possible. And, all comps are fixed."

13:19 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

13:19 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:19 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "Ok, thanks."

13:31 Ray Ridgeway ambles south.

13:31 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

13:32 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

13:32 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Everyone ready?"

13:32 You press a large yellow button.

13:32 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to yellow.

13:32 You peer up and see...

13:32 ["Fatal Destiny" Weapons Room]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You can go down.

13:32 Ray Ridgeway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "you know it!"

13:32 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

13:32 Anny Rain says, "uuuuuu" into a small microphone mounted on the wall.

13:32 Anny Rain staggers up.

13:32 You grin.

13:32 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

13:32 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:32 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has launched from Rolukssica.

13:32 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

13:32 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:32 Anny Rain staggers in from up.

13:32 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

13:32 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:32 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:32 Anny Rain asks, "can i try flying?"

13:32 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:33 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:33 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has initiated an intrasector slip.

13:33 You ask, "Have you ever flown before?"

13:33 Anny Rain says, "yes,fighter"

13:33 You say, "ok"

13:33 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "Everyone has a little different gunning technique. I damage with turrets initially, then switch to cannons to kill the bugs. This takes slightly more time, but is cheaper for the captain. She, I do believe, is all cannons. Neither is wrong, just...different."

13:33 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Anny is going to fly this one."

13:33 Anny Rain presses a button on a navigation console and examines the display.

13:33 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "would you rather gun, or eng?"

13:33 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

13:34 #$#soundpack environment starship space | powered | safe | light

13:34 ["Fatal Destiny" Weapons Room]

13:34 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:34 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

13:34 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

13:34 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "I'd rather gun."

13:34 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

13:34 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:34 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:34 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "awesome!"

13:34 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

13:34 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:34 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:34 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

13:34 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "And yeah, I'm more cannons on a cruiser, but yeah. Everyone is different."

13:35 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "If the ship stops moving suddenly, one of us will have to try and catch it. Means her connection dropped. Doesn't happen often, but...on ocasion."

13:35 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "Yeah, I'll watch."

13:35 Ray Ridgeway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "And, all reps are finished."

13:45 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:45 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has launched from Rolukssica.

13:45 ["Fatal Destiny" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see Anny Rain here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:45 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

13:45 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:46 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:46 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:46 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:46 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:46 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has initiated an intrasector slip.

13:46 You ask Anny Rain, "Go gun?"

13:46 You grin.

13:46 Anny Rain says, "ok"

13:46 Anny Rain staggers up.

13:46 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:46 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:46 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The three-person cruiser "Fatal Destiny" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

13:46 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:46 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:46 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:46 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

13:46 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:01 #$#soundpack social | yawn | female

15:01 Amy Draksen yawns over the intercom.

15:01 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:01 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has launched from Rolukssica.

15:01 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:01 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

15:01 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:02 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:02 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:02 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:02 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:02 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has initiated an intrasector slip.

15:02 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:02 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:02 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

15:02 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:02 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:02 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:02 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:02 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

15:02 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:02 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:02 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:02 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

15:02 You press a large yellow button.

15:17 ["Critical Strike" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You can go south and out.

15:29 ["Critical Strike" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see Amy Draksen here.
You can go south and out.

15:29 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Giving Amy a moment."

15:30 [ Amy Draksen shatters immersion and says, "ready" ]

15:30 Amy Draksen saunters south.

15:30 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:30 Amy Draksen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "let's rock it"

15:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:30 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has launched from Rolukssica.

15:30 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Here we go."

15:30 [Private | Therman Donaldson] Therman Donaldson transmits, "allow me to rephrase the question. when i shoot the cannons, how many shots for 20 units is it? do i get 10, or do i get 20?"

15:30 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

15:30 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:31 [Private | Therman Donaldson] You transmit, "10 per cannon I believe."

15:31 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:31 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:31 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:31 [Private | Therman Donaldson] You transmit, "So, you'll get 10 shots."

15:31 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has initiated an intrasector slip.

15:31 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:31 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:31 [Private | Therman Donaldson] Therman Donaldson transmits, "os that will give me a max of 10 shots since there are 20 units. ok"

15:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

15:31 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:31 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:31 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:31 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:31 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

15:31 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:31 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:31 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:45 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the one-person interceptor "Black Whisper" powered down here.

This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

15:50 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:51 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:51 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

17:13 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

17:13 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

18:36 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pax; Neutral Docking Bay.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

18:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

18:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

18:36 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

18:36 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

18:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

18:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:36 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:36 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:36 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

18:36 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:36 The ship must be in space to do that.

18:36 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

18:36 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:36 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

18:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:36 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

18:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:37 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:37 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

18:48 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.

19:49 Garages
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Garages are structures that allow safe and convenient storage of your starship when you're not using it.

  Usage:
To place your ship in a garage, you simply power it down on the landing pad of a planet that is equipped with a garage. The following commands can be used on a landing pad to manipulate garages:

TRANSPORT <ship name> - This command allows you to put an unpowered ship into a garage or, if you're in the garage yourself, move a ship to the landing pad. If you don't specify a ship name, you will receive a length list of all possible ships to transport.

REQUEST <ship name> ON KEYRING - This command allows you to transport your ship from the garage without that lengthy walk to transport it.

19:51 Private Garages
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Private garages allow starship pilots to store their ships in a place that is their own. They retain full control over it at all times.

  Obtaining:
To obtain a private garage, you must either own a house, a space station, or be a donator and own an apartment on Empanda. If you're a house or station person, you can obtain a garage through your house builder. If you're a donator, you can build a garage the same way you built the other rooms in your apartment, through the MENU command. It's worth noting, however, that you cannot use your garage until your apartment is finalized.

  Commands:
MENU - In the garage, the menu will allow the owner to authorize people to land in the garage, unauthorize people, and expel ships from the garage to the landing pad.

RETRIEVE <ship name> ON KEYRING - Similar to the request command, this will pull your ship out of a private garage if somebody has been nefarious and tried to steal your ship and hide it in their garage.

GARAGE-OPTIONS - Allows you to set various options regarding private garages, including whether or not you wish to be prompted to land in a public garage when both are available.

23:00 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You see Kitty Mars (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go south, down, and out.
