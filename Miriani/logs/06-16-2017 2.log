00:00:03 Jason Rat nods.

00:00:13 Morris Corlew asks, "Oh...k?"

00:01:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

00:02:50 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

00:05:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Goodness. All of these weird arguments."

00:05:44 Melinda says to Ather, "They are weird."

00:05:50 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

00:06:00 Ather says to Melinda, "Give me a sandwich wrapper so I can write Pierre smells again."

00:06:04 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

00:06:07 Melinda Michaels grins.

00:06:08 Ather Jammoa takes a bite of a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

00:06:55 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

00:08:34 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

00:08:34 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

00:09:07 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

00:09:14 Vernos Bailey gives a wrapped turkey sandwich to Ather Jammoa.

00:09:17 Ather hmms.

00:09:20 Ather Jammoa carefully unwraps a turkey sandwich.

00:09:28 Vernos Bailey says, "You have to eat the sandwich though for the wrapper."

00:09:40 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Oh well! It will be glorious secondary meal. I will do this!"

00:09:43 Ather Jammoa takes several bites of a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.

00:09:45 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

00:10:17 Ather Jammoa says, "I guess the only difference is I don't give them to people. I like putting them where everyone can see them."

00:10:20 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

00:10:25 Ather Jammoa retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of the bowl and slurps them up.

00:10:36 Lily Kaise nods to Ather Jammoa.

00:10:37 Ather Jammoa tips the bowl into his mouth and drinks the richly flavored broth, finishing it off.

00:10:40 Vernos says to Ather, "The one someone put in my hands the other day was nasty worded."

00:10:52 Ather Jammoa removes a serving of room temperature chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl from an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

00:10:53 Morris says to Vernos, "What'd it say?"

00:10:57 Ather Jammoa puts a serving of room temperature chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl on an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

00:11:01 Ather Jammoa picks up half of a turkey sandwich and takes a huge bite.

00:11:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Something about penises."

00:11:33 Ather Jammoa asks, "Who wrote it?"

00:11:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Penises are a remarkable subject of discussion."

00:11:54 Vernos Bailey says, "I just trashed it. I did not care."

00:12:06 Ather Jammoa says, "When...well, not usually, but well."

00:12:13 Ather Jammoa takes another large bite of a turkey sandwich.

00:12:26 Morris Corlew says, "Lily said somethin about phrasin something grammatically incorrect earlier. Maybe her."

00:12:27 Morris Corlew shrugs.

00:12:54 Vernos Bailey shrugs.

00:13:03 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

00:13:18 Vernos Bailey says, "It is the rift train."

00:13:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Hoot, hoot."

00:13:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Always fun to be on."

00:13:47 Ather Jammoa finishes off half of a turkey sandwich.

00:14:06 Nissi Valdaire says, "You should listen to Lily, she has explorered an entire world of grammar."

00:14:15 Morris Corlew laughs at Nissi Valdaire.

00:14:19 Vernos says to Melinda, "I almost left the one probe behind earlier."

00:14:36 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

00:14:36 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

00:14:43 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

00:14:46 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

00:14:53 Melinda says to Vernos, "Whoops."

00:14:57 Vernos says to Melinda, "I forgot when it was launched and nearly started the drive three minutes early."

00:14:57 Nissi Valdaire says, "If we find a protostar or something soon we should take it."

00:15:11 Morris Corlew asks, "Take a protostar?"

00:15:18 Melinda Michaels beams.

00:15:18 Ather Jammoa says, "She means charge, man. Charge."

00:15:24 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

00:15:25 Melinda Michaels laughs. "Dear me."

00:15:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "Salvage it up."

00:15:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "The whole thing."

00:15:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

00:15:39 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire. "That's where my mind went."

00:15:40 Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:15:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:16:08 Ather says to Nissi, "Please unfold the 1 trillion unit storage hold."

00:16:14 Nissi Valdaire grins.

00:16:19 Ather Jammoa says, "And then unfold like 20 more."

00:16:25 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

00:16:30 Vernos Bailey says, "A ship literally powered by a star."

00:16:52 Vernos Bailey says, "Brings new meaning to solar powered."

00:17:07 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "We must scooooop the gases in the star, too!"

00:17:20 Ather Jammoa says, "Alas. Our atmospheric scoops would probably explode horifically."

00:17:30 Morris Corlew says, "As would we."

00:17:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Such is liiiife."

00:18:24 Vernos Bailey says, "So what happened to that crew that went down from farport....they all exploded while trying to scoop in a star."

00:18:56 Morris Corlew says, "Except, alas, we have no scoops."

00:19:03 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

00:19:05 Vernos Bailey says, "Which means we are safe."

00:19:14 Morris Corlew says, "Lies."

00:19:34 Morris Corlew says, "Safety is only an illusion."

00:19:36 Vernos Bailey says, "Well we are safe from exploding while scooping in a star this time."

00:19:46 Morris Corlew gives Vernos Bailey a thumbs up! "Specifics."

00:19:47 Morris Corlew grins.

00:19:51 Ather Jammoa says, "It is too bad that we likely can't use the hydrogen canisters for recharging."

00:20:07 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, that's pretty pure hydrogen."

00:20:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Know what I would like to see come out of the mind of fienstein next."

00:20:31 Ather Jammoa starts in on the second half of a turkey sandwich.

00:20:42 Morris Corlew asks, "Wrappers that you can't tell a person's handwriting?"

00:20:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, that was already available, once."

00:21:11 Ather Jammoa says, "I won't go into too much detail, but it was once possible."

00:21:13 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

00:21:25 Ather Jammoa says, "And no, it wasn't before the war."

00:21:26 Ather Jammoa chortles.

00:21:34 Vernos Bailey says, "I was referring to an actual method of diving into a star to recharge."

00:21:43 Morris Corlew says, "Ouch."

00:22:00 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

00:22:04 Ather Jammoa asks, "Have we actually tried to descend into one of the gas giants around here to check their tritium levels?"

00:22:04 Lily Kaise glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

00:22:10 Lily Kaise blinks slowly, her thoughts turning inward.

00:22:19 Lily Kaise says, "Right Vernos."

00:22:25 Vernos Bailey says, "No we have not."

00:22:32 Vernos says to Lily, "Too far out there?"

00:22:50 Ather says to Nissi, "Can we try to descend into a gas giant's atmosphere on our next stop to see if we can determine tritium levels?"

00:23:02 Ather Jammoa takes another large bite of a turkey sandwich.

00:23:13 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

00:23:55 Ather Jammoa finishes off the last of a turkey sandwich.

00:24:03 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "I guess!"

00:24:11 Ather Jammoa puts down a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

00:24:17 Ather Jammoa beams at Nissi Valdaire.

00:24:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:25:22 Vernos Bailey laughs.

00:25:26 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

00:31:35 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

00:31:37 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:32:45 Morris Corlew pokes and prods at a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

00:33:39 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

00:33:58 Morris Corlew says, "I may not have a ticket, but we have a rude wrapper."

00:34:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Urmom is a rude wrapper."

00:35:13 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

00:35:23 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

00:37:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

00:37:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo people of the ship."

00:37:20 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

00:37:26 You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

00:37:30 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Howdy."

00:37:42 Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Allo!"

00:37:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Quite the so, quite the so."

00:38:02 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "What do you smell?"

00:38:02 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "I have honored you with glorious message once more. Please express level of grand offense."

00:38:08 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:38:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Could our amazing streak of stars be at an end?"

00:38:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec absently sniffs at the air.

00:38:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sniffs at himself.

00:38:16 Ather Jammoa points at a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

00:38:20 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, if you insist."

00:38:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a squid-shaped can of air freshener from a small black leather backpack.

00:38:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sprays a bit of a squid-shaped can of air freshener into the air, and the scent of squid permeates the area.

00:38:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo."

00:38:30 Morris Corlew says, "Oh god..."

00:38:31 Lily ducks.

00:38:31 Morris Corlew says, "Ick."

00:38:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a squid-shaped can of air freshener in a small cloth sack.

00:38:35 Morris Corlew removes a can of rain-scented air freshener from a forest green backpack.

00:38:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "You insisted."

00:38:37 Morris Corlew sprays a bit of a can of rain-scented air freshener into the air, and the scent of a warm summer rain permeates the area.

00:38:40 Morris Corlew absently sniffs at the air.

00:38:44 Morris Corlew puts a can of rain-scented air freshener in a forest green backpack.

00:38:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Message, you are saying?"

00:38:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Let us see."

00:38:52 Lily Kaise removes a can of maple syrup air freshener from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

00:38:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:39:00 Lily Kaise puts a can of maple syrup air freshener in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

00:39:03 Lily Kaise removes a can of rain-scented air freshener from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

00:39:08 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:39:23 Morris Corlew says, "I made the mistake of sprayin that squid stuff in my capsule on a fairly lengthy trip once."

00:39:24 Morris Corlew shudders.

00:39:26 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:39:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Message on QE?"

00:39:30 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh yeah good smell preference Morris!"

00:39:40 Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:39:40 Lily Kaise puts a can of rain-scented air freshener in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

00:39:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:39:48 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "The wrapper."

00:39:49 Morris Corlew points at a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

00:39:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Oh, okay."

00:40:04 Vernos Bailey absently sniffs at the air.

00:40:17 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:40:18 Lily Kaise glides south.

00:40:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, let us classify vital dispatch in file cabinet of vital dispatch."

00:40:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec picks up a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

00:40:42 Morris Corlew says, "I was curious if the squid stuff really smelled like squid, or if it smelled like sea air and just was shaped like squid."

00:40:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

00:40:54 Morris Corlew says, "So I had to sit there smelling squid for over 4 hours."

00:41:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "There, it has been archived for generations of futuring."

00:41:10 Morris Corlew laughs.

00:41:12 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "You are glorious butt."

00:42:11 Pierre-Louis says to Ather, "You should put head right now into special archive file cabinet for benefits of generations of future."

00:42:31 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

00:42:34 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

00:42:38 Lily Kaise glides east.

00:42:50 Morris says to Ather, "Science."

00:42:52 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

00:42:54 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "The future would not be able to comprehend my vast superiority. I better keep them safe and just remain a constant so that they can just get use to it."

00:43:03 I don't see that here.

00:43:06 I don't see that here.

00:43:08 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

00:43:14 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:43:19 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:43:20 Morris says to Ather, "We can't comprehend your vast insuperiority-I mean superior-."

00:43:21 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

00:43:22 Morris Corlew laughs.

00:43:25 Morris Corlew says, "Can't even say it."

00:43:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yes, well."

00:43:28 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:43:30 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

00:43:32 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:44:11 Ather says to Morris, "See? Yo uare so inferior that you used a word which is not even a word."

00:44:35 Ather Jammoa pats Morris Corlew on the back. "There there."

00:44:45 Ather Jammoa says, "You just need a few parts upgraded."

00:44:49 Morris says to Ather, "I was laughin too hard."

00:45:02 Morris says to Ather, "No thanks. I'm perfectly happy with my full humanity."

00:45:22 Lily Kaise grins.

00:45:29 You grin.

00:45:33 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Sure, sure. Use laughter to justify yourself. It always works with the uninformed!"

00:45:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:47:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

00:49:07 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

01:05:14 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

01:05:21 Morris Corlew shivers.

01:07:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:13:45 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:16:00 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

01:26:35 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

01:29:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:36:14 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

01:36:24 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

01:39:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:41:46 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:45:46 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

01:50:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:51:46 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

01:52:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We must find more stars."

01:53:05 Lily Kaise gently caresses your neck and shoulders.

01:53:41 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:54:14 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Well, if someone hits your head hard enough, you will definitely see all of the stars you want to see. Incidentally, I volunteer to help you see those grand stars. It will be a great sacrifice of time, and effort on my part, but I will do what I must to make you happy, grand comrade."

01:54:15 Ather Jammoa pats Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec on the back.

01:54:24 Lily Kaise chuckles.

01:54:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ow wow!"

01:54:37 You chuckle.

01:54:51 Morris Corlew says, "An amazing opportunity he will surely want to forego."

01:54:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We'll hear somebody's bell ringing for sure!"

01:54:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:54:59 You chuckle.

01:55:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Ding dong."

02:01:26 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

02:01:35 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

02:01:39 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

02:01:42 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters into the room.

02:01:46 Magellan the arachnoid security robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks.

02:01:50 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters south.

02:01:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:02:01 Vernos Bailey says, "Just got to stretch the legs every so often."

02:02:09 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

02:06:15 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

02:10:51 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

02:10:52 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

02:11:18 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

02:11:23 Morris Corlew begins browsing through a small black leather portfolio.

02:11:23 Vernos Bailey carefully unwraps a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

02:11:38 Vernos Bailey picks up half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and takes a huge bite.

02:11:57 A black digital felo game beeps plaintively for food.

02:12:25 Vernos Bailey takes another large bite of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

02:12:42 Morris Corlew pulls out a sheet of blue stationery with a border of grinning skulls and reads it.

02:13:07 Vernos Bailey asks, "How many jacob smitts are there?"

02:13:08 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:13:16 Lily Kaise says, "Just one that I know of."

02:13:20 Morris Corlew glances at a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator.

02:13:23 Vernos Bailey pokes and prods at a red metachannel FTL communicator.

02:13:27 Morris Corlew shakes his head and shrugs helplessly.

02:13:40 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:13:52 Vernos Bailey finishes off half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

02:14:10 Lily Kaise says, "What in the stars is that dude doing back there."

02:14:16 Morris Corlew says, "Who knows."

02:14:31 Vernos Bailey starts in on the second half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

02:14:34 Vernos Bailey takes another large bite of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

02:14:35 Vernos Bailey finishes off the last of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

02:14:41 Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

02:14:42 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

02:14:52 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

02:14:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:15:04 Vernos Bailey puts down a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

02:15:17 Morris Corlew asks, "Art?"

02:15:19 Vernos Bailey smirks.

02:15:41 Vernos Bailey says, "Well I had to write on it."

02:15:50 Lily Kaise pokes and prods at a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

02:15:51 Vernos Bailey asks, "Is that not some form of art?"

02:15:57 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

02:15:58 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:16:05 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Planets!"

02:16:07 Vernos Bailey says, "Morris."

02:16:09 Vernos Bailey says, "Take us in."

02:16:09 Jason Rat says, "Wo."

02:16:12 Morris Corlew laughs.

02:16:15 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:16:15 A readout shows Planetary System 8769-5473 about 4.68 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Up.

02:16:17 Morris says to Vernos, "Captain vernos?"

02:16:20 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:16:23 Vernos Bailey picks up a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

02:16:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Nah."

02:16:34 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Wow just frantasically fabulous! Amazing!"

02:16:36 Morris Corlew asks, "Anybody wanna do it?"

02:16:39 Vernos Bailey says, "Just practicing for when I sam."

02:16:42 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

02:16:46 Vernos Bailey says, "Am."

02:16:48 Morris says to Vernos, "Ok Sam."

02:17:00 Vernos says to Morris, "I meant am, you jerk."

02:17:02 Vernos Bailey smirks.

02:17:04 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Lily. Care to do an approach?"

02:17:05 Morris Corlew grins at Vernos Bailey.

02:17:13 Morris says to Jason, "Or you?"

02:17:14 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

02:17:17 Vernos Bailey gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:17:19 Ather Jammoa asks, "Will someone do the approach already!?"

02:17:21 Damien Goss sits down.

02:17:22 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:17:23 Lily Kaise says, "I've done plenty of approaches in my pa naa I've done a lot in my day so would rather you all who have less experience."

02:17:27 Morris Corlew lopes south.

02:17:36 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that."

02:17:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:17:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:17:46 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

02:17:53 Vernos Bailey says, "I created more wrapper art."

02:18:01 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

02:18:01 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

02:18:03 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I will be happy to probe it though so I can do that one time before I take Dove out for a spin."

02:18:13 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

02:18:14 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

02:18:15 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

02:18:28 You begin dry heaving.

02:19:01 The stage lights flicker briefly.

02:19:46 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:20:01 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

02:20:03 Vernos Bailey says, "We passed it trying to decide on who was taking us in."

02:20:09 Vernos Bailey snickers.

02:21:28 Ather hmphs.

02:21:47 Vernos Bailey says, "I am sure this is being corrected."

02:21:57 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I was pressing too many buttons and tried to say that I've done plenty of approaches in my day and I am happy that you all with less experience are getting the opportunity to perform them so I will pass but thanks for asking."

02:22:21 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm watchin the master."

02:22:36 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Woo she truly is and I learned a lot from Nissi."

02:22:42 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:22:43 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:24:02 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

02:24:13 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's ok morris, I'll leave."

02:24:23 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Nah, I can watch from down here."

02:25:29 Vernos Bailey says, "I had wrote my latest wrapper lettter in peanut butter and jelly."

02:25:29 An orange digital felo game beeps plaintively for food.

02:25:37 Morris Corlew raises an eyebrow at Vernos Bailey.

02:25:58 You begin dry heaving.

02:25:58 You hear a wet tearing sound.

02:26:28 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh my attempt at being funny, fails again."

02:26:38 Vernos says to Ather, "It would seem I need help being funny."

02:26:41 Morris Corlew says, "I guess I just don't get what's so funny bout it."

02:26:58 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

02:27:27 Vernos says to Morris, "Eh no worries. I think I will just stick to the five levels of lordy."

02:27:39 Morris Corlew grins and nods to Vernos Bailey.

02:28:00 Vernos Bailey says, "Although I am trying to write a sixth level."

02:28:02 Morris says to Vernos, "It's not just yours I don't get...it's the whole thing of givin folks your trash, especially with cruel or rude stuff written on it."

02:28:41 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh I don't do cruel or rude."

02:29:07 Vernos Bailey says, "It just failed to be as funny as hoped."

02:29:14 Morris Corlew nods.

02:29:28 Damien Goss says, "You may not have meant to be cruel or rude, but different people are different and take things differently."

02:29:32 Morris Corlew says, "None of 'em were to me, but...I dunno...some folks found 'em funny, so I can't judge."

02:29:39 Damien Goss says, "For example."

02:29:54 Damien Goss says, "Morris there sent a box of soap to someone once."

02:30:02 Morris Corlew nods. "Was a random gift."

02:30:05 Damien Goss says, "Some thought it was funny, some insulting."

02:30:11 Vernos Bailey says, "Morris, you smell."

02:30:14 Morris Corlew nods. "Sure wasn't meant to be."

02:30:17 Morris Corlew absently sniffs at the air.

02:30:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Here is some soap."

02:30:22 Vernos Bailey smirks.

02:30:25 Ather Jammoa says, "The only useful thigns Morris ever sent to me were credits, and crafting components."

02:30:27 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

02:30:27 Morris says to Vernos, "Nah, had nothin to do with that."

02:30:32 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

02:30:32 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a classic system of mixed rocky and gas planets, much like the systems where all of humanity's colonies can be found.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:30:37 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

02:30:41 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

02:30:45 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

02:30:49 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, it will be another 5-7 planets."

02:30:52 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

02:30:56 Damien Goss gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:30:56 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on extended observation."

02:30:57 Damien Goss scrambles to his feet.
Damien Goss steps south.

02:30:58 Vernos Bailey says into the PA microphone, "The captain has led us all to victory and glorious planets."

02:30:59 Aisling the Fox says, "Exciting."

02:31:00 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

02:31:05 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

02:31:13 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "She sure has!"

02:31:29 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

02:31:29 Ather Jammoa strides south.

02:31:31 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:31:35 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "And roid."

02:31:40 Vernos Bailey says into the PA microphone, "Control room party."

02:31:44 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:31:56 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

02:32:17 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Saw grade 70 debris so probably 60-80 or 70-90."

02:32:29 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Or 50 to 70."

02:32:36 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep could be."

02:32:52 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just 1 chunk in this sector so."

02:34:18 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Lumins are very bright."

02:34:26 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Nice."

02:34:29 An orange digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

02:34:47 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Everyone start shoveling!"

02:34:50 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nissi says get to shovelling."

02:34:53 The blast chamber begins warming up.

02:34:55 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:34:56 Morris Corlew lopes south.

02:35:45 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

02:35:46 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:36:46 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

02:39:34 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

02:39:37 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

02:40:05 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No one was in control, did we get the distance calculations?"

02:40:18 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Or anything you want done up here?"

02:40:26 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't worry about all that. We'll be here for so long we can recalculate lal that."

02:40:35 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

02:40:45 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

02:42:36 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "37.79% wear on furnace."

02:43:46 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:45:45 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

02:46:51 The blast chamber shuts down, having enough fuel to fully recharge the starship.

02:47:08 [MTTS] babyboy: Questioin, is round time a thing we could use in game? It seem like a ooc thing, just wondering.

02:47:29 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey not bad, 3 hours to charge up."

02:47:34 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

02:47:35 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:47:39 [MTTS] Carroll: Yes its ooc I do believe.

02:47:57 [MTTS] babyboy: Oh heh, so many people use it, I never respond to it, thanks.

02:48:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Kind of depends on what it is I think.

02:48:29 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

02:48:30 Aisling the Fox prances south.

02:48:30 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:48:32 [MTTS] usfolks: If you're crafting, salvaging, or something else where your hands are busy, you can't do much else.

02:48:55 [MTTS] babyboy: I guess you could say give me 30 seconds, tieing this off.

02:49:18 [MTTS] babyboy: For asteroids. But this is good to know.

02:49:31 [MTTS] usfolks: That's pretty much how I handle it. Or if I can't reply right away because I'm on salvaging roundtime or an asteroid, just leave it at 'couldn't reach my comm.'

02:49:46 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:50:09 [MTTS] muhala: You could also just be vague and say you were busy, or give me a moment/minute/little bit.

02:50:40 Anfisa the Wanderer presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

02:51:24 [MTTS] usfolks: I have to admit that ic references to "roundtime" bug me a bit, but I'm not going to comment on it if someone does it. I've seen people who have played this game for many years reference roundtime. So I certainly can't call someone out on it.

02:51:41 You hear a loud clang, followed by a distinct thud: the sound of a ship docking.

02:51:46 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:52:18 [MTTS] atherj: It's more along the lines of referred to as a time of recovery of sorts. Like, when you've set your weapons to fire, it takes a few seconds for the computer to calculate, the weapons to get the necessary energy gathered etc. Kind of same for battlesuit weapons and the like.

02:52:25 [MTTS] kaite: It's human to forget that it's actually a wait time but we naturally want to quantify it and make horrible mistakes in character.

02:53:01 [MTTS] usfolks: Of course. We're humans and not professionals.

02:53:10 [MTTS] Squidmind: Don't worry, it irritates us too.

02:53:17 [MTTS] babyboy: 3 cheers for that, hehe.

02:53:22 [MTTS] kaite: Oh I'm sure we do!

02:53:28 [MTTS] kaite: Laugh.

02:53:36 [MTTS] kaite: Oops like that one.

02:58:29 Eli Grey presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:59:34 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

02:59:37 Eli Grey roams south.

02:59:46 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:05:21 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

03:24:51 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:24:54 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:26:06 You hear a low scraping sound as the ship undocks.

03:26:27 You hear an odd rumbling sound as the large docking bay door opens.

03:26:32 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

03:27:47 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:28:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How many?"

03:28:22 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

03:28:25 The starship is not in the riftflow.

03:28:27 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 8769-5473 I on close approach."

03:28:32 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

03:28:37 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 8769-5473 I on extended observation."

03:28:44 I don't see that here.

03:29:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:29:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:29:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:29:58 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Nice!"

03:30:05 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Awesomely nice."

03:30:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:30:17 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Come up here if you wanna see the green planets, jumping there next."

03:30:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:30:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:30:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:30:26 You scramble to your feet.

Nissi Valdaire, Vernos Bailey, Aisling the Fox, Lily Kaise, Eli Grey, Ather Jammoa, and Morris Corlew are standing here.
You can go southeast, southwest, up, and out.

03:30:32 Nissi Valdaire presses a series of buttons on a small probe control board.

03:30:32 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

03:30:35 Jason Rat jogs in from the southeast.

03:30:36 Lily Kaise activates the long-range salvage sensor and begins scanning for chunks of debris.

03:30:37 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 8769-5473 V on close approach."

03:30:38 Vernos says to Ather, "Do not forget you wanted to check the tritum levels."

03:30:39 The salvage sensor reports detection of a small comet (grade 90) at a range of 36000km at Sector Northwest and Down.

03:30:43 Nissi Valdaire presses a series of buttons on a small probe control board.

05:56:24 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:56:34 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:56:34 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:40:45 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:41:18 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Game will be played after repairs."

06:41:42 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anybody else coming out?"

06:49:09 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The game of horrible people can now actually be played."

06:49:13 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:49:23 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:49:23 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:49:33 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

11:50:45 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:51:03 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:51:03 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:52:03 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

11:54:34 Automatic daily maintenance is complete.

11:56:19 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Somebody getting these planets?"

11:56:29 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sarah and I are approaching."

11:56:34 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, hopefully planets."

11:56:39 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I can push the buttons, too! But I don~C3~A6t know which ones."

11:57:47 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah I'm not sure how to do what when we get there. I know how to launch a p robe but that's it."

11:58:06 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

11:58:10 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:58:10 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

11:58:26 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:58:38 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

11:58:47 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:59:11 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:59:15 Lily Kaise kisses you.

11:59:22 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

11:59:26 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

11:59:40 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of soft dark pink slippers onto her feet.

11:59:46 Lily Kaise glides east.

12:00:10 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

12:00:53 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

12:01:03 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

12:04:18 You venture through a side door.

12:04:18 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

12:05:18 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

12:06:01 You venture through a side door.

12:06:01 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

12:07:18 You venture through a side door.

12:07:29 You venture through a side door.

12:07:40 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

12:07:42 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

12:07:42 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:10:04 [MTTS] kaite: Odd that this planetary system indicates Discoverers none'

12:11:16 [MTTS] autumnrain: That is truly odd.

12:12:06 [MTTS] alc_71: You might want to send in a ticket.

12:13:13 [MTTS] kaite: Ok it is valid while in the Control Room but wasn't in the Observation Deck. Will go look again and send a ticket if applicable.

12:13:20 [MTTS] autumnrain: Should we all send in a ticket?

12:13:36 [MTTS] autumnrain: Never mind, it shows up now.

12:17:03 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

12:17:07 Lily Kaise removes a brightly colored poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Isis from a camera bag.

12:17:14 Lily Kaise puts a brightly colored poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Isis in a camera bag.

12:17:17 Lily Kaise closes a camera bag.

12:17:24 Lily Kaise glides east.

12:25:52 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

12:31:29 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

12:31:39 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:31:49 The starship has left a unique area of space.

12:31:49 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

12:36:57 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

13:01:40 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

13:06:32 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

13:12:04 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

13:22:20 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

13:32:28 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

13:32:38 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

14:02:20 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

14:12:50 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

14:23:24 A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.

14:31:34 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

14:34:19 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

14:34:29 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

14:48:28 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:00:48 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:10:56 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

15:11:56 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:20:46 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:29:26 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:35:56 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

15:36:06 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

15:43:51 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:05:57 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

16:13:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

16:15:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:16:18 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

16:17:17 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:25:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:27:59 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

16:28:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

16:37:23 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

16:37:34 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

16:50:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

16:51:19 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

16:59:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:07:24 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

17:09:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

17:17:41 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

17:24:52 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

17:35:30 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

17:39:04 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

17:39:13 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

18:09:04 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

18:14:53 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

18:25:14 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

18:35:31 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

18:39:17 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

18:39:27 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

19:09:18 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

19:19:58 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

19:30:31 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

19:40:34 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

19:40:44 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

19:53:34 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

20:10:35 Several snowglobes stacked vertically hover past at high speed.

20:21:00 A hovercar spends several minutes overtaking you. Smooth, cycloptic faces peer out its windows at you.

20:28:08 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

20:38:36 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

20:41:00 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

20:41:10 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

21:02:19 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

21:12:27 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

21:22:47 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

21:23:15 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:23:47 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

21:24:02 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:27:55 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:27:55 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

21:28:15 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:28:50 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:28:55 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

21:28:56 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:29:16 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:29:16 The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

21:46:27 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:46:37 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:46:37 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:46:38 The starship has left a unique area of space.

21:46:47 Listen. You need to be careful.

22:16:39 You should keep your room locked while you sleep.

22:29:37 Lily Kaise (asleep)

22:29:37 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 
22:29:37 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

22:29:38 Morris Corlew waves to you.

22:30:24 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

22:31:57 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:33:00 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

22:33:44 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

22:33:45 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

22:33:57 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:35:53 Vernos Bailey says, "I keep dozing in and out, might not be best for me to recount what I know."

22:36:01 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

22:36:01 Morris says to Vernos, "I got it."

22:36:03 Vernos Bailey says, "I think I need a nap or something."

22:36:09 Morris Corlew nods.

22:36:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Maybe more coffee."

22:36:39 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

22:37:26 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

22:37:45 You're not imagining it. This is real.

22:37:53 Morris nods slowly.

22:38:36 Vernos Bailey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

22:38:40 Vernos Bailey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and a layer of gravel on the floor creates a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the center is guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon green plastic plant waves around, anchored into the gravel. A large goldfish and several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yello
