Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair
of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, a pair of sparkly white leather clogs,
and a pair of light brown leather boots decorated with silver stars here.
