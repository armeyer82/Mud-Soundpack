Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of
the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.
[PA] Sarah Bellamy: "Night Bob."
The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the
landscape below.
The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries
swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
Listen. You need to be careful.
[PA] Sarah Bellamy: "Night Vern."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Vern, just snore back and wake him up."
[PA] Vernos Bailey: "Rest well when you all decide to search for it."
You're not imagining it. This is real.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Rest well Cheri."
You're really alone here. So very alone.
Is it really worth it? This?
Remember what I said.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly
creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with
gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.
Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like
thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

from beneath the conveyor belt, making the air shimmer with heat.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked

existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every

A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.
The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly
creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with
gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.
The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air
before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you

it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other,
then places it back on the conveyor belt.
Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along
with yours.
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
Listen. You need to be careful.
There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that you are a failure.
You're really alone here. So very alone.
You're really alone here. So very alone.
Remember what I said.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.
The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.
The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later,
it emerges again and all is back to normal.
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
[MTTS] blindbat84: That awkward moment you knock on a ship just before it
lands...
[MTTS] something: Entering it before it lands is more awkward.
[MTTS] Squidmind: I suggest not entering a ship until it lands then.
[MTTS] something: It was an accedent at the time.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "10.28."

[PA] Morris Corlew: "Anyone else comin for outside?"
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Steppin out."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.
A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock
rifle slung over his shoulder.
The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.
Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.
You're not imagining it. This is real.
They talk about you when you are asleep, you know.
Remember what I said.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
