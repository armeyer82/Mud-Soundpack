[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing amethyst and red aqua
tic life and coral rocks, a red plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler, a small white trash bin, and Daizey the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

20:11:31 You see a row of flightlockers, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, an early warning space defense device, a personal hoverpallet, a sturdy cage labeled 'Asteria', and a bulky silver-colored posterizer here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:11:32 You can't go that way.

20:11:33 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Airlock]

20:11:34 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and unpowered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:13:43 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Oh already talking about today's first op?"

20:13:45 Kim Saunders glances down at her expensive silver watch with diamond accents momentarily.

20:13:48 Morris says to Kim, "Nah. Second."

20:13:55 Evenia Callseah hugs you.

20:13:59 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I just remembered that I have some obligations in a couple days. So, I need to clear out soon."

20:18:09 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

20:18:09 Melinda Michaels strolls down.

20:18:19 [League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Control Room]

20:18:19 This is the rather cramped hub of the space station. A starmap, coordinate rundown display, and a few basic station controls are present. There's also a sofa!
You see a beige sofa, a metal table, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.
Nissi Valdaire and Emily Ford are sleeping on a beige sofa.
Kim Saunders and Evenia Callseah are sitting on a beige sofa. Vernos Bailey is standing here.
You can go down.

20:18:29 Melinda Michaels strolls in from below.

20:18:30 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:18:35 Melinda Michaels gives Maggie the obese indigo feathered felo to Evenia Callseah.

20:18:55 Evenia says to Melinda Michaels, "I'll put her with mine. She'll be safe and cared for."

20:19:17 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yea."

20:19:30 Vernos Bailey strolls down.

20:19:36 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "And it goes without saying that Zeus will be fine."

20:19:47 You grin.

20:19:54 Via general sector communication, Full Dive transmits a text-based transmission: "I'm salvaging. there's something wrong with me"

20:19:59 Via general sector communication, Full Dive transmits a text-based transmission: "help"

20:20:03 Evenia Callseah presses some buttons on the communication board.

20:20:03 To all ships in the sector, this station transmits: "we've known that for a long time."

20:20:17 Via general sector communication, Full Dive transmits a text-based transmission: "I'm crying."

20:20:20 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Full Dive" has docked with League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.

20:20:24 Kim Saunders glances at the coordinate rundown.

20:20:28 Evenia Callseah laughs.

20:20:36 Evenia Callseah strokes the soft feathers of Maggie the obese indigo feathered felo.

20:20:36 Maggie the obese indigo feathered felo purrs softly.

20:20:51 Evenia says to Maggie the obese indigo feathered felo in an Ars Magnan accent, "C'mere you, come meet your new friends."

20:20:54 Evenia Callseah stands up from a beige sofa.

20:20:56 Evenia Callseah tramps down.

20:21:00 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Full Dive" has launched from League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.

20:21:08 Evenia Callseah tramps in from below.

20:21:10 Evenia Callseah sits down on a beige sofa.

20:21:17 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

20:21:38 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

20:21:41 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I should be worried for her. I put her down and the first thing she does, is cuddle up to wigglebutt."

20:21:47 Ali Candan strides in from below.

20:21:57 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Woo Kim hello Kim how are you Kim."

20:22:01 Kim Saunders grins.

20:22:03 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hi."

20:22:11 Ali Candan sits down on a beige sofa.

20:22:26 Ali says to Kim, "Thanks for killing my enthusiasm!"

20:22:33 Evenia grins at Ali and opens her mouth to speak.

20:22:37 Kim says to Ali, "Oh, what'd I do?"

20:22:43 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Killed my enthusiasm."

20:22:47 Vernos Bailey strolls in from below.

20:22:49 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Oh?"

20:22:54 Evenia Callseah laughs. "That was me."

20:23:00 Ali says to Evenia, "No. Not you."

20:23:03 Morris Corlew lopes in from below.

20:23:05 You chuckle.

20:23:08 Morris Corlew sits down on a beige sofa.

20:23:09 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "I didn't do, anything?"

20:23:10 Ali says to Morris Corlew, "Kim killed my enthusiasm."

20:23:12 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Wait, I'm actually innocent for once?"

20:23:19 Morris Corlew gives Kim Saunders a thumbs up!

20:23:19 Vernos Bailey says to Evenia, "Never."

20:23:21 You say to Evenia, "You are never innocent."

20:23:27 Evenia Callseah laughs.

20:23:36 Morris says to Kim, "Nice work. Always knew ya had it in ya."

20:23:48 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Typical, the 2 AEU guys gang up against me."

20:23:51 Evenia Callseah grins.

20:23:54 You laugh.

20:23:56 You hug Evenia Callseah.

20:24:02 You say to Evenia, "But I give you hugs."

20:24:09 Evenia Callseah hugs you.

20:24:12 Vernos Bailey says to Evenia, "And I stroke the hawk."

20:24:12 Morris says to you in an Appalachian accent, "Give her crap instead. More fun."

20:24:18 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "That's true, so I'll let it slide."

20:24:18 You chuckle at Morris Corlew.

20:24:32 Morris Corlew puts a secondary pilot command access unit in a slate blue leather gear bag.

20:24:34 Evenia says to Vernos Bailey, "Only because I let you. The hawk is a very special thing."

20:24:51 Ali Candan asks in a Turkish accent, "Who's hawk?"

20:24:56 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Mine."

20:24:57 You say, "Eve's."

20:24:58 Morris says to Evenia, "Not as tempting as the curls, so it works."

20:25:02 Evenia bobs her head toward Ali.

20:25:23 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "You are talking to the guy with pink hair."

20:25:28 Evenia Callseah grins at Morris Corlew. "Those curls got sooo heavy."

20:25:43 Ali Candan glances at the coordinate rundown.

20:25:45 You have gained an accumulated 392,809,634.79 credits, approximately, from temporary space station activities.

20:25:49 Morris says to Evenia, "Yeah, mine's gotten down my back before, those braids with as thick as my hair is? Yep."

20:25:55 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Welp money."

20:26:00 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Sanity."

20:26:06 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Mmhmm. 740 mill almost."

20:26:10 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Woo, 300 million mark."

20:26:15 Morris Corlew gives Vernos Bailey a thumbs up!

20:26:22 Evenia Callseah cheers for Vernos Bailey!

20:26:29 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I would love to hit half a bil before we leave."

20:26:33 You grin.

20:26:36 Evenia Callseah gives Vernos Bailey some credits.

20:26:42 Evenia says to Vernos, "Just to help it along."

20:26:44 Evenia Callseah giggles.

20:26:45 Morris Corlew gives Vernos Bailey some credits.

20:26:52 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Fuck no one helps me."

20:26:58 Morris Corlew gives Ali Candan some credits.

20:27:14 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Though to be honest Lily helped me a lot once. She's a heroine."

20:27:32 Morris says to Ali, "Is that so?"

20:27:52 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "It does help."

20:28:01 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I just got seven credits closer."

20:28:10 Morris says to Evenia, "Cheepskate."

20:28:34 Evenia Callseah grins at Morris Corlew. "Hey, technically I helped him."

20:28:50 Morris says to Evenia, "Yep."

20:29:03 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Huh. How much is a burger at Chet's?"

20:29:03 Evenia Callseah finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

20:29:09 Evenia Callseah puts a cup in a small natural golden brown trash bin.

20:29:30 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:29:31 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "More than 7 credits."

20:29:33 Evenia Callseah laughs.

20:29:40 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Ah."

20:29:46 Morris Corlew gives Vernos Bailey some credits.

20:30:34 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "The Atocha Star" has suddenly appeared on sensor scans.

20:30:35 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Fifty-sev."

20:30:38 Ali Candan presses some buttons on the communication board.

20:30:38 To all ships in the sector, this station transmits: "gooossss"

20:30:45 Evenia says to Nicolette in an Ars Magnan accent, "Nah, just felt like saying hi by wrinkling my nose at you."

20:30:47 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I miscounted, its fifty-seven."

20:30:47 Via general sector communication, The Atocha Star transmits a text-based transmission: "yes"

20:30:55 Morris Corlew nods.

20:31:11 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Math is difficult. Especially for pilots."

20:31:14 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

20:31:30 Morris says to Nicolette, "Not all pilots."

20:31:34 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Most."

20:31:37 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "I mean 4 hours charge. 10 minute ETA. Totally time to power down systems. Right?"

20:31:38 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:31:39 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Math is love."

20:31:42 Nicolette Lawrence nods.

20:31:44 Morris Corlew grins at Evenia Callseah.

20:32:02 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Precise math is even more so."

20:32:41 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I will power down weapons systems for my tiny little laser on my capsule so that I don't run out of charge."

22:36:44 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I got one op left to fill I think."

22:36:44 Kim Saunders strides in from below.

22:36:51 Kim Saunders smiles.

22:36:51 You hug Kim Saunders.

22:36:52 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Blue Marlin" has launched from League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station.

22:36:53 Kim Saunders sits down on a beige sofa.

22:36:54 Johann Schraft walks in from below.

22:36:54 You say to Kim, "Hi."

22:36:55 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "Knock on Full dive. I need to rest a little. As I lying down."

22:36:56 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Mine are all done. But I'll help out anyway."

22:37:09 You say, "Mine are done too, but I'm happy to help."

22:37:09 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "If I get in on the last two, that will be 11 of 12 since I have been out here."

22:37:12 Ali Candan strides down.

22:37:12 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Did someone say op?"

22:37:15 Johann Schraft sits down on a beige sofa.

22:37:22 Evenia Callseah hugs Johann Schraft.

22:37:23 Kim Saunders glances at the coordinate rundown.

22:37:24 Johann Schraft hugs Evenia Callseah.

22:37:27 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Another?"

22:37:27 Evenia says to Johann, "We just finished one."

22:37:30 Kim Saunders presses some buttons on the communication board.

22:37:30 To all ships in the sector, this station transmits: "Hi there Blue Marlin."

22:37:30 Johann Schraft grins.

22:37:31 Bryan Stout laughs.

22:37:34 Via general sector communication, Blue Marlin transmits a text-based transmission: "Hi"

22:37:39 Melinda says to Johann, "So those omega's like to repair at 90%, those are the ones we lost this go around."

22:37:46 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yeah they do."

22:37:50 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

22:37:58 Morris Corlew lopes in from below.

22:38:01 Morris Corlew sits down on a beige sofa.

22:38:02 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh that I didn't know."

22:38:03 Melinda says to Evenia in a Bedford accent, "Oh, did you do clean up?"

22:38:03 You wave to Morris Corlew.

22:38:08 Morris Corlew waves.

22:38:15 Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "I did. It's all sorted."

22:38:25 Melinda says to Bryan, "Yeah they do but still hafta try to get them to leave."

22:38:25 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "They're a pain, but if you get their average damage to 80, they decide to give up eventually."

22:38:30 Bryan Stout nods.

22:38:32 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:38:32 Melinda says to Evenia in a Bedford accent, "Thanks."

22:38:45 Morris says to Johann, "Not always."

22:38:46 Morris Corlew sighs.

22:38:50 "Of course." Evenia Callseah smiles at Melinda Michaels. "You've all had to do that enough. I don't mind."

22:39:00 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

22:39:43 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I hate to sound callus, but it's not our fault. Hell half the time if they're still shooting at it I wonder hwy we go to such lengths if they don't seem to care."

22:39:50 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I'm low onn chaingun resists now though. So I'll have to gun on the next ones if I defend."

22:39:53 You nod to Johann Schraft.

22:39:57 You remove a chaingun resistance boost from a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

22:40:01 You give a chaingun resistance boost to Evenia Callseah.

22:40:04 You say to Evenia, "There."

22:40:15 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Correction, I am not low on chaingun resists."

22:40:19 Bryan says to Johann, "I'm kind of with you on that. I was throwing out general sector on a single guerilla at 90 last time and it just wouldn't go. Telling it to get the fuck out."

22:40:23 Evenia Callseah opens a gold-toned engineering tool case for a moment.

22:40:23 Evenia Callseah puts a chaingun resistance boost in a gold-toned engineering tool case.

22:40:29 Rogue says to Evenia in a Ticulian accent, "Which is why I been gunnin' the whole time here."

22:40:45 Nicolette Lawrence stomps in from below.

22:40:46 Nicolette Lawrence sits down on a beige sofa.

22:40:51 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I need to find more blueprints."

22:40:54 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

22:40:58 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "One of these years."

22:41:01 Evenia says to Rogue, "Eng is where I'm most comfortable, that's why I often do it."

22:41:04 Rogue Romano waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

22:41:08 Nicolette Lawrence waves and waves.

22:41:14 You wave to Nicolette Lawrence.

22:41:19 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I mean, I'm not saying just the hell with it just shoot them all, but we seem to care more about their lives than they do."

22:41:20 Rogue says to Evenia in a Ticulian accent, "I rather shoot 'em."

22:41:28 "Thanks." Evenia Callseah grins at you. "I'm totally out of threads, so can't make any resists at all."

22:41:28 You say to Evenia, "What are your colors?"

22:41:30 Bryan Stout nods to Johann Schraft.

22:41:48 Evenia says to you in an Ars Magnan accent, "Blue and yellow."

22:42:05 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I guess for me...personally...doesn't matter if you don't want your life, I don't wanna be the one to take it. Maybe I'm weird, I dunno."

22:42:05 You nod to Evenia Callseah. "We should go to GMG some time."

22:42:15 Evenia Callseah nods to you. "Sure."

22:43:15 Kim says to Morris, "Well, most of us are not excited about destroying those ships and killing the crew. We don't enjoy it, and if there was one sure way we could make them go without blowing up, I am sure we would use it."

22:43:24 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "If my life were on the line it'd be one thing...but it's not."

22:43:28 You nod to Kim Saunders.

22:43:32 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I look at it this way. We do our utmost to save their lives. If they die, we at least know we did everything we could. I'm not saying to hell with it, shoot 'em down. But I'm saying that they have the chance to get out. They can avoid death if they choose to."

22:43:41 Morris says to Kim in an Appalachian accent, "I know. Just...the thought that if they don't care why should we kinda bothers me personally."

22:43:50 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:43:50 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah. "Exactly."

22:43:55 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

22:43:59 Kim says to Morris, "I do not think that way, and I don't know who does."

22:44:10 Morris says to Kim in an Appalachian accent, "Basically what Johann just said."

22:44:16 Bryan says to Morris, "You're basically putting words into Johanns mouth."

22:44:26 Morris Corlew sighs.

22:44:29 Bryan Stout shrugs.

22:44:30 Morris says to Johann, "Say it again then?"

22:44:38 Kim says to Morris, "I do believe Ather though that they attack and kill each other out here every day, and that if they wanted something from us and could kill us to get it, they would not esitate."

22:44:40 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I don't know Morris. I concede we've never had problems with the pods, but relying on them to keep us safe makes us lazy in battle. That's like saying, "Oh, nothing will happen to me.""

22:44:55 Morris says to Kim in an Appalachian accent, "Sure they do."

22:44:55 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Has anyone been in an interdicted pod?"

22:45:00 Evenia Callseah nods.

22:45:00 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Alko has."

22:45:03 You nod.

22:45:05 You say, "Me too."

22:45:10 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Take a think about that."

22:45:13 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, you are basicly... adrift."

22:45:17 You nod.

22:45:17 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "It's scary as shit."

22:45:26 You say, "It really is."

22:45:29 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "If one thing on that pod failed, just one, you're done."

22:45:32 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Gone."

22:45:37 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."

22:45:38 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Probably killed, kidnapped or worse."

22:45:42 You nod.

22:45:56 "Exactly." Evenia Callseah nods. "That thought crossed my mind way too many times when it happened."

22:46:00 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Okay."

22:46:04 Kim Saunders nods. "They are considered to be 99 percent full proof, but there is that 1 percent."

22:46:16 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yes we have rescue pods and they work."

22:46:27 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But other things could happen."

22:46:30 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "So is it really something we want to rely on out here? It's us or them. We can try and help them, but if they're not going to leave I'm not going to risk a ship blowing up and something happening with that pod."

22:46:31 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "It's good what we've been doing from a humanitarian point of view, but dammit, if you're in battle, you need to always be in mind that this is the real thing."

22:46:49 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Ather has been kidnapped out here not once but twice."

22:46:55 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Oh my fuck what?"

22:46:57 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Whaat."

22:47:02 Evenia Callseah nods.

22:47:05 You nod.

22:47:09 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I had no idea about that."

22:47:19 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Nabbed him right out of the bar at Andy's."

22:47:25 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Jesus."

22:47:30 You nod.

22:47:35 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Yeah, and didn't he get darted and almost cooked?"

22:47:39 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "If I have very little damage, I'd rather back off and let them get away then take a kill shot. Again, this is my thinking. No one has to agree with me. I just...prefer to be responsible for as few deaths as possible. No matter if they're scoundrels or not."

22:47:41 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."

22:48:16 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "As for the unregs, we are all battling that issue, and have been for the entire week. It is good we question our moral compas and do not just say hey, who cares that we kill those people. But we can not get sleepless nights and refuse to defend ourselves because of that."

22:48:25 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I don't want to take lives and do the best I can to prevent it."

22:48:32 Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders.

22:48:36 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "They jump in on us, when we're not bothering them at all, and they generally initiate contact, knowing what might happen to them when they do. I don't just sit there and open up on them, I slow way down, I go slower even than what it's suggested that we do. But no, I'm not just going to sit there."

22:48:39 Morris says to Melinda, "Exactly. And that's all I'm saying."

22:48:39 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "But then if we turn this around. What would they do, if somehow we kidnapped one of theirs? I'm not saying we would, hell no. But I'm saying...Would they hold back and not kill us?"

22:48:50 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh you bet they would."

22:48:57 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Probably depends on the faction."

22:49:12 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Probably."

22:49:58 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I try and look at things from every angle. But in the end. If I can save a life I will. If he refuses to leave. That's on him."

22:50:04 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

22:50:08 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

22:50:10 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Keep in mind."

22:50:15 Johann Schraft nods to Evenia Callseah.

22:50:30 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "How many unregs have we destroyed that were not fighters? You can't say we're not making one hell of an effort."

22:50:32 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:50:41 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "That's all we can do really."

22:50:43 Bryan Stout shrugs.

22:50:45 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Of course we are."

22:50:50 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Well there you go."

22:50:53 Kim says to Morris, "Trying to avoid killing them as best as you can is good. But if you can not do that, and they keep shooting their chainguns and torps at you, then I remember the fact that we did not provoke them, we did not start attacking them, they came to attack us, and steal from us if they get a chance."

22:50:53 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Exactly. We do what we can. We can't do anything else."

22:50:54 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Also keep in mind, piracy has always been a capital offense, even in the days of sailing ships."

22:51:05 Morris says to Bryan, "I didn't say we weren't. I just commented on what Johann said."

22:51:08 Bryan Stout nods to Kim Saunders. "Exactly what I'm trying to say."

22:51:10 You nod.

22:51:29 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "If I'm starting to lose failsafes because of them and they're not leaving I'm eventually going to have to make the call."

22:51:34 Evenia Callseah nods to Bryan Stout.

22:51:35 Johann Schraft nods.

22:51:37 You say, "Exactly."

22:51:44 Nicolette Lawrence asks in a California accent, "How many cans left?"

22:51:46 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Of course."

22:51:49 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "They seem to have gotten a lot smarter though."

22:51:49 Morris says to Nicolette, "Two."

22:51:50 Evenia says to Nicolette, "2."

22:51:51 You say, "There only so many times I'm going to let them shoot at me."

22:51:53 Nicolette Lawrence nods.

22:52:20 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "And again, I'm extremely glad Tanny isn't here for these discussions."

22:52:26 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Why?"

22:52:28 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh god."

22:52:30 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I'm glad she isn't here period."

22:52:31 Evenia Callseah nods and wrinkles her nose.

22:52:38 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

22:52:38 You ask, "Why?"

22:52:43 You say, "I don't know her very well."

22:52:44 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, why?"

22:52:52 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "She is very vehement about not doing delta ops."

22:52:58 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "And?"

22:53:03 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Not just delta."

22:53:03 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Because. She's just a nut job in general."

22:53:04 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "What's wrong with that? It's her choice."

22:53:06 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Very vehement."

22:53:17 Bryan says to Morris, "Because we'd never hear the end of it from her."

22:53:27 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Oh yeah, that's her choice completely. But she will go on and on and on at people who do."

22:53:31 Johann Schraft nods.

22:53:54 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am sure Anfisa and some of the mutuality really would do that too."

22:54:03 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "They wanted to come out here."

22:54:05 Bryan Stout glares.

22:54:32 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Look. We could have a death penalty dicussion...and you know what side of that I'd come down on? Piracy being a capital offense...to me is...a nonissue. I don't want to be the executioner, but if I have to shoot at them and they don't get out in time...it just...it's not something I like, but I do what I have to do. If Tnny feels more strongly about it than I do, then she does."

22:54:46 Johann Schraft nods to Morris Corlew.

22:54:53 Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:54:55 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "It's like...Um. I can't think who it is. but we've got a pilot who flatly refuses to do GMG. The difference is. he doesn't take issue with people that do."

22:54:56 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "She's entited to not participate."

22:55:04 Morris says to Evenia, "James."

22:55:08 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "That's fine."

22:55:11 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yep."

22:55:13 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Why is that? I don't think i've heard this."

22:55:15 Morris says to Bryan, "Doesn't seem like it is."

22:55:18 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have respect for people in general. I believe that we should work together, if we want a chance at surviving the outsiders when they come in force. I'm against senseless killing, but after 2 years and several months, I know by now the difference between senseless killing and self defense."

22:55:32 You nod to Kim Saunders.

22:55:38 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Why isn't it fine that someone doesn't do GMG but doesn't go on and on about others that do?"

22:55:48 Bryan Stout shrugs.

22:55:50 Morris says to Bryan, "I thought you were saying it's fine about what I said..."

22:55:53 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Because that's a personal choice."

22:55:57 Morris says to Bryan, "But it hasn't seemed like it."

22:56:07 Bryan says to Morris, "I nodded in agreement with you."

22:56:22 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "But."

22:56:24 Bryan Stout shrugs helplessly.

22:56:27 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Have I gone on about folks opinions on this? No. The only time I had an issue was Johann's joke about going after Lambdas for lenses."

22:56:36 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Okay, so say we were getting an op together and a barge hopped in and asked to salvage on the op, would you let them?"

22:56:43 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "No."

22:56:45 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Of course not."

22:56:59 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "What I'm trying to say is. It's totally his choice that he doesn't choose to, but he doesn't judge others for doing it. Tanny on the other hand, would go on and on about us doing these ops."

22:57:29 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Why not?"

22:57:47 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm, our government probably would not be too happy."

22:58:09 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Yeah...for one, we'd lose our licenses. But for two, you've gotta consider motivation there."

22:58:27 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "I don't know, they need some money and don't want to steal?"

22:58:39 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "If they wanna just go after materials to help us out? Where's that comin from? Our government wouldn't pay them for it."

22:59:06 Kim Saunders glances at the coordinate rundown.

22:59:32 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "What would be the harm though?"

22:59:39 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "So they throw some debris in the can."

22:59:53 Bryan Stout gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:59:57 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "And what would be the point too? To me it'd look like there was some other motive there."

23:00:35 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Well, I don't know, but it could be a good chance to start a dialog. I would honestly consider it."

23:00:44 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Why not? Sounds reasonable."

23:00:55 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I don't know."

23:00:57 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Better than Akemi wanting to talk to the IFS anyway."

23:01:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's neck.

23:01:12 Kim studies the rundown carefully for a moment before she "asks: "Wow, see all that debris? How many sectors full of debris do you think this oort has? Plenty of room for Lambdas, and all the other factions out here to build their station, and still not have to meet while salvaging. So why do they need from our can? Or want to fill our can?"

23:01:13 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Personally, I don't think trying to talk to the IFS is a bad idea."

23:01:14 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Don't most of us wanna talk to the IFS? I've heard that from countless pilots."

23:01:19 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I'd talk to the IFS if it meant having them on our side."

23:01:40 Kim Saunders nods. "I would agree with that."

23:01:48 You nod.

23:01:53 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I'll talk to the IFS when they jump in to talk and not start shooting the second before they get there."

23:01:56 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "You can't start talks expecting a specific outcome."

23:02:07 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Never said you could."

23:02:12 Vernos says to Nicolette, "May have to go to them for that."

23:02:20 Bryan says to Vernos, "That would be...hard."

23:02:22 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Blurr" has suddenly appeared on sensor scans.

23:02:24 Morris says to Bryan, "You siad you'd talk to the IFS if it meant having them on our side."

23:02:31 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "But the way things operate right now, no. If they ever jumped in, and nothing happened? Sure, why not."

23:02:42 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "That's not going to happen."

23:02:46 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Anyway my point is if the unregs wanted some sort of contact that was nonviolent and could lead to beneficial, I would think it would be worth it."

23:02:46 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Nope."

23:02:53 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We'd need to do something to show that we don't want to fight."

23:02:54 Evenia Callseah nods to Johann Schraft.

23:03:01 You nod to Johann Schraft.

23:03:02 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

23:03:02 Nicolette says to Melinda, "You still have a cruiser?"

23:03:13 Johann says to Melinda, "We could send sol to ifs space in his capsule."

23:03:19 Morris Corlew sighs.

23:03:20 Melinda Michaels shrugs.

23:03:26 Johann Schraft chuckles.

23:03:35 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Don't even wanna think about that."

23:03:43 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Ha, and we get an escape pod back. And can they Rogue rogue them?"

23:03:54 You stand up from a beige sofa.

You can go down.

23:08:30 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "It was not the most pleasant day of my life."

23:08:34 You sit down on a beige sofa.

23:08:37 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Outsiders are rimward."

23:08:38 Johann says to Melinda, "You're probably right, but who knows, we might have been going around their antispinward border for all we know."

23:08:41 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.

23:08:49 Melinda says to Johann, "Possibly."

23:08:58 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "Jinu and EAOS are coreward?"

23:09:03 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "EAOS are here."

23:09:11 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The actual EAOS."

23:09:15 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I mean galactic EAOS."

23:09:15 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Not the human EAOS."

23:09:21 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Oh. Yeah...that I don't know."

23:09:22 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I remember on the Ideran mission, we encountered a few patrols in outsider space, but the last, the one that managed to catch up to us, we encoungered a few hundred lightyears outside their space, on the way back."

23:09:23 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

23:09:33 Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders.

23:09:37 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "The clans are Spinward and Anti-Spinward."

23:09:40 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Has anyone ever seen them?"

23:09:45 Melinda Michaels nods to Vernos Bailey.

23:09:45 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Aren't they the ones with the lowel?"

23:09:46 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Outsiders?"

23:09:46 Melinda says to Bryan, "No."

23:09:48 Johann says to Kim, "Yeah, that's why I'm not so quick to say we were right on their doorstep on my trip."

23:09:51 Rogue Romano examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

23:09:52 [League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Control Room]

23:09:52 This is the rather cramped hub of the space station. A starmap, coordinate rundown display, and a few basic station controls are present. There's also a sofa!
You see a beige sofa, a metal table, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.

23:09:56 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

23:10:01 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:10:09 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We know nothing about them."

23:10:32 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "They could be IFS, outsiders or, or an unknown race."

23:10:35 Kim says to Johann, "If their space is thousands of lightyears, tens of thousands, or who knows how big, then 200 or 300 lightyears could be considered their doorstep."

23:10:41 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "And the IFS are where?"

23:10:46 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "The EAOS does...and the alliance governments I'd imagine. But us as pilots and civilians...the general public...those messages have never been shared."

23:11:01 Morris says to Vernos, "Northeast basically."

23:11:02 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I mean, a patrol took us out pretty easy, I'd hate to be even a few hundred lightyears away from their actual space."

23:11:06 Johann says to Kim, "Yeah, well if that's the case, flying around our space is still at their doorstep."

23:11:07 Morris says to Vernos, "Coreward and Spinward."

23:11:19 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I suppose so."

23:11:34 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I dunno about coreward."

23:11:52 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Well, I'll leave going Rrimward to necessity for myself personally."

23:11:53 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I've never had those shirts."

23:12:00 Johann says to Vernos, "Ifs are definitely Spinward."

23:12:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's neck.

23:12:12 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Emily has one, and I think Morris has one."

23:12:15 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Ather's told me Spinward but to the east a bit."

23:12:16 Morris Corlew nods. "I do."

23:12:17 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have a tapestry in my apartment with such a map drawing on it, but...."

23:12:25 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Nobody really knows exactly."

23:12:28 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Nope."

23:12:31 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Maybe Acord or the EAOS."

23:12:35 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "It's a best guess kinda thing."

23:12:39 Johann Schraft nods.

23:12:54 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Jinu from what I understand are about 3000 lightyears coreward and antispinward."

23:12:55 Vernos says to Morris, "Well it would not be easy but I heard they sent out a signal to call Korie back."

23:13:06 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Why not do that for the IFS."

23:13:10 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "And ask to meet."

23:13:18 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Who did?"

23:13:24 Morris says to Vernos, "Think I missed somethin there..."

23:13:26 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "The resistance."

23:13:30 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Us?"

23:13:33 Vernos Bailey nods.

23:13:34 Johann says to Vernos, "I don't think we know how they communicate>."

23:13:35 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ather told us the other day he believes it to be at least 5000 or maybe even 10000, but yeah, I don't know."

23:13:36 Morris Corlew nods.

23:13:41 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Ouch."

23:13:44 Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders.

23:13:52 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Sol tried to tell me it was 300."

23:13:56 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yeah, I have heard 3000, but I don't know for sure."

23:14:00 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "But we've covered that space pretty well."

23:14:02 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Like Sol knows anything."

23:14:04 Nicolette Lawrence yawns.

23:14:05 Johann Schraft chuckles.

23:14:07 Melinda says to Morris, "No we haven't."

23:14:07 Morris says to Nicolette, "Well yeah."

23:14:08 You chuckle.

23:14:08 Kim Saunders frowns.

23:14:13 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Not really."

23:14:13 Melinda says to Morris, "It's huge."

23:14:25 Vernos says to Melinda, "What is the furtherest you have been out."

23:14:28 Ted Warburton walks in from below.

23:14:32 Kim Saunders waves to Ted Warburton.

23:14:33 You wave to Ted Warburton.

23:14:34 Morris says to Melinda, "It is, but if it was only 300 light-years out you'd think with as much as we've covered that general area, we woulda seen some sign?"

23:14:35 Evenia Callseah waves to Ted Warburton.

23:14:40 Morris Corlew waves.

23:14:40 Ted Warburton waves.

23:14:42 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Hah, do It's incredible how much a 1 degree difference makes after 10 0lightyears of travel."

23:14:43 Melinda says to Morris, "Oh that, yeah."

23:14:48 Rogue Romano waves to Ted Warburton.

23:14:50 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels. "That's what I meant."

23:14:51 Ted Warburton sits down on a beige sofa.

23:14:58 Melinda says to Vernos, "A couple thousand light-years."

23:14:58 Ted Warburton stretches.

23:15:03 Morris says to Melinda, "If they were 300 light-years Coreward, we'd have seen some sign of 'em."

23:15:05 Vernos Bailey nods to Melinda Michaels.

23:15:11 Evenia Callseah pokes Ted Warburton in the ribs! "Wake up."

23:15:15 Melinda says to Morris, "Should."

23:15:16 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "How far can we realistically manage to achieve if we turned everything off on the longest traveling ship?"

23:15:18 Morris Corlew nods.

23:15:19 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I'm trying."

23:15:24 Johann says to Bryan, "One way or not?"

23:15:25 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:15:27 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "One way."

23:15:28 Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "One way?"

23:15:40 Johann says to Bryan, "Maybe ten days?"

23:15:43 Ted Warburton examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

23:15:44 Ted Warburton helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:15:44 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Hmm."

23:15:45 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Augmented explorer with a Siren and a goo pod is probably the best shot because of the help in drain rate."

23:15:45 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I'd guess 2800ish light-years, maybe 3000."

23:15:46 Nicolette says to Melinda, "You used to talk about doing that."

23:15:47 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:15:54 Nicolette says to Melinda, "Take the galleon as far as it could go."

23:15:57 Vernos says to Johann, "With a recharge station?"

23:16:01 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Still not near far enough for the ginu apparently."

23:16:01 Melinda says to Nicolette, "Yup."

23:16:12 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "If we use a ship that does not have goo."

23:16:17 Vernos says to Johann, "Maybe 5000?"

23:16:33 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, only mutuality pilots can get one of those?"

23:16:43 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "To be safe, I'd guess between twenty-six and twenty-eight hundred."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Taking a station won't fix your furnace, so...that will limit you too."

23:16:49 Johann says to Vernos, "OH, now if you took a mod transport, and filled it with recharge..."

23:16:51 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Goo? Do I even wanna know?"

23:16:53 Johann Schraft gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:16:59 Morris says to Evenia, "No. You don't."

23:17:00 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I qwas thinking that."

23:17:00 Morris Corlew grins.

23:17:02 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Was."

23:17:10 Kim Saunders grins.

23:17:11 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Recharge stations, hmm."

23:17:20 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Would that fit in a galleon?"

23:17:24 Vernos says to Johann, "I was thinking something like an arrow with a mod transport close behind."

23:17:26 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Scout might."

23:17:31 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Not a transport though."

23:17:35 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "But then no warships if we needed them."

23:17:35 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Scout will not."

23:17:38 Morris Corlew nods.

23:17:46 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I think you could hit 4000."

23:17:49 Morris says to Melinda, "Galleon docking bay holds how much with the upgrade?"

23:17:54 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "If it was a one-way trip."

23:17:58 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "45."

23:18:01 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Oh."

23:18:05 "I think I'll trust you on that." Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "Exploration including goo just does not sound like something I wanna know about."

23:18:06 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I don't know why I thought it was 65."

23:18:25 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:18:33 Melinda says to Johann, "Maybe but it would be pushing. I did 2600 light-years and made it home with 25% charge and a little less than 10% on the furnace. This was the sloop."

23:18:35 Nicolette says to Evenia, "You know about the goo, we've talked about it before. Anfisa's ship."

23:18:49 Evenia Callseah gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:18:56 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I know I don't."

23:18:57 Johann says to Melinda, "I'm talking one-way trip with a module transport and seven recharge stations."

23:19:03 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Oh."

23:19:07 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Of course Pierre traded his docking bay for a module bay that held like, 7 modules? Not sure on the amount, it's how they were able to build the recharge and transmitter out at the aquarium."

23:19:07 Evenia says to Nicolette, "Oh! The AI thing?"

23:19:09 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Maybe 2500 max?"

23:19:12 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Slower drive."

23:19:21 Morris says to Johann, "I was lookin into that."

23:19:24 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Where the pilot is naked in this vat of goo and basically becomes the ship computer, can hear and see absolutely everything that goes on in the ship."

23:19:25 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

23:19:30 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yeah, I'm thinking 400 lightyears before you need to recharge."

23:19:34 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Eww."

23:19:35 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "You could push 2700 I think. Depending on flow."

23:19:36 Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:19:47 Kim Saunders nods. "Yeah, no secrets, the pilot knows... everything you do, say and whisper."

23:19:48 Kim Saunders grins.

23:19:51 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "So yeah, maybe close to 3000."

23:19:54 Johann Schraft shudders.

23:19:57 Morris Corlew nods. "Slow flow you're screwed. Storm you...might get further."

23:20:05 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Yeah um...I'm good. I'll take the next stop thanks. Where ever that might be."

23:20:08 Nicolette Lawrence exclaims in a California accent, "Use the bolt!"

23:20:11 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:20:13 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Woo bolt."

23:20:26 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "That was the most awful trip ever."

23:20:32 Morris says to Evenia, "I spent a fair amount of time in that ship and knowing you have zero privacy is a bit nervewracking."

23:20:34 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "What happened?"

23:20:43 Morris Corlew taps a leather cord necklace with a small vaguely geometric reddish-brown stone suspended in a small crystal ball.

23:20:48 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "That's Anfisa's ship, right?"

23:20:49 "I couldn't do that." Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "Life and death. Sure. But otherwise..."

23:20:52 Morris Corlew nods to Johann Schraft.

23:20:55 Kim Saunders nods.

23:20:58 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Yeah I'm good. I'll go on someone elses."

23:21:06 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Yeah, same."

23:21:10 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Just Aisling trying to get to Feng Wo in a ship that couldn't even make it to Andy's, and was trying to use a bolt to compensate for that fact, with there being no control at all over what storm the bolt created or where it took her."

23:21:13 Vernos says to Johann, "I had figured one way without the recharge station.. you might could hit 3500 before you had to build a station to recharge."

23:21:16 Morris says to Evenia, "Well, I didn't really know what I was getting into the first time, second time I dind't have much of a choice really."

23:21:17 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:21:18 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I had a chance to travel aboard, didn't because I had other things to do, but yeah, that would make me unsettled. No privacy."

23:21:19 Vernos says to Johann, "Depending on flow."

23:21:23 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I don't think it would be an issue. She has never acknowledged my presence anyway."

23:21:29 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Mine either."

23:21:32 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Thankfully."

23:21:32 Evenia Callseah opens a camera bag.

23:21:34 An orange digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

23:21:40 Morris says to Vernos, "Wow....no."

23:22:13 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Watch Nicolette kill me."

23:22:14 Evenia Callseah removes a space imaging photograph of Nouveau Quebec Station from a camera bag.

23:22:18 Evenia Callseah sighs.

23:22:20 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Mod transport full of stations, you're looking at 2500 total max."

23:22:20 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Not that."

23:22:28 Nicolette Lawrence stands up from a beige sofa.

23:22:29 Nicolette Lawrence stomps down.

23:22:30 Evenia Callseah puts a space imaging photograph of Nouveau Quebec Station in a camera bag.

23:22:34 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:22:35 Evenia Callseah laughs.

23:22:49 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Oh, I think you can get a little farther than that."

23:22:49 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Might get a bit more than that if you have exceptional flow."

23:22:56 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Not 3500 though."

23:23:01 Evenia Callseah presses a button next to a speaker.

23:23:01 Evenia Callseah says into the PA, "Nicolette, I won't do it. Come back."

23:23:24 Vernos says to Johann, "How close did you get to Outsider space?"

23:23:28 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "In part, it's a slower drive."

23:23:32 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "With a high-low and systems disabled, averaging 100 lightyears per day, I think you could get 400-500 lightyears before you recharge."

23:23:34 Evenia Callseah closes a camera bag.

23:23:40 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Uh..."

23:23:46 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "With a high-low, maybe."

23:23:52 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "But that'll slow you down even more."

23:24:01 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Also deadens your sensors."

23:24:06 You nod.

23:24:11 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yeah, well, if you're just going for distance..."

23:24:34 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Honestly I would want to push the blockade but not cross it."

23:24:42 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "What does the high low do again."

23:24:42 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Just so we know where it is."

23:24:53 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "It takes an average of about 36 hours in my mod transport to get to Andys."

23:25:12 Morris says to Bryan, "Adds tremendously to charge but takes from all your other systems."

23:25:15 Bryan Stout nods.

23:25:20 Evenia says to Bryan, "Basically cuts power to stuff a bit, but gives you a ton more charge."

23:25:21 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Weapons, sensors, even rift speed."

23:25:31 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Flowmill on the capsule woo."

23:25:46 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Capsule'd be a good choice but...you'd never know if you were there or not."

23:25:51 Johann Schraft chuckles.

23:25:54 Bryan Stout laughs.

23:26:02 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Probably a good way to pass the blockade."

23:26:05 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "And you'd go kiboomski in a hurry."

23:26:05 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "You might fly all the way through before you realized it."

23:26:11 You chuckle.

23:26:30 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Holy shit, I'm...Boom. Heading home again."

23:26:34 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Maybe. But if they did see ya? Poof."

23:26:35 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:26:37 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "In an instant."

23:26:52 You say, "For sure."

23:26:53 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Still, if you were purely going for distance, I think it's not unreasonable to hit 3000. That's assuming you find nowhere along the way to stop and recharge as well."

23:26:53 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Assuming they could catch you, I guess their rift drives are far superior to ours."

23:27:09 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Solar might get you the furthest."

23:27:10 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:27:18 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "But that's kinda risky too."

23:27:19 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "What's that solar plating do?"

23:27:25 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Assuming you get lucky enough to find a place to charge."

23:27:41 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Takes advantage of solar energy to charge the ship's battery."

23:27:42 Evenia Callseah nods. "That's the part I don't like about solar."

23:27:44 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Aisling told me I wouldn't like solar plating, and she was right."

23:27:48 Morris Corlew nods to Johann Schraft. "That's the big risk."

23:27:52 Johann Schraft nods.

23:28:06 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I mean...possibly your best bet is to tandem a couple ships."

23:28:19 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I'd rather shovel my ass off, than have to stress about finding the right place to charge."

23:28:25 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Yep."

23:28:26 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

23:28:26 Bryan Stout chuckles.

23:28:34 "She can't stand shoveling." Morris Corlew chuckles. "Course...she's passed out from doin it, so I get it."

23:29:11 Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "Oh I get why she prefers it, but I'd rather a furnace if I had a choice."

23:29:21 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I never knew that."

23:29:22 Morris says to Evenia, "Me too. I don't mind a little sweat."

23:29:48 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Whatever works. I'm built for shoveling."

23:29:49 Bryan Stout shrugs.

23:29:54 Morris Corlew nods to Bryan Stout.

23:29:56 Evenia says to Morris, "Me neither. It's healthy. Clean out your systems."

23:29:58 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "It's good exercise."

23:30:00 Morris Corlew nods.

23:30:04 You grin.

23:30:06 Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Group showers?"

23:30:09 Melinda Michaels grins.

23:30:09 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Shoveling is sometimes actually pretty nice, something to do while sitting mostly still on a trip."

23:30:10 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I wonder if a trickle charge plant would reduce the ware on the furnace and/or solar panels."

23:30:16 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:30:27 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "No."

23:30:33 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:30:33 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "That one we're looking at takes from overall charge though."

23:30:36 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "It would just make the trickle charge faster."

23:30:41 Evenia Callseah grins at Melinda Michaels. "I knew someone would go there. I was waiting."

23:30:48 Melinda Michaels grins at Evenia Callseah.

23:30:49 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:30:50 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yeah, less time being used, so less ware."

23:30:56 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "No."

23:30:56 Nicolette Lawrence stomps in from below.

23:30:57 Nicolette Lawrence sits down on a beige sofa.

23:31:05 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

23:31:08 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Nah. Same wear. Wear is based on how much you charge, not how long it takes."

23:31:15 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "That is sad."

23:31:17 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The furnace is based on the amount of debris it has to pump."

23:31:21 Morris Corlew nods.

23:31:28 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Like if you have 10% damage."

23:31:37 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Wait. Group showers. Pumping. And...Okay. I'm going to stop there."

23:31:42 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "It'll be 3% on the furnace."

23:31:44 You laugh at Evenia Callseah.

23:31:45 Kim Saunders giggles.

23:31:48 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "No matter how long it takes you."

23:31:48 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "You so don't wanna."

23:31:51 Melinda Michaels grins at Evenia Callseah.

23:32:13 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Doesn't matter if you're usin iron in the furnace or hydrogen...the wear'll be the same, even though the iron'll take a heck of a lot longer to charge ya up."

23:32:19 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."

23:32:25 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "That is sad."

23:32:59 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Pity you can't have all three on one ship, furnace, plates, flomill."

23:33:03 Evenia says to Johann, "I will pout for you, because you're probably too manly to pout for yourself."

23:33:05 Evenia Callseah pouts.

23:33:06 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I was just getting answered based on curiousity."

23:33:07 Johann Schraft grins at Evenia Callseah.

23:33:10 You grin.

23:33:15 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Would be nice."

23:33:17 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Same as...with solar, the wear'll be the same if you stop at an oort that's fairly dim or at a pre-stellar that's brighter than Sol."

23:33:39 Morris says to Vernos, "Nothin wrong with bein curious."

23:34:07 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I still think a capsule would be the best bet to get past the jinu blockade."

23:34:15 Bryan Stout grins.

23:34:18 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Don't be what's his face."

23:34:18 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Possible, but it's pretty risky."

23:34:20 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Unless the lowell has something like stealth tech."

23:34:28 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "The lowell is not stealthy."

23:34:35 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "It has that pwd thing doesn't it?"

23:34:35 Morris says to Vernos, "Nah...the response when they did the test launch was uh...dramatic."

23:34:52 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yeah, even launching the damn thing causes problems."

23:34:55 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:34:58 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Right then. So all we need is a totally augmented ship. Solar. Furnace. Flomill. Also all the creature comforts of a galleon. Including sails. Oh. And a 300 unit storage bay for debris. I'll get on that."

23:34:58 Bryan Stout nods.

23:34:59 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I dunno. But I sure would love to see its status display."

23:35:06 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm, I wish I had been present for a test flight of the Lowell."

23:35:09 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:35:17 Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders. "Me too."

23:35:23 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "It was neat."

23:35:26 Morris Corlew laughs.

23:35:28 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "It would be amazing if they could get it functioning again."

23:35:33 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "It is."

23:35:34 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's neck.

23:35:36 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "They got it moving."

23:35:36 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh."

23:35:41 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "And they had a weapons test."

23:35:53 You say, "Oh wow. I missed that."

23:35:56 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "That was the first time Mr. Kelsey warned us of an invasion."

23:36:01 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Wow."

23:36:09 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Really, interesting."

23:36:14 Vernos says to Johann, "Did they help."

23:36:16 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "How many cruisers did we lose that day?"

23:36:20 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "None."

23:36:20 Kim says to you in a New Bristol accent, "And I missed that too, I think long before I became a pilot."

23:36:24 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I thought we di."

23:36:25 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Did."

23:36:26 You nod to Kim Saunders.

23:36:33 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Now Johann is really showing how long he's been around."

23:36:35 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Not on the first test."

23:36:39 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Man."

23:36:41 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Oh...no, the second."

23:36:42 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "The shit I missed."

23:36:45 Bryan Stout sighs.

23:36:51 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I don't know. I was not around for the second."

23:37:06 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I think it was two anyway? Nissi's and..."

23:37:07 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:37:12 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "A bunch."

23:37:16 Morris Corlew nods. "Somethin."

23:37:19 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Ather."

23:37:20 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Anyway, it was dramatic."

23:37:23 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

23:37:40 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "You want dramatic that's the day we lost three cruisers in an IFS invasion."

23:37:41 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm, honestly. If I compare the pilots that are active today and 2 years ago, I am curious who were around and present for those tests, well, when did they even happen?"

23:38:06 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Three? Sanity."

23:38:12 Johann Schraft nods.

23:38:21 Morris says to Kim, "Dunno the date. I was in flight school when I heard about it. Was one of my simulator days so I crashed with the news and slept partway through half the report."

23:38:29 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Three cruisers, from what I understand, that is a sad day for conquest."

23:38:36 Morris Corlew grins at Vernos Bailey.

23:38:37 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "WE stopped losing them once we got rid of the ships that interdicted."

23:38:43 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Not just conquest, but for people in general."

23:38:48 You nod.

23:38:50 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

23:39:00 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:39:11 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "But mine was the first ship in there, it lasted all of about a minute."

23:39:17 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Fuck."

23:39:18 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Though I admit. Being a whip and therefore curious. I'd love to have seen how bad that did make conquest."

23:39:27 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Well, they weren't all League."

23:39:31 Morris says to Evenia, "I've seen a couple galleons before, so it's not pretty."

23:39:44 Evenia says to Morris, "Ouch. That would hurt like a bitch."

23:39:49 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

23:39:51 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "They did."

23:40:14 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "No, three galleons."

23:40:19 You ask, "So, when's the next op planned for?"

23:40:19 Emily Ford suddenly awakens.

23:40:25 Vernos Bailey glances down at his tasteful gold watch with diamond accents momentarily.

23:40:32 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I'd say 2300."

23:40:34 You say to Emily, "Hi."

23:40:40 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

23:40:42 Evenia says to Johann in an Ars Magnan accent, "At least you aren't naming your cruisers like you name your corvette. What number would we be up to now?"

23:40:44 Ted Warburton waves to Emily Ford.

23:40:47 Emily Ford asks in a Yorkshire accent, "Ug, we're still alive?"

23:40:52 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "No."

23:40:58 Morris says to Emily in an Appalachian accent, "Nope."

23:41:01 Kim says to Emily in a New Bristol accent, "No, welcome to the after life. I have come to haunt you."

23:41:03 Morris says to Emily in an Appalachian accent, "This is the afterlife."

23:41:07 You chuckle.

23:41:08 Morris Corlew laughs at Kim Saunders.

23:41:13 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I am completely not alive. You're just dreaming about me."

23:41:19 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "You wish."

23:41:20 Morris says to Evenia, "Zombie."

23:41:22 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:41:23 Emily Ford says in a Yorkshire accent, "Oh good, I thought for a moment I was still cursed with having to work to earn credits for food."

23:41:30 Kim Saunders laughs.

23:41:33 You chuckle.

23:41:37 Bryan Stout smirks.

23:41:38 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Braaaaains."

23:41:42 Kim says to Emily, "You are, who ever said that would end?"

23:41:43 Johann says to Emily, "The afterlife is nothing but salvaging, didn't you know?"

23:41:45 Kim Saunders giggles.

23:41:48 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:41:52 Bryan Stout snores.

23:41:53 Emily Ford stares at Johann Schraft.

23:41:59 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "You went from bari corpses to brains."

23:42:03 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:42:05 Emily Ford says in a Yorkshire accent, "Never say that again. Ever."

23:42:09 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I can't help that I got hungry."

23:42:10 Shule hides from Evenia.

23:42:26 Evenia Callseah laughs at you.

23:42:26 Johann says to Emily, "You can't move on until you've filled 300 hlv's with spacesuit gloves."

23:42:33 Kim Saunders laughs.

23:42:33 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh my god shhhh."

23:42:35 Vernos says to Emily, "We were discussing ways to approach the outside blockade to jinu space."

23:42:39 Evenia says to Emily, "Not just that. But it's salvaging little tiny 2-meter asteroids."

23:42:52 Emily Ford says in a Yorkshire accent, "I wish you all the best wishes with your grapples."

23:42:55 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

23:42:58 Ted Warburton laughs.

23:43:05 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:43:14 Johann says to Emily, "But Every time you find a matching pair, that pair disappears."

23:43:20 Evenia Callseah laughs.

23:43:22 Kim Saunders grins.

23:43:25 Kim Saunders exclaims in a New Bristol accent, "Awh!"

23:43:28 Evenia Callseah pokes Johann Schraft in the ribs! "You are officially horrible."

23:43:31 Nicolette Lawrence stands up from a beige sofa.

23:43:31 You say, "See, I knew I was headed for hell in the after life."

23:43:31 Nicolette Lawrence stomps down.

23:43:39 Emily says to Johann in a Yorkshire accent, "What constitutes a matching pair? Two left, two right or one of each?"

23:43:46 Johann says to Emily, "One of each."

23:43:58 Emily Ford says in a Yorkshire accent, "Then I'll only salvage left handed gloves."

23:44:01 Evenia says to you in an Ars Magnan accent, "Of course you are."

23:44:08 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

23:44:19 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Carry On" has launched from League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station.

23:44:27 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yep, for 150000 units 300 hlv's."

23:44:29 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Carry On" has launched from the docking bay.

23:44:30 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Who's that?"

23:44:35 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Nicolette."

23:44:42 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Carry On" has disappeared from sensor scans.

23:44:46 Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:44:47 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh my."

23:44:47 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I forgot to mention they have the compresser, a double storage plant, and a storage bot."

23:44:52 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "What rattled her cage?"

23:44:53 Emily Ford says in a Yorkshire accent, "I'll contact you in fifty years, once I've filled the first hundred."

23:44:57 Johann Schraft grins.

23:45:04 Bryan Stout shrugs.

23:45:07 "What usually does?" Morris Corlew looks at Ted Warburton and shrugs.

23:45:13 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "I dunno. It's Nicolette."

23:45:14 Ted Warburton sighs.

23:45:21 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Answer: Humans."

23:45:22 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:45:25 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I didn't do it this time."

23:45:26 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Carry On" has suddenly appeared on sensor scans.

23:45:27 Johann says to Evenia, "I'm horrible you say?"

23:45:31 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Hey look."

23:45:31 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Oh."
Ted Warburton laughs.

23:45:36 Johann Schraft removes a deck of Horrible People cards from a small black leather backpack.

23:45:39 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "There she is again."

23:45:41 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Maybe checkin the flow."

23:45:55 Emily Ford presses some buttons on the communication board.

23:45:56 To all ships in the sector, this station transmits: "Is the accelerator anything like the pink, fleshy tunnel?"

23:46:01 Evenia says to Melinda in an Ars Magnan accent, "For once, we're both innocent."

23:46:05 Melinda Michaels laughs.

23:46:08 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

23:46:11 You say to Evenia, "You are never innocent."

23:46:18 Emily says to Evenia, "You can't convince me you were ever innocent."

She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her very short, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, and a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and gold dichroic glass, a slinky light blue halterneck top with a v-neck, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked daggers around her waist, a pair of torn skinny black low rise jeans, and a pair of chunky black leather boots with numerous straps and buckles. She is also wearing an eye-catchi
23:51:27 ng gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both shoulders, back, both biceps, both elbows, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
