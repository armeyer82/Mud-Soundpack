Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a clear plastic food storage
container, Shule Elemmire's workbench, a small white trash can, a compact red
refrigerator, a white microwave oven, a blue plastic food storage container, and
a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers here.

We made 11.16 LTC before the drive needed repairs again. We've been getting
blasted by energy discharges from a storm the past hour, so it's a small wonder
that the drive didn't need help earlier. Extra-long range Torus NDB signal
strength was 54%.

We made approximately 1.5 LTC before the drive quit on us. The storm is still
bouncing us around. We'll get clear for a few minutes, and then it'll catch up
and we'll get pushed upwards again. It's a bit like skipping a stone on a pond.
The extra-long range Torus NDB signal strength is now 53%.

Internal repairs only this time. We made 23.4 light-grand cycles before the
drive started making noises again. The storm is really beating the drive up,
unfortunately. We've adjusted course to 0.0 90.0 to try to get out of its path,
rather than put up with repairs every hour.

Someone forgot to replace one of the two sets of spare rift drive tools. It's
fine to use them if you need to (that's why they're there!), but when they're
not being used for repairs they go in the gold-toned tool case on the shelf in
the storage room. If you need a set of rift drive tools of your own, come talk
to me.

After having traveled 1.2 ltc on various headings in hopes of avoiding the
storm, the rift started to break down again. We made repairs. After having
traveled another 8 LGC we decided to take a heading of 90 85 which seemed to
take us away from the stormfront. We kept this heading until we had traveled a
total of 18 LGC where we changed the heading to 45 60. This took us away from
the storm. 1.45 LTC from where we repaired the drive, we resumed our original
heading of 45 15.

You blink heavily and then doze off.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes
close slowly and it appears to sleep.
You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place
seems to go on forever.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new

You blink heavily and then doze off.
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.
Cindy the small red sabre-toothed felo wanders in from the east.

Cindy the small red sabre-toothed felo stares curiously up at Lily Kaise.
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
Cindy the small red sabre-toothed felo rubs up against a long plasteel counter,
purring softly.

headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
Lily Kaise kisses you.
Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered
with brightly hued butterflies.
Lily Kaise pulls a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the

Michael Winters's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We need to think
about charge soon."
Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anything going on?"
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Charge is down to
20%."
Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're fine."

then places it back on the conveyor belt.

re-stock in general anyway. I've got plenty of precursor parts, I just haven't
have a robot turn them into useful things."
Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup I like to keep
those basic parts crafted and on hand."
Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along
with yours.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Lily Kaise glides in from the east.
Lily Kaise kisses you.

A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Destroyed alien starships and space stations fill space in this area. Unlike
similar sites, the damage appears to be rather one-sided, with most of the
debris consisting of non-military equipment that is nonetheless rather
battle-scorched.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on

Subject: Chamber of Dust

We've left the Chamber of Dust after having used the blast chamber to recharge
the ship battery. We had made 11.5 LTC from the last set of repairs by the time
we arrived at the site. No luminosity to speak of, grade 90 and 100 debris. Lily
took a space imager photo. This site was a one-side battle, lots of station
remnants and mostly non-military wrecks. The extra long-range Torus NDB signal
strength was 44%. We resumed course 45.0 15.0 when we left.

Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small blue insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startingly like a single
unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass
is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a
glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created
here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Akemi says, "And we're here."
Akemi Bando presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Kim says to Akemi, "Ever found planets in here?"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
"It'd have to be something from outside the system that got caught, if there was
one," Akemi says. "It doesn't seem likely to me there would be any there."

in against her legs.

With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.

The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

Morris says to Liam in an Old Earth accent, "'going ok...you?"
Liam blinks his eyes and then slowly opens the left one to look at Nissi.  He
then speaks towards Morris and says, "It's going good...I think!  Just letting
Nissi use my head as a keyboard."
Morris chuckles.
"We're zipping along in a spaceship 700 light-years from its home port, riding
through the hyperdimensional rift while we look for interesting things," Akemi
says. "I think it's going pretty well. Hopefully we'll start finding more places
soon."

You grin at Akemi.
Nissi says, "The exploration starts at 1000 lightyears."
"Woo!" exclaims Lily in a New Earth accent.

"Yeah, that's a pretty fair statement," Liam says. "After that it seems like the
universe becomes more dense."
Nissi says, "And on the way back it's the crew that becomes more dense."

You chuckle.
Morris laughs.
Liam grins.  "Yeah, you won't get an argument out of me for that one.  By the
time we come back there's usually one pilot we want to send ahead or leave
behind."
"A little over 41 LTC before we arrive at 1000," Lily says.
"1000 Light-Years," says Lily.

You nod to Lily.
Akemi asks, "I wonder why that is?"
"I will try not to be that pilot...especially if it's the left behind option,"
Morris says.

You grin at Morris.
"Well... those who expect instant gratification," says Lily, "who never grew
beyond about the age of 4."
"I dunno," says Nissi. "People like heading out to explore or having a
destination. But once we're just waiting and waiting to get back home and
nothing else is ahead of us, people get a little antsy."
Lily says, "True."
Morris says, "Then those are not the ones who should be out here...it's about
waiting...seeing what we find. I have not yet asked, are we there yet."
Lily says, "I always get pretty sad going back."
Lily laughs.
Morris gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "Actually, we've been
THERE...several times."
'If Lily had it her way, she'd just stay out exploring forever.
"If Lily had it her way," you say, "she'd just stay out exploring forever."
"I would," says Lily.

'This is true.
You say, "This is true."
Morris says, "Yeah, darmed power needs."

Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "One of these dayse I'll get over to
Feng Wo and put solar panels on something. That will help a little provided we
find good resources."

You nod and grin at Lily.
"I'm not a fan of solar panels," Liam says. "If they didn't break down as much I
would be, but asteroid fields are more plentiful than stars."
"I just wonder how long it takes to charge if the luminocity is Sol Equivalent

You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

Lily Kaise presses a silver button on the front of a large red popcorn popper
with chrome accents, and several dozen unpopped corn kernels fall into the
machine's microwave popping bin. The microwave switches on, and the kernels
begin popping. A blower activates, sweeping the popped popcorn up and around the
bin where waving nozzles spray them thoroughly with the desired flavorings,
incidentally leaving quite a mess on the walls of the popping bin, but as the
finished popcorn is sucked into a small red and white paper bag that has sprung
up from the bowels of the machine, a mechanical arm tipped with a squeegee
emerges and cleans the walls of the bin, afterwards grabbing the bag, thrusting
it into her waiting hand, and disappearing whence it came. For a brief moment
the jubilant cacophony of a choir of singing elves can be heard in the distance;
then the sound fades away, and the machine shuts down with a quiet wheeze.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of soft light blue slippers.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.
Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

1JIK6.I80
After having traveled 9.9 LTC from Chamber of dust, we spotted Pre-Stellar
Object 8423-3084. Akemi piloted the ship there. We found grade 70 and 80 debris,
luminosity was sol-equivalent and we took a space image. After this we continued
our heading of 45 15.
total distance between chamber of Dust and Pre-Stellar Object 8423-3084 is 10.4
ltc. This would make the total distance traveled from the Radio bubble roughly
84 ltc.

We made about 5.2 LTC from Pre-Stellar Object 8423-3084 before the drive up and
quit on us. The extra long-range Torus  NDB signal strength is 33%. We made
repairs and got going again without incident.

1JIK9.9G7
We spotted the final dust at a distance of 13.32 LGC after having traveled 13.96
ltc from where the drive was last repaired. Simon navigated the ship there. We
found what looked like the remains of a naval battle and a space-based infantry.
There was no luminosity as is to be expected, and we found grade 80 to 100
debris.
Anfisa charted our location which was 98.56 LTC from Coreward reach. The signal
strength from the Extra long range NDB at the torus was 23 %. After having taken
an image we continued on our heading of 45 15.

You cuddle up to Lily.
Something tickles the back of your neck.
Lily cuddles up to you.
The room grows a bit warmer.
Jasmin the small red glowing felo wanders in from the east.
l lily
Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
She is wearing nothing.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips,
groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed
pillow on it, purring softly.
You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't
recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Jasmin the small red glowing felo.
Jasmin the small red glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand.
