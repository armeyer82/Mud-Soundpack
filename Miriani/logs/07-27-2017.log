I'm just confused as to why you're still telling me them even though you know I'm claimed. I don't know that you'd want me to flirt with you while I'm with this person or even that you'd want me to sleep with you on the side or something. I always had the impression that you would want someone who is very loyal to you and that you're not into being dessert. You seem to be the type to want to be the main course. Do I think you're still beautiful. Of course, but I don't want to seem like the guy who just sleeps around with every girl."

I am curious though what you would have said if I had told you that I wanted to be intimate with you. Clearly you weren't ready yet and I'm not going to force you to do something you're obviously not comfortable with yet."

02:09 [General Communication] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "I haven't heard of that happening again, would you be interested in running something to see if we can have a lil fun?"

So yes I still want to show you and you would come home late that there really wasn't much time to become intimate. I had been ready for awhile but I wanted it to be when we had some quality time together."

02:15 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Well no not exactly from the man I love. If we had been together a few weeks and you made advances that I wasn't comfortable with and you persisted, then I would certainly call you an insensitive jerk."

02:17 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "But had you had an honest discussion with me, I would have tried to meet your terms somewhere because I care so much and perhaps me taking more risks would have been good. You just kept saying it was ok and you shouldn't have."

02:20 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I kept telling you it was ok, because I put your wants and needs before mine. I didn't want to do anything to pressure you. I know that's probably hard to believe now, but it is true."

02:21 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "But you need to communicate your needs so that I would understand. I'm not inflexible Tibo and I want more than anything for us to be happy and to make you satisfied and happy."

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

You do bully, the fact you're starting a post and whining about it is amusing. Yes you may not call someone out, but you emotionally bully people. Actually long term what you do is worse. It's highly amusing that you think you can dish it out in a more manipulative and silent way, yet you shouldn't be open to other types of bullying? Also, some people can define the difference between ic and ooc. I have never bullyed ooc, but I know my char has bullyed IC. It's called playing a certain type of person. Anyways I am going to read more of this whine fest boring moronic thread. It's amusing.

Hello there,

I have a serious concern about not only the quantity of bullying in the game, but the direction that this bullying is going and the severity of it. There is a disproportionate amount of this behavior going on and it has grown far beyond the simplicity of the browbeatings of the past.

I have witnessed on many occasions people being slandered, berated and harassed in ways that if this were real life, people could be brought up on civil and criminal charges. Yes, I realize this is only a game, but in our current age of information technology, games are becoming more real for more people. There may be a disclosure from the hosts on the opening page about Miriani being vastly uncensored and play at your own risk and the hosts aren't libel for what is said or happens to you here - but that isn't a 'get out of jail free' card for people to make others feel some kind of way behind the keyboard.

Speaking of which, this is from the official policy on Harassment, Discrimination, and Threats:

When it comes to harassment, a general rule of thumb is to consider your actions from both an in and out of character standpoint. If what you're doing is intended to make the person playing the character feel negative emotions, it likely constitutes harassment.

Now, no one is psychic here, so this can be difficult to enforce. How is anyone supposed to know if something is making someone else feel negative emotions? Well the only way I can think of is to listen to the person when they say that something is causing them to feel a certain way and figure out a solution. Presently the solution is to continue to make fun of them, in fact, even moreso because they are 'freaking out' or 'mad' or something, and we are talking as an out of character entity here.

No one should log onto a game that is supposed to be fun and be hit with a constant stream of other people's negative emotions. Some people may say I have been guilty of this in the past, or that this isn't actually a problem, or that people play at their own risk, etc. I think that this is a problem, and people shouldn't just have to play at their own risk, but they should be provided with a place that is relatively safe according to the policies. As for my own behavior in the past, it has been entirely in character, and I've actually gone out of my way to defend other people's out of character rights as players and people. 

It is my sincere hope that this post gets through to some people and the incredible amount of bullying and trolling on this game can be curbed a little bit. I am not saying there is no room for in charact
13:35 er fighting or beeating people up, but this constant, unrelenting mob mentality where when any one person is weak and getting picked on everyone jumps in to take a dig to make themselves feel better - it needs to stop.


Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Regards,
Patrick

you've been so guilty of this, not to mention something happens in game you don't like, you start on the person oocly. and you've done the exact same to people that is now being done to you. so if you can't take the heat. get out of the kitchen.

Actually that is not true, Cara, anything 'OOCly' I have said to anyone has been only a reply to an OOC comment. You are doing the exact thing I am saying in my post and listening to other people in the mob because this is just repeating something someone else said to me.

This post isn't even about me, I have taken care of what is 'now being done' to me. Although thanks for confirming that there is something going on and that this is an issue. Its funny that someone who has been severely bullied like you would speak out against this post, but that just goes to show how compartmentalized people are into thinking if they agree with the status quo they will be safe.

This isn't a personal problem, it is a problem that EVERYONE is facing. Please don't bother insulting me further, thanks.

Regards,
Patrick

You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet.

15:26 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels return to their previous positions along the hull.

15:26 You begin the landing sequence.

15:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, a compact silver Lore computer, and a pair of brown leather tennis shoes here.
