01:42 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Amalthea; Landing Pad.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, and a dark blue suede sofa here.
You can go south and out.

You can go south and out.

01:50 You peer out and see...

01:50 [Amalthea; Landing Pad]
Towering mountains surround and embrace the valley where this landing pad rests, their peaks invisible far above. Caves of all sizes cut into the mountains, some natural, others appearing to be man made or at least modified. The landing pad itself is little more than a flat area of gravel, carefully cleared out to provide a safe place for landing.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Scheherazade" powered down here.
You see the three-person heliogaster "Galactic Rainbow" landed here.
You see a white claw machine encrusted with crystalline mineral deposits, Atheist the droid, and a sapphire blue stuffed manatee here.

01:59 The ship needs to be powered before you can do that.

01:59 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:59 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

01:59 The computer announces, "There is no repair in progress."

01:59 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

02:11 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:11 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:11 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:11 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:11 Sector 2: Ono (The Hale Collective)

02:11 Galactic Coordinates: (-603079, 0, 420)

02:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:11 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:11 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:11 The computer announces, "A starship and a space station have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:11 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:11 Invalid selection.

02:11 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:11 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:11 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

02:12 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:12 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

02:18 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:18 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

02:18 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:18 [Private | Miriam Valleris] Miriam Valleris transmits, "hi hi"

02:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:18 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:18 Invalid selection.

02:18 The three-person voyager "Antepasto" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

02:18 The ship is already moving.

02:18 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:18 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:18 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:18 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:18 The computer announces, "Two planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

02:18 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:18 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 5, 9, 5."

02:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:19 The starship is already moving.

02:19 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:19 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:19 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:19 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "How are you doing?"

02:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

02:19 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:19 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

03:18 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

03:26 You say, "combat"

18:30 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You can go south, down, and out.

18:31 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 7, 3."

18:31 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:31 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:32 You begin the landing sequence.

18:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:32 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:32 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

18:32 You must stand up first.

18:32 You must stand up first.

18:32 You can't go that way.

18:32 You must stand up first.

18:32 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a gray armor storage bag, and an asteroid hauling kit.

18:32 You are carrying a droid remote titled "Rolukssica" in your right hand.

18:32 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at 51 Pegasi b; Balloonzia Circle Landing Pad.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You can go south, down, and out.

This cozy, elegantly furnished living room has highly polished hardwood floors. The walls are drywall and painted a sky-blue. A ceiling fan in the shape of a majestic eagle hangs from the ceiling. Its wide wingspan causes a gentle breeze to flow throughout the room as the blades spins hypnotically. A tall zigzagged glass warm midnight blue lamp is casting a warm antique white light throughout the room. You see a black mahogany square-shaped wall clock and a life-sized painting in a gold frame hanging on the wall.
You see a large marble fireplace with a rosewood hearth and a rosewood mantel, a polished cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfortable ice white leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, two glass end tables, a tall zigzagged glass warm midnight blue lamp, a cherry wood trash bin, a midnight blue suede recliner, a glass coffee table with short spiraling white marble legs carved with leaves, a red beanbag chair, a large red Persian rug, and Kayla's food cart here.
