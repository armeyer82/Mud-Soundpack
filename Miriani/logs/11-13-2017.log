02:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:28 You're already buckled in.

02:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:28 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:28 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

02:28 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:28 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

02:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

02:28 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.
You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:26 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:26 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:26 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:26 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:26 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:26 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:33 You peer out and see...

12:33 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

12:33 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

13:05 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Kelen; Landing Pad.
You can go south and out.

14:07 ["Acrylon Courier Transport 6938" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

The combined color themes of the four main avenues leading off this vast central chamber come together here in an enormous spiral of deep turquoise, orange, golden brown, and black tiles. They spiral in ever smaller circles in towards the very middle of the space where a large decoratively carved metal staircase curves up to the top level. Massive steel beams set between the eight grand archways leading off into the floating concourse support the weight of the two upper levels. On this lowest level, with no natural light from the clouds to illuminate the area, long tubes of bright white light have been fitted into the ceiling. Tall statues formed out of gleaming silver and bronze metal have been placed artfully throughout this central plaza, each of them posed in a gesture towards the street of their namesake.

14:13 [Venus; Concourse Beta; Suborbital Pod Station] (indoors)
This large domed suborbital pod station is carpeted in a thin burgundy rug. The arched ceiling and curved walls are made of an incredibly thick glass-like material. Beyond them swirl the lethal yellow and orange clouds of the planet which appear to be streaming past at an incredibly fast speed. Wooden benches with padded cushions are scattered throughout the room, and at its center stands a menu terminal where transport pods to the other concourses may be ordered for a set fee. A glassed in tube extends through the ceiling with some sort of hatch sealing it off from the skies outside. A steady stream of airtight pods arrives and departs from it in short bursts of activity, with passengers exiting the airlock tube via a small latched door.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Venus; Concourse Alpha; Landing Zone and Level 1 Center.

Pale golden tiles resembling sand span the length of this long corridor. Along its southern side, an ocean has been painted in intricate detail rolling out towards the horizon beneath a pale blue sky. The light from the churning yellowish orange clouds coming in through the glassed-in ceiling plays upon the metallic flecks in the ocean mural, making it appear to be shifting slightly. Along the north side of the avenue is a sheer rocky wall in which a large cave has been cut. The enormous Cyclopes Polyphemus stands guard at its entrance with a large rock held high above his one-eyed head. The sound of the ocean is being piped in through hidden speakers, and a crowd of people reading a small informational plaque takes up most of the walking space.

14:51 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "And you?"

14:51 I don't understand that.

14:51 You don't see that here.

14:51 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:52 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

14:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:52 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."
You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

14:52 The ship is already moving.

14:52 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:52 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:52 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:52 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:52 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

14:52 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:52 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

14:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:52 The starship is already moving.

14:52 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:52 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

14:52 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:52 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

14:52 You can't power down the starship in space.

14:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

14:52 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

14:52 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:52 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

14:52 You must stand up first.

14:52 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

14:53 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

14:56 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

14:58 You're already sitting down.

14:58 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

14:58 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:58 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

14:58 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:58 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

14:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:58 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

14:58 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:58 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:58 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:58 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:58 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

14:58 The ship must be in space to do that.

14:58 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:58 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:58 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 14, 8, 3."

14:58 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:58 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:59 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:59 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:59 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:59 You must stand up first.

14:59 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

This large domed suborbital pod station is carpeted in a thin burgundy rug. The arched ceiling and curved walls are made of an incredibly thick glass-like material. Beyond them swirl the lethal yellow and orange clouds of the planet which appear to be streaming past at an incredibly fast speed. Wooden benches with padded cushions are scattered throughout the room, and at its center stands a menu terminal where transport pods to the other concourses may be ordered for a set fee. A glassed in tube extends through the ceiling with some sort of hatch sealing it off from the skies outside. A steady stream of airtight pods arrives and departs from it in short bursts of activity, with passengers exiting the airlock tube via a small latched door.

Dozens of white plastic tables are scattered around this noisy restaurant, with most of them being booths set along the back wall. Bright orange and yellow chairs offset the pale yellow tiles which, upon closer inspection, appear to be dotted with tiny pictures of the various kinds of food served here. A menu board hangs alongside a flat vid screen upon the pale orange back wall, and each of the tables has its own built in system for ordering. Tiny server drones rush around delivering food to customers, and their quiet hum, combined with the cartoon blaring from the vid screen, drowns out the upbeat music playing in the background.

15:08 You are thrown back against your seat as the craft hits an air pocket in the atmosphere and then breaks free.

15:08 There are no obvious commands at your current location.

15:08 The pod's suicidal pace  slows as it reaches the next concourse, gently touching down. The doors open and you disembark.

You can go south and out.

15:08 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:08 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

15:09 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

15:09 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

15:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:09 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

15:09 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:09 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

15:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:09 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:09 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:09 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

15:09 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:09 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:09 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

15:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

15:09 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

15:09 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:09 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:09 You must stand up first.

15:09 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

15:09 You must stand up first.

15:15 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:25 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

15:42 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" landed here.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit the droid, Rar the droid, Acer the droid, Kaitlyn the droid, Nala the droid, Zia the droid, Hector the droid, Morison the droid, Meow the d
15:42 roid, Kangaroo the droid, Hadron the droid, and Criosh the droid here.
You can go northeast, south, west, up, and down.

15:42 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:42 You're already sitting down.

15:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

15:42 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

15:42 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Planets: (4, 4, 7)
Moons: (5, 3, 7)
Space Stations: (15, 6, 4), (10, 14, 9), (9, 13, 9), (10, 13, 9), (11, 13, 9), and (10, 12, 9)
Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (10, 11, 9)

15:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:42 You're already buckled in.

15:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:42 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:42 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

15:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:43 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:43 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:45 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:07 You peer out and see...

17:07 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

21:08 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

21:11 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

21:11 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

21:11 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

21:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:11 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

21:11 You're already sitting down.

21:11 The ship is already moving.

21:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:11 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:11 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:11 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

21:11 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:11 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

21:11 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:11 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:12 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:12 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

21:12 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Full bay in a sec."

21:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

21:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

21:12 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

21:12 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:12 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

21:20 ["Magical Melody" Weapons Room 4] (indoors) (sitting on a soft royal purple velvet combat chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a soft royal purple velvet combat chair, an internal stun turret, and a jelly-filled blue beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest.

21:20 Calyssa Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ooo yum"

21:20 Aaron Blade's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "with bacon"

21:20 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:20 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

21:20 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:20 Alayna Wells's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "hmmm"

21:20 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:20 Beatrice Carmichael's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "that does sound splendid"

21:20 Aaron Blade's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "right?"

21:20 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

21:20 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:20 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:20 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I can never gun and eat at the same time."

21:20 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:20 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:20 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:20 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:20 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:20 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.
You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

21:20 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:20 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

22:10 ["Magical Melody" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. You see a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset and a twinkling strand of blue lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

22:23 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

22:23 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:23 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Ooey Gooey Butter Cake You're So Addictive", the ten-person battlecruiser "Incredulous Incredibility", the eight-person gunship "Blue Star", the one-person expediter "Hurtling Through The Void", and the three-person freighter "Flying By The Seat of My Pants" landed here.

22:24 You put a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in a black leather briefcase.

22:24 You remove a droid remote titled "acrylon" from a black leather briefcase.

22:24 You gently slide a droid remote titled "acrylon" into a slot on the side of a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. With a soft click, the remote snaps into place and the screen is filled with a live broadcast of Observation Center.

23:09 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

23:19 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:19 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

23:19 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:19 You're already sitting down.

23:19 You're already buckled in.

23:19 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:19 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Acrylon.

23:19 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:19 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:19 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:19 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:19 > (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

23:19 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:19 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:20 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

23:20 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:20 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:20 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:20 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:20 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

23:21 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:21 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:21 You must stand up first.

23:21 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

23:21 You stand up.

23:22 [Miriani Garage] (indoors)
This magnificent multi-level garage echoes with the sound of voices mingled with the electronic whirring of the hundreds of robotic arms transporting starships to and from the landing pad above. The curved walls of the structure have built in metal recharging platforms large enough to fit several starships at a time. Bright white lights affixed to the steel beams crossing the ceiling cast an unrelieved illumination over the hundreds of service drones darting between the powered down ships. At the far southern end of the garage is a lighted stairway which leads down.

You can go down and out.

23:23 You need a free hand for that.

23:23 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black stun armor storage bag, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a red leather artifact storage container, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a red spacesuit jet, a red archaeological artifact storage container, and a level five archaeological dig site scanner.
