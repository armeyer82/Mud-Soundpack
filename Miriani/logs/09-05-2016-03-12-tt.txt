Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life
and coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, an engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst
butterflies, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a red nylon
mesh shopping bag, an insulated green cooler, Magellan the arachnoid security
robot, and Xavier the big silver soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

blackness and finally regular space.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls

glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

"Hmm, well, that message makes sense." Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her
face as she ponders. "If you imagine the torus as a central point and the ndb
signals like a ball around it consisting of layers, a bit like how an onion has
rings. So if you move on a heading that is still equally far from the torus,
you're not getting closer to home but the signal stays the same."

one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life
and coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, an engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst
butterflies, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a red nylon
mesh shopping bag, an insulated green cooler, and Magellan the arachnoid
security robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch. Kim Saunders is
standing here.
You can go south and out.

   This is not actually something that you can actually do with the rift
drive!
   Before you throw this manual in frustration, realize that all hope is
not lost, at least over relatively short distances. You will need a
friend and two hyperwave broadcasters. One will serve as the calibrator,
and one will be the responder. First, turn the power low and aim the
hyperwave broadcasters at each other. As soon as the communications are
clear, the responder will stop increasing power. However, the calibrator
will continue increasing power. The responder's job is to notify the
calibrator when the signal quality begins to degrade. Since you already
know that the range is sufficient, that means that the heading is
incorrect. Make progressive adjustments and even decrease the power
slightly until you get a clear signal. Do not increase the transmission
power until the signal is perfect again. Repeat the process until you
are either satisfied with the heading, or the calibrator is at maximum
power. Done properly, this will give you an extremely accurate (within a
few fractions of a degree at maximum calibration) heading to your
destination, although the method is very tedious. Thankfully, the
hyperwave broadcaster calibration upgrade assists matters greatly, since
you will not have to rely on listening carefully for bursts of static to
appear in the transmissions.

rift heading
Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).

rift heading
Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).
Invalid heading.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life
and coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, an engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst
butterflies, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a red nylon
