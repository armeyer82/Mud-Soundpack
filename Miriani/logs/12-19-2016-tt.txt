Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

sweetheart neckline, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red
'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of white platform shoes.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light
purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria

This cheerful establishment is decorated like an old-fashioned neighborhood bar.
Small square wooden tables with padded red stools pulled up around them are
randomly arranged across the floor, which is laid with faux wooden planks. Small
colored lights shine over the scarred wooden counter at the back of the bar, and
the walls are decorated with murals of wintry scenes where herds of brown and
white caribou cross the wind-swept snow. The kitchen behind the bar is little
more than several grills, a deep fat frier, a chopping block, and a
refrigerator.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

feed them now, and she looked after mine for ages."

string of yes men."

shit."

actually apply."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I figured I could just break in
and stay."

aproved by the head guy, Kringle."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm well fucked then, he
leaves me in space all the time, well, once, but all the time."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That was entirely on accident."

messing around."

it afterwards."

feature..."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Did the bari make an
appearance?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That was a separate dream..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That one was actualy
reminiscent of a riftstorm dream...and featured that courier ship from early
this morning."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Which courier ship?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think I located the source
of the numerous pods in Campeche early this morning."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There was an abandoned courier
ship down there. I'd seen it around a couple times, even seen it jump out of
Campeche so never thought much about it...except for when I tried to chase it
once and couldn't. Anyway, it was overwhelmed with bari. When it was uhm...taken
down, hull was at 98% and everything else was 98 to 100%."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Today you saw this?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, that control room was
a mess. Early, early this morning."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You by yourself?"

[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Interesting."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, now I will institute a
habit of scanning courier ships."

then you just followed it for fun?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I wunder who's it was."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No, I tried to follow it a
couple days ago but it wouldn't show on my tracer and I didn't think much about
it. I had other things to do."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I told him to tug it to a
gamma sector so we could check it out better."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, the control room
was...a nightmare."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Okay... Sounds about as good as
I'm going to get."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mold, vines, warrior, mature
and larval hordes, and a tremendously loarge queen."

[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's hot."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Nasty stuff."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew coughs. "Large..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So yeah, I dreamed the thing
took off with me in it."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not sure the felo
would have got it with one charge boost."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I doubt all that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It would have needed
atmosphere anyway."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "In deed."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Could have got that on a
temp station."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Would have had to land it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "True."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "But not all temp stations
recharge a ship."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But I doubt my felo would have
made it against that queen."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So, the course of action
was sound."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Enough of them and it would've
worked."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I made it out with bruises,
luckily."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Could you have just blown it
up?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, but it would have taken
my whole ship. As it is, a couple of mine got taken out in the infestation on y
own ship."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Still kaboomski fixes
everything."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what I did, Erik."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ah."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only took 4 shots from my
lasers."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Nice."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If we didn't get the
bosters up in time, ship would have died again thus killing all the felo. I
don't think we have a temp station that recharges close by?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, and I had those EAOS
things on there, not the super heavy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Nope."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Closest would have been
through the rift...and thinking back that I'd seen that ship move uh...under its
own power...no..."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How do bari even fly our
ships."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I had charge boosters on me,
probably 4 or 5 of them, but still."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is what I'm curius about."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wanted off that ship when
they were oxidizing the thing as I stood on it."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They work as one."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Still, knowing how to operate a
starship? Doesn't that require some intelegence? I thought they had none of
that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't think that they 'know'
in the sense that we do."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They're intelligent enough."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They don't operate the systems
goof. They take everything over kinda like RATS."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I should have figured it was
something like that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a biological...the best
word I can think of is interfacing...they don't tell the flight computer where
to go using their little brains."

to wait."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Please send preorders via

[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "So that's order by phone,
right?"

dumb face."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "His face doesn't open with his
mouth though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno...I keep it up, Ather
might open it for me..."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am contemplating doing
that..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew gasps.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now leave me alone."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm...but if I leave you
alone, I cannot purchase your crafting services."

I will get back to you as soon as I can scrounge them."

I have."
