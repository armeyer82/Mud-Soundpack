Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;

You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large

Shule, I have been trying for most of my waking cycle to compose a response to
you. I'm so sad and defistated over this. I'm so sorry for the breakdown in
communications but I so want for us to make an attempt to work through this. I
really don't feel that you are being fair to cut me off unless ... you really
never cared after all. With your cold attitude towards me, I suppose this may be
so.I would like though for you to ask yourself a question? Is A party whereby we
both acted a bit more open than we would worth ending what was at least the
beginning of a good friendship at least? How is it that I'm not worthy of your
time all of a sudden? What in the stars have I done which is so wrong when I
have personally tried hard to accomodate you and to help you? I am free this
morning but around 1800 I will need to nap for a few hours. - Lily

Tatiana Krupin,
Noting your recent request for Starchart notation instruction, I seriously doubt
that any of the esteemed pilots who possess expert skills with Starchart
notation skills will give you the time of day. You were amongst the brightest
and most skilled in Starchart notation of civilian pilots aboard the Metal Heart
crew. You were extremely disrespectful and furthermore have gone out of your way
to exagerate your experiences with them in the most negative manner. You have,
through your verbal and other behavior, demonstrated that you have no respect
for more experienced pilots than As Sakura stated, you are promoting character
assassination and could care less concerning their well-being. You abjectly do
not comprehend that building positive relationships with others and particularly
with those who are in the position to impart institutional knowledge to you to
helpp you develop your skills is key to gaining rank as well as respect amongst
the pilot corps.
Regarding your claim that I screamed quarantine in your ear? I did nothing of
the sort. I 'screamed' absolutely nothing. The unfortunate thing I did do was
initially become caught-up in your grandiose drama. After consideration of what
you presented I did encourage you to report which is what everyone should do.
However, there were too many emotionally-charged statements made by you. I was
in full agreement with Shule Elemmire, AEU Voice of the Corps. I am certain that
others will validate what I said and did not say as well.
Given these recent events involving yourself, although I am planning an
expedition in the near future, I have no intentions of inviting you because I
simply will not put up with your disruptive behavior and neither will others for
that matter. You have a tremendous bit of work on your part to do regarding your
behavior and attitude. Perhaps if you show enough improvement, others may begin
to regard you more favorably. While I admire tenacity, disregard for others and
a blatant attitude of disrespect for others as well as your childish revenge
schemes and antagonism towards those most regarded will afford you absolutely
nothing in return.
Last, I offer you one more bit of advice which is to ceas with disgracing the
AEU and to resign your liaison post as Industrial Whip.

Shule,
I know Tatiana Krupin will seek you out now after our last two exchanges. I am
copying in my final post to her below. Although I won't go out of my way to
approach her, one aspect that she needs to accept is that she is not permitted
to silence our outrage. If she can speak out, so should we be able to. I also
wasn't harrassing her but applying peer pressure but it's without a doubt that
she is beyond reason. I know too that you must be careful in your own approach
with Krupin but as a peer, I can certainly express what I want and I have. If I
were in your position, for professional reasons, I certainly would have to
phrase differently. If you do ask her to resign it should likely be moreso that
you remind her of our positions as holding a leadership role and how her own
conduct is also scrutinized by other alliances and that our respective behavior
can and will affect diplomatic relations. Of course this is up to you and you
know exactly how to word it. If I wer her though, I'd much prefer to resign than
to have the whole of AEU civilian pilots voting against me. This obviously
doesn't phase her though. It's very surreal that reality simply does not
register with this woman.
This is my very last post to Krupin -
Tatiana Krupin, I daresay that you have far more to deal with concerning your
own reputation and behavior than I ever will. The reason why I disliked you
early on was for behavior and arrogance exactly like what you just exonerated
through your recent actions. I am a reasonable person and if, for a moment, I
felt that your case was valid, I would be supportive and this would be
regardless of my own opinion of you. i believe in justice and your attempts to
effect unfounded injustice towards our own who have endured far more than you
could ever imagine, worked hardest for us, discovered wonders and are the very
core of our Core vallue. You are truly a poor excuse for a human being and for
your dishonorable abuse. You will indeed pay for your offenses against civilian
pilots. I promise to be there to cheer on the judges. I shall speak to you
whenever I so desire as well. You cannot silence me nor can anyone. I'll likely
not waste my time with writing to you further however as you are beyond
worthwhile of my time and effort.

To Voice of the Corps Lily Kaise,
These, as best as I can piece together, are the events concerning the 12:00 30
April report given to SDC Shule elemmire.
For reasons still unknown, a League cadet by the name of Raymond (I don't have a
last name at this time) attacked Simon Collins, a League pilot, over New Earth.
SDC Elemmire's report shows a League flitter by the name of "Star Flyer" firing
the first shots on a League light transport "Transporting." Several League
pilots have confirmed that "Transporting" belongs to Mr. Collins, and based on
an account given to me by Akemi Bando, I can safely assume that the flitter
belongs to Raymond.
After "Transporting" was attacked, Collins called out over comms that he was
being attacked and sent out a distress call, which alerted the League pilots of
his ship's location. According to hearsay, Ms. Bando urged Raymond to cease his
attacking due to the threat of the AEU navy getting involved. There has, as of
right now, not been any mention of Collins returning fire, but the AEU SDC
report clearly shows shots being fired on the flitter by the transport, as well
as a single shot being fired by the Fringe mule "Masterson" belonging to
Nathaniel Owens. Ms. Bando says that to her, it sounded like "Masterson" may
have also been attacked, but this is unconfirmed.
At this point, after shots have been exchanged, the pilots in question land on
New Earth where they exit their ships. First reports of the incident mention a
physical fight of some sort, but Ms. Bando goes a step further and says that
Raymond attacks Mr. Collins, then AEU pilot Kim Saunders shows up to help
Collins and Owens subdue Raymond. Apparently this fight tires Raymond out, and
the others clean themselves up and return to their business. Ms. Bando mentions
that she was salvaging at the time, and in the rift for the end of this, so her
comms were garbled. I will be interviewing Mr. Collins sometime in the near
future, and will invite yourself and SDC Elemmire to attend if you are inclined.
Below, I have copied Ms. Bando's accounting of events as she sent them. I hope
this information is of use to you, and helps to clarify this situation.
The accounting of the Raymond situation by Akemi Bando:
Dear SDC Hudson,
I was out at the 134th picking through wrecks when I heard Simon and Nathaniel
call out over the tactical channel that they were being attacked over New Earth
by a League flitter. I checked the list of active communicators and saw that
Raymond, a cadet, was active. I asked them to scan the flitter and see if it was
showing a cadet tag. They report it was, so I advised them to not escalate and
instead disengage from what I assumed was simply a confused cadet.
They did so, but Raymond pursued them until they landed. Apparently once they
landed, Raymond also landed and exited his ship. Reportedly, he used physical
violence (punching, kicking, etc) against Simon. Kim turned up at that point and
I believe she helped Simon and Nathanial subdue Raymond, but as I was enroute
between the 134th and B-24 I can't be sure.
Raymond apparently tired out and they were able to release him and go back to
their business. By the time I returned to beaconed space, everything was done.

We have a couple of options or to do both:
Go to GMG
Or
go to Hall of Pain as shown below to artifact for Alien Artifacts as there's
perhaps a week to ten days left on the stations along the way which I imagine
are up for recharging purposes.
I have time available through Monday but Tuesday I'll not be working much except
that i'll be around on a limited basis until about 1500 to 1600. Tuesday would
be an ok day for traveling in the rift to or from Hall of pain provided you're
comfortable with flying solo. i'd be around later on Tuesday between 0200 and
0400.
So we can go to GMG and then head for Hall of Pain sometime this weekend or so
or go straight out to Hall of Pain and do GMG befor Tuesday or later next week?
Here is the Hall of Pain info --
Heading to Hall of Pain
100 Light-Years at a heading of 270 -2. Then 150 or so Light-Years 270, 0"
Total travel distance is about 250 Light-Years or just a little more than 32
Light-Trade Cycles.

Hello Takana and shule, I am concerned about how you both were treated by Joel
Kringle today. If this was a practical joke, it's ok and I hope both of you are
the better for it. If it wasn't, then please take any concerns such as these to
our Voice of the Corps, Annie Lynn. While she can't force other pilots to treat
you fairly, at least she is there to talk to and through her leadership,
encouraging some level of fair treatment amongst pilots would be in order. Pilot
life isn't the easiest. There will always be those who will are rude and treat
more vulnerable pilots unreasonably. For you both, please don't let your guard
down ever and be careful concerning what you say to other pilots, particularly
to those who are not in our alliance and what you ask of them. Hang in there! -

Hello Shule my sweetie,
I see you are sleeping and I don't know if you'll get this message but I wanted
to let you know I am taking my cargo hauler over to space vermin patrol and am
going to do some missions to try to earn some money and points. I would like to
buy a couple more things for our special ship. After that if I'm not exhausted I
might go over to tesla and do some work over there. If you wake up and you get
this, give me a call and maybe we can do tesla together.

Hi baby,
Well, Takana did get in touch with me, and I did tell her that you wanted us to
hang out here on praying Mantis, but she wanted to check on her felo. I agreed
and I thought she understood that after we checked on her felo, we would come
back here. Instead, she showed me around her fortress and then we ended up
sitting on a fur in her observation room and talking. Nothing naughty happened.
There was some light snuggling and a couple kisses, and she did take off her
minidress but I did not. We ended up on old earth where she helped some people
with their space station. She asked me to please hold her until she fell asleep,
so I did. I found out who Nix was, and I told her a bit of my life story. You
are right, she really isn't that bad and she's had a very difficult life. I'm
back here on praying mantis but I may fly up to Lidia's Pride just because that
bed is so much more comfortable. I should be sleeping soon. Please don't be mad
at me for hanging out on Takana's ship instead of our ship. She told me I could
blame her if I wanted to. I care about you even more than I did before you went
to sleep and I miss you a bunch.

Hello my darling
I have nothing important to report to you about my goings on after you slept. I
did not take kalliste back to Jupiter and scoop. Instead I laid right here and
dozed beside you, snuggled up to you safe and warm. At some point I had a
conversation with Kim on the communicator, on the alliance channel, about what a
great day I had. Naturally she asked who this very special person was I
mentioned, and since we both know and trust her, I mentioned your name. I told
her you took me to the sims and taught me lock evasion which I'd never learned
before. She apologized that I'd never learned it before but told me what a great
student you were in response to my telling her what a great teacher you were.
She told me she was very very happy for me, and then the communicator was quiet
for a while after that. Rats nests ended up being offered a few minutes ago, but
somehow my battlesuit is on Hyperion and I wasn't sure how to get it back
without people seeing me on your mule. Plus, exhaustion has finally set in and I
think I'm going to sleep now for real, not just doze, but actually crash for a
while.
I did want to tell you that my availability is going to be scarce for today. I
may be around a little bit for a couple hours around ten pm or eleven, but then
will have to sleep again for a few hours and will return in the early morning
hours as usual. I will definitely miss you and dream of you while I'm sleeping.
So with all that out of the way, I'm going to curl up and sleep now. I love you.
I'm so glad we had such an awesome day together. Have a great day until I see
you again.
Love
Your Rebekah

Hello Shule my love,
I have to sleep in less than 10 minutes, so since the time is running so short,
I think I'm just going to flop down on our living room rug and sleep for a
while. I do not know if I will be awake at my normal time in the morning or not
because there is something that might pull me away from piloting duties
unfortunately, but we will see. I don't know if you read the boards or not, but
on the AEU debate board there is a post from the liaison office telling us who
our new officers are and a poist from Nils introducing herself and explaining
why she wanted to be the voice of the corps. All of our officers stay the same,
it would appear, since no one opposed any of them so there was no voting this
term as I understand it.
Remember, I love you and am thinking of you even when I'm sleeping. I hope that
if I don't see you again at my usual time that you have a wonderful day and keep
making those points so you can create the coolest org ever. If I do happen to
wake up I will give you a call.
All my love,
Bekah

Hello dearest,
While you were dozing, I ran back to the org center and made some changes to my
contribution levels so that we could hopefully make some progress. I changed my
point contribution level to 5.0 percent and changed my credit contribution to 30
percent. I hope that is enough for now because I really need my points and
credits so I can buy more ships and things. I also contributed some of my own
credits to our org fund. Finally, I exchanged a bunch of my eaos credits into
aeu credits so I can buy my own passenger transport ship. That's something I
haven't done yet and I've been wanting to.
I'm about to go to sleep now, but I love you and will see you when I wake up.
Love

Hi baby,
I will be asleep by the time you come home. I donned my beach towel and ran
through the spaceport to send you this letter because I wouldn't be awake to
give it to you. I sure hope space port security doesn't arrest me.
Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for my negativity. I knew my first birthday
away from mom and dad and especially mark would be really difficult. I really
should have just stayed at 469. That way I wouldn't have missed you quite so
much and wouldn't have been so whiny. I'm really sorry. I guess that it's safe
to say that I'm a human being and sometimes I have feelings and sometimes those
feelings are sad or angry or whatever. I can't be happy and upbeat every single
day, because I'm not a robot or an android or a computer. I'm a living breathing
girl and sometimes I have issues. Still, I'm really really sorry for sounding so
negative on comms today. I really do like my birthday cake and it brought the
biggest smile to my face. Besides that it was chocolate, just like I asked for.
So thank you a million times over for that. I should be back to normal after I
wake up again.
I'm going to send this and run back home before security catches me wandering
the spaceport in a towel. At least it covers all my naughty bits. I love you.
Don't ever forget that. You make every day special. Every day that I'm with you
is a day I can be thankful for. Even today. I know you take your work very
seriously as do I. So I don't want you to think I'm mad at you because I'm
really not.
Love forever
Rebekah

My dearest, my love,
I just wanted to check in with you and let you know I would not be sleeping at
the apartment when I go to bed in about an hour. Because of multiple planet side
distractions, I made it all the way to fleet omega 469 but didn't haul in one
single asteroid. I'm feeling a little bit down and discouraged by this as I had
plenty of time to haul plenty of asteroids, but didn't haul in anything and made
no money. So I flew back to Coreward and I jumped across the skims to Helios,
went to their little weightless mall thingie, bought me a new hairstyle and a
tube of stuff I'm hoping will make my hair grow faster so you can play with it,
and then I went all the way to the top and bought a foam air bed and a sheet,
pillow, and blanket to make my asteroid hauler really comfy. I should have
bought a foot locker, they had them there, but I didn't. What I plan to do is
before I go to sleep for the day is fly back out to 469, maybe haul in one
asteroid, then go on to sleep powered down at that station. This way I can wake
up already there and immediately start hauling asteroids. Of course, if you want
me to come home and see you, or if you want to fly out there, I'd be glad to let
that happen. I'm just feeling very unproductive and am trying to make up for it.
I hope you like my new hair. I think it's very plain and simple, but sometimes I
like plain and simple.
I love you and I'm going to send this off now and get flying. The sooner I make
it through the rift the sooner I can bring in an asteroid. I don't have that
long before I have to sleep. I love you more than anything and I miss you. I
hope you're sleeping well. Talk to you soon.
Love always,
Rebekah

My dearest and most beloved,
At long last I find myself about to go to sleep beside you in the same bed.
Seems like I've been sleeping anywhere but home for the past bit but tonight I
am home and I am in bed beside you. I just wanted to really quickly update you
on my day before I go to sleep.
I did fly to demargas and purchased a mount and a scoop. I bought the clunker
although I could have with my points and credits afforded a higher grade scoop.
Its focus was on capacity, and I decided I'd stick with the clunker for just a
little bit. Another thing I did was had my hair done again. I decided that the
way I had my hair was just too plain and boring. I also decided I really like my
hair in ringlets or curls. So, once again I've changed my hair and now it is in
a bunch of delicate little ringlets. I like this and will stick with it for a
while I think.
A sad thing I wanted to tell you about was that I had to take two of my felo to
the sanctuary today. Not because they were mean, they were very sweet. But they
had something wrong with them. I believe they were visually impaired. One of
them had eyes that looked just fine, but he kept meowing at the food trough
after I'd already filled it. He also kept stumbling around from room to room. I
thought he was the only one so I took him to the sanctuary, then I dozed for a
little while in my ship on hyperion. And while I was dozing, I realized that I
had another felo that was also stumbling around but he actually had crossed
eyes. So, since I was still landed at Hyperion, I carried him to the sanctuary
too. I donated some of my own credits to the sanctuary both times I left felo
there to help with the cost of caring for them both.
Now I'm ready to go on to sleep. I have taken a couple naps but it's been a kind
of long day. I've got a few plans for when I wake up next, such as going to the
spaceport ship shop and seeing if my points will allow me to upgrade my grappler
again. Somehow I doubt this, but it never hurts to check. I would love to fly
out to 469 again, but I may decide to just stay home for a couple of days and do
tesla, or do SVP missions, or whatever else I feel like doing, like asteroid
mining. I haven't done that in forever and I'm sure I'd do really well with it
now.
That's quite enough babbling from me right now. I love you more than anything in
the galaxy and I hope you're sleeping well. I shall now join you in the land of
nod.
love

If the glyph at the door flashes black, we cancel it. If white, we match it. So
if we get a red one, it'll flash black, flash a blue and a yellow. If we get an
indigo that flashes white, we first make a violet glyph, then a blue one. If
that indigo flashes black, we cancel it by making a saffron glyph (make an
orange glyph, then add yellow).

Note - there may be some mistakes in spelling, etc here but I found these notes
concerning Ifs.
Target priority for IFS beacons or invasions
For IFS, you basically want to take out the heavy hitters first.
Almost all of them are able to constantly hit you, and the quicker
you can reduce the rate of damage you're taking the better off
you will be
1. Hades. These just fire constantly and do a lot of damage.
2. Poseidons. Not as bad as Hades, but pretty bad.
3. Artemises. Basic long range attackers, they'll hit you
steadily but not very quickly.
4. Ares. Like Artemises but they can't take a hit.
5. Apollos. No long range attacks. Save them for last.
a few special notes --
Hestia - If you see one of these and you're not in a cruiser...
you should probably leave it to someone who is. They hit very
very hard and they can launch fighters.
Chronos - A very dangerous IFS flagship. Avoid unless you're a
very good pilot. Very good pilot is an understatement these are wicked to deal
with and you will likely lose.
Deployment Apollos - These are about to drop a forward assault station.
But you have some time to take them out before they do. If you see
one of these jump in and you're nearby, drop your current target and
go after it.
This may be the Ifs that looks like a carrier.
Researchers weren't noted but I am pretty sure they would be targeted after the
Poseidons and Ares are destroyed. I'm pretty sure you will see Researchers
mostly on a Beacon or you will see an Ares and a Researcher show up sometimes. I
need to ask Ather.
Interdiction does occur and I thought it was the carrier class but when that
Chronos jumped in on Blake's beacon that time we were interdicted. I was too
busy to check all of the ships and since I was engineering, I couldn't access
other details.

Shule, Just in case I fall asleep and am not awake by the time we're supposed to
leave, please can you do the following? If you don't see the aquariums still
sitting around in William Dove, put them all on a hoverpallet and take them with
you? Also, the little pink bed is on a hoverpallet in the airlock of William
Dove, please put it on your hoverpallet and take it with you? Also, all five pet
felo are still in william Dove. Please ask Nissi if it's ok to put them aboard
her Imperator as I do have food bowls for them and please keep those two bags of
chow which I asked you to buy for them. I hope I will have managed to get the
food together. If not, we'll have some day old pizzas and things and there is a
vending machine which has food aboard the Imperator which is the same as the
Galleon so we won't starve! I'll have Asteria with me. There's just a situation
which may cause me to have to sleep unexpectedly. If I'm awake, I'll have taken
care of all of these things. I just want to be sure that the fish aquariums
which comprise yours and mine are taken along with us. If Nissi doesn't want the
pets aboard, they will be fine in William dove for probably a few weeks as
there's 15 bowls for 5 felo so even if Purr isn't around to mind the bowls, they
will be fine. Also, Kim can put her pets in with mine in William dove if Nissi
says no pets. I will still need to get with you to put the two robots aboard
your ships. Again, hopefully I'll have taken care of everything. Just being
precautionary. Hugs! - Lily

To Voice of the Corps Lily Kaise,
These, as best as I can piece together, are the events concerning the 12:00 30
April report given to SDC Shule elemmire.
For reasons still unknown, a League cadet by the name of Raymond (I don't have a
last name at this time) attacked Simon Collins, a League pilot, over New Earth.
SDC Elemmire's report shows a League flitter by the name of "Star Flyer" firing
the first shots on a League light transport "Transporting." Several League
pilots have confirmed that "Transporting" belongs to Mr. Collins, and based on
an account given to me by Akemi Bando, I can safely assume that the flitter
belongs to Raymond.
After "Transporting" was attacked, Collins called out over comms that he was
being attacked and sent out a distress call, which alerted the League pilots of
his ship's location. According to hearsay, Ms. Bando urged Raymond to cease his
attacking due to the threat of the AEU navy getting involved. There has, as of
right now, not been any mention of Collins returning fire, but the AEU SDC
report clearly shows shots being fired on the flitter by the transport, as well
as a single shot being fired by the Fringe mule "Masterson" belonging to
Nathaniel Owens. Ms. Bando says that to her, it sounded like "Masterson" may
have also been attacked, but this is unconfirmed.
At this point, after shots have been exchanged, the pilots in question land on
New Earth where they exit their ships. First reports of the incident mention a
physical fight of some sort, but Ms. Bando goes a step further and says that
Raymond attacks Mr. Collins, then AEU pilot Kim Saunders shows up to help
Collins and Owens subdue Raymond. Apparently this fight tires Raymond out, and
the others clean themselves up and return to their business. Ms. Bando mentions
that she was salvaging at the time, and in the rift for the end of this, so her
comms were garbled. I will be interviewing Mr. Collins sometime in the near
future, and will invite yourself and SDC Elemmire to attend if you are inclined.
Below, I have copied Ms. Bando's accounting of events as she sent them. I hope
this information is of use to you, and helps to clarify this situation.
The accounting of the Raymond situation by Akemi Bando:
Dear SDC Hudson,
I was out at the 134th picking through wrecks when I heard Simon and Nathaniel
call out over the tactical channel that they were being attacked over New Earth
by a League flitter. I checked the list of active communicators and saw that
Raymond, a cadet, was active. I asked them to scan the flitter and see if it was
showing a cadet tag. They report it was, so I advised them to not escalate and
instead disengage from what I assumed was simply a confused cadet.
They did so, but Raymond pursued them until they landed. Apparently once they
landed, Raymond also landed and exited his ship. Reportedly, he used physical
violence (punching, kicking, etc) against Simon. Kim turned up at that point and
I believe she helped Simon and Nathanial subdue Raymond, but as I was enroute
between the 134th and B-24 I can't be sure.
Raymond apparently tired out and they were able to release him and go back to
their business. By the time I returned to beaconed space, everything was done.
-Akemi Bando
Please contact me with any further questions or concerns.
Thank you,
Lillian Hudson
Space Defense Captain of the League of Old Earth Democracies

We have a couple of options or to do both:
Go to GMG
Or
go to Hall of Pain as shown below to artifact for Alien Artifacts as there's
perhaps a week to ten days left on the stations along the way which I imagine
are up for recharging purposes.
I have time available through Monday but Tuesday I'll not be working much except
that i'll be around on a limited basis until about 1500 to 1600. Tuesday would
be an ok day for traveling in the rift to or from Hall of pain provided you're
comfortable with flying solo. i'd be around later on Tuesday between 0200 and
0400.
So we can go to GMG and then head for Hall of Pain sometime this weekend or so
or go straight out to Hall of Pain and do GMG befor Tuesday or later next week?
Here is the Hall of Pain info --
Heading to Hall of Pain
100 Light-Years at a heading of 270 -2. Then 150 or so Light-Years 270, 0"
Total travel distance is about 250 Light-Years or just a little more than 32

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off

A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center
of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with bulbous vines and green pods.
This is a thick conical stalk with thick bulbous vines and bulbous green pods.
The plant's primary color is silver with a sheen of deep purple, faintly
reflective, reminiscent of metal.
The plant has grown to fill its container.

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

of the buildings, their surroundings undergoing landscaping; others are still
merely brick shells in the middle of dirt lots. Nearly hidden behind several
tiers of scaffolding, a warehouse here is apparently open for business, judging
from the number of people going into it who aren't wearing hardhats. A very
small sign you can look at is beside the door.

Ancient office buildings dominate this block. Though many of them bear signs of
having fallen into disrepair in the past, in their worn and dirty brick facades
and crumbling ornamental designs, New Phoenix's businesses displaced by the war
have begun moving in, rejuvenating the entire area. New offices now occupy the
old buildings, and even though outward repairs have begun only slowly, the area
already has a bustling atmosphere. A leveled building has been replaced with a
small plaza. A small hair care shop has recently opened here.

awnings shade every doorway. Beneath a bright green awning on the first floor of
a stylishly renovated brick building here is Alonzo's Fresh Hair Design. Nearby
is a set of steps leading down below ground level. A small sign above the steps
reads simply Piercing Parlor.

Though not completely restored, the old office buildings along this part of
Japan Boulevard are already home to new businesses. Two new shops are directly
next to each other in the same building: 'Freneza,' which has in its front
windows displays of hosiery, belts, and odd-looking bracelets; and 'Studdedly,'
which occupies the corner of the building and advertises with hand-made signs
its low-priced stock of wrist bands and chokers. A number of glum and edgy
people seem to hang around these shops, their spiked hair and unique dress
setting them apart from the usual shoppers.

New Phoenix's shopping district begins here, at the edge of China Road. Shops
and stores thrive, though often with reduced inventories due to the interruption
in trade caused by the war. Carts and tented merchants line the sidewalks, and
people mill about, searching for the perfect buy. Off to one side is The Silk
Worm, a fashionable ladies' department store. You also see a Chinese buffet bar
called the Golden Dragon, on the other side of the street. You can barely make

the many reconstruction sites nearby, with few vehicles in sight. To the west,
Asian restaurants and thrift stores line China Road. To the east is the city's
Bay Beach. An entrance to Bay Park is also here on the southwest corner of the
intersection, and the entrance to Pengyou Homelife across from it. A few police
officers stand near their vehicles parked along the street, keeping an eye on
scattered groups of protesters at the intersection.

This newly renovated block of Japan Boulevard is home to numerous businesses,
including the imposing Keough Building with its sleek, freshly modernized
facade. As part of the revitalization of the business district, a new store has
opened here sporting an array of various styles and colors of makeup in its
gleaming display windows. Over the doorway is a glittery sign, reading:
'Beautify You.' Directly to the south, the once rubble-filled north end of
Soviet Trail is being cleared as New Phoenix's industry recovers from the
Outsider war and occupation, while Mexico Lane to the southeast is as vibrant
and noisy as ever.

Japan Boulevard extends both east and west from here, filling the area with the
sounds, smells, and sights of commerce. Tall office buildings rise over the
street, framed by evenly spaced streetlamps. To the west, looming over the
street, are numerous tall buildings covered with scaffolding. Day by day, new
and beautifully architectured parts of the older buildings emerge as the
revitalization of Japan Boulevard proceeds. The latest of these is a divine
formal shop called 'The White Tie Affair,' where elegantly posed mannequins in
ball gowns and tailcoats grace the store's tall display windows. Across the
street is an exclusive jewelry store with an elegant sign beside the entrance,
reading: 'Bonita.'

This block of Japan Boulevard has recently begun a commercial rejuvenation.
Where it was somewhat rundown before the war, the infusion of money from private
businesses has brought a new atmosphere of bustle and success to the area. On
the lower floor of a brick building on the northern side of the street, a
delightful-looking breakfast restaurant with a large plate glass window in the
front has just opened. 'Colt's Kitchen and Catering' is painted across the
window in cheerful red letters. The Boulevard continues both to the east and
west.

The scent of Mexican foods drifts toward you from the northwest. The AEU's
blackened tower looms above the smallish buildings here, but no one seems to pay
it any mind. The buildings seem to be mainly restaurants and wholesale shops.
Even though the entire area is rather dingy and poor-looking, as if the
colonists from the third world areas of Old Earth simply recreated their old
life here on new soil, it seems to have suffered little from the war. Business
is lively and the sounds of conversation in old languages can be heard all along
the street.

Though most cultures have blended over the years, old Mexican culture still
thrives here. Children from nearby apartment buildings play in small yards
ringed with chain link fencing. Faint phrases of the old language can barely be
made out as mothers converse with their children and neighbors. The scent of
Mexican food swims inside your nostrils from a small restaurant to the side of
the street.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small neon purple
flowers, a pair of white low rise denim jeans, and a pair of lavender leather
boots.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a large
expandable telescoping xenology container, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria
perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Joel says, "Interesting."
Akemi says, "If he was aiming for Andy's, he overshot."
Melinda says to Lily, "It shouldn't take us more than a day to get there."
Joel asks, "Where did he head to?"
"Not sure," says Akemi.
Joel nods.
Cilah says, "Andy's is at like 69 on the ndb."
"He took off without telling anyone anything," says Akemi, "as far as I know."

She appears to be 26 years old. She is about five feet and ten inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is athletic with attractively curved hips and firm
calves. She has slender shoulders and large breasts. Her abdomen is smooth and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and quite pretty, with a small nose
and dimpled chin. Her lips are generous and rose-pink and occasionally part to
reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
brown and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is dark purple with
silver streaks and drawn back in a ponytail. She has long clear fingernails. She
has a black scrunchie in her hair.
A tiny platinum stud pierces her right upper ear, a small enameled yellow fist
pierces her right earlobe, a small enameled yellow fist pierces her left
earlobe, and a shiny platinum ring pierces her belly button.
She is wearing a pair of sunglasses with round mirrored lenses, a buckled black
leather choker, a deep purple cropped leather bomber jacket with a shimmering
dark yellow holographic fist on the back, a body-skimming black cropped tee with
'TORPEDOES' printed in silver across the chest, a platinum watch with a round
face, a pair of skinny black low rise jeans, and a pair of black leather clogs.
She is also wearing a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a dark metallic purple touch einrophone in a dark gray leather phone
holster, and an asteroid hauling supply kit.

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated
green cooler, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Athena
here.

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
