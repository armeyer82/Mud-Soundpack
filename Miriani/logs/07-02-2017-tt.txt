-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200.
At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to
an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500
Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the
Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days
and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be
back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have
returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations.
I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs
to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station
when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this
purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar
favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

To Esteemed President Best and members of the AEU government:
The AEU Pilot Corps is concerned with talk of potentially withdrawing our
contributions to the Accord, both in personnel and funding. We believe this to
be a mistake, and strongly urge the government to reconsider this action. The
threat of the Outsiders, the IFS as well as attacks by pirate factions still
occur on a fairly frequent basis. The Outsiders especially, are a grave concern.
They could return at any time, and if nothing else, overwhelm us all just by
sheer numbers.
In order to combat the threats both within our own borders and in alliance space
in general, we need to all work together. The Accord functions as a central
means for all of the alliances who are involved to contribute resources and
money to make those resources into something useable to combat the threats that
we all encounter on a daily basis. Additionally, the Accord functions as a means
of gathering the relevant intelligence which we tend to use in order to combat
our enemies effectively and with minimal losses.
The AEU has some of the best scientists, who have made some incredible
discoveries and helped further our efforts to combat the dangers we all face.
Our navy, full of the bravest men and women in the alliance have fought
valiantly in many engagements against Outsiders, IFS and even Allied Pirates.
Even the civilian pilots have served in an exemplary manner, having once been at
the forefront of helping to defend all of the alliances in times of invasion.
However, as great as our scientists are, as skilled and brave as our great men
and women in the navy are and as dedicated to the defense of our space as the
civilian pilots may be, the AEU cannot combat the threats to our space alone. We
need to remain in the Accord therefore, to share intelligence and receive
intelligence in turn. We must continue funding the Accord, so that they can
continue to build the ships and weapons which we can use to assist in combatting
our enemies. We need to commit personnel to help defend the space of all other
alliances, so that we too can be safe. We need to allow our scientists to work
with the Accord and the EAOS, so that we can continue to gain advantages over
those who would desire to see nothing more than the downfall of the alliances,
and more importantly, the extinction of the entire human race.
We thank you for taking the time to review our statement, and hope that you will
ultimately do what is in the best interests of humanity, and our alliance.
Signed by:
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200.
At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to
an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500
Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the
Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days
and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be
back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have
returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations.
I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs
to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station
when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this
purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar
favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

I want to express to Ather that I appreciate how he phrased our
statement in such a manner in that it reflects the key reasons why
we must maintain our relationship with the Accord. I know that had
our own concerns as pilots been incorporated, that the Government
would likely discount our position as one which is merely self-
serving. This is one important factor but the over-arching points
which Ather related are the most critical.
At some point, we may be approached to provide our own
justification which relates to how, as AEU pilots, we are able to
serve our Alliance and/or the EAOS and others more effectively
through continued ties with the Accord.
Here is a listing of many of the Ship Upgrades and other Aspects
which will very much limit, if not prevent AEU pilots from engaging
in important work which not only is of benefit to ourselves in the
defense of humanity, exploration and otherwise but to yield
additional income to the AEU Alliance itself. This is by all
means, not a complete list. Feel free to enter additions to this
list and/or comments.
HULL PLATING --
EAOS Plasma Resistant Plating
REACTIONLESS DRIVE --
EAOS Dual Reactionless Mk III
MAIN SENSORS --
EAOS Superstring Perturbation Sensor
WEAPONS
EAOS CRYSTALLINE OPTICS LASER MK II
Super-Heavy Laser
EAOS ELECTROMAGNETIC TORPEDO LAUNCHER MK II
JINU SALVAGE MINIATURIZED PLASMA CANNON
SENSOR DATA --
Outsider Scan Signatures
All Databases which reflect other known species
SALVAGING EQUIPMENT --
Targeting computer --
AutoVector navigation unit
Exploration Related --
Central Stellar Cartography onboard library
Rift drive
Anomaly detector
Scientific sensor rigging
Communications Range Safety System
Standard NDB Locator
Torus Extra Long-Range NDB Locator
Optical spectroscope
Radio spectroscope
X-ray spectroscope
Deep space probe launcher
Observer Probe Firmware
Exploration-grade expanded probe racks
Exploration-grade databanks expansion
Communications translation interface
Spacesuit radio network
Local message board
Quantum entanglement communicator
Security Xenology Storage Container
Flight Lockers
Concerning the EAOS specific work which we all engage in from time
to time,
please consider the following --
All organizations funds are EAOS
Tolls from Travel entry points are paid in EAOS currency to
organizations as well as require EAOS Credits for payment.
We could lose access to the ability to purchase Temporary Space
Station Modules altogether if we are denied access to the
Requisition shop on Accord. We may no longer be able to
purchaseAEU cores and not to mention, new organizations may not be
able to form as we may not be able to purchase facilities for
organizations.
New pilots utilize Space Vermin Patrol to develop their entry-level
skills. It can easily be stated that SVP hasn't always been
available to new pilots but it does present additional loss of
income from the work performed on the behalf of their sVP
trainingMissions
Accord Missions --
I don't think that I need to explain how important Accord Combat
Missions are. Dou to their advanced level, these are very
beneficial to promote better combat skills overall.
Accord Salvage Missions -- these obviously promote the
availability of higher grade debris to salvage and income to our
Alliance.
Tesla --
Losing access to Tesla would mean that Ground Combat development
would be limited moreso. There would be no means to sell and
purchase Mini Modules as well.
Loss of access to the EAOS Battlesuit. - it is possible but will
be challenging to cleanse the Old Frontier Space Station ducts
without the use of EAOS. Rats Battlesuits can be utilized but they
are more difficult to obtain.
Starshipss Likely No Longer Available --
Two-Person Accord Gemini
Module Transporters other than the AEU Space Constructor.
Beacon Decoys for Beacon drops and Launchers --
There is no facility other than Accord to purchase these items.
Note --
I am certain that this list is not complete. However, here's
something to consider if we are no longer working cooperatively
with the EAOS as pilots.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

She appears to be 34 years old. She is about five feet and four inches tall and
has freckled skin. Her body is slightly pudgy with wide hips and strong calves.
She has broad shoulders and somewhat large breasts. Her face is round,
many-freckled, and unexceptional, with a large nose and dimpled chin. Her lips
are full and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of slightly yellowed
teeth. Beneath a set of bushy eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and beady. Her
ear-length, slightly curly hair is flame red and unkempt. She has short rosy
fingernails. She has a small mole on her upper lip.
 She is wearing a black shipsuit, a black utility belt, and a pair of bright
cherry red canvas sneakers. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board
reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a small cloth sack, a forest green flat
einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a metachannel FTL communicator

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Firestorm. Welcome to Accord space."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a high tech silver star print
holovid, a clear plastic food storage container, and Cheri-Pye the large light
violet felo here.
