11:24 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i wonder if we shouldn't try to go ools as a org together? do you think matt and them would like to do something like that?"
11:24 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "oh wow, ok, that's nice"
11:25 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "We've thought about it, but Matt gets bored after about a thousand light years."
11:26 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "but maybe, now that we can have communications for a longer period, he might not get bored?"
11:27 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Last time Kitty and I went out of locals, we went 7500 light years before turning around. Apparently, he still get bored. heh"
11:27 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
11:28 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "He likes the danger and the threat of danger. Going out of locals doesn't provide enough of that for him I think."
11:29 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "there's not much in locals in any case for him either, not as far as i've seen, it's like people is to scared of him"
11:29 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "You do have a point there."
11:30 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "maybe we can talk to him when you guys come back? if kitty wants, we all can go out again after new year?"
11:30 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Sure. We can definitely talk about it. Just keep in mind that Kitty and I were planning to go out of locals for several months after the New Year."
11:32 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "But I sure wouldn't mind more people coming along. It's up to Kitty though as it's her ship. Although, if we got enough people, we could take my transverser."
11:32 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "give me a sec"
11:33 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Sure."
11:41 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "let's see when you guys come back, maybe we can have a meeting, and talk about it"
11:41 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Sounds good to me."
11:42 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i just think it would be fun, we can get to know each other better, and i'm sure if we are a few more people, it can go quicker than just when two people fly?"
11:45 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I agree with you. It'd definitely be fun."
11:45 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "As long as we have food, drinks, and a shower and bed, I'm happy."
11:46 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
11:46 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "We'll definitely have that."
11:47 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "or even if we plan a smaller trip for the org, and then when we get back, you two can go out again? i don't know, but we should talk about it when you guys get back"
11:47 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "For sure."
11:47 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i'm so excited just thinking about it, they all should wake up so we can talk about it now"
11:47 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
11:47 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
11:48 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Well, Kitty won't probably be awake for at least another hour or so."
11:48 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits through a fit of giggles, "And who knows when that matt will wake up."
11:49 [Private | Amore Carver] You chuckle and transmit, "Go hunt him down and throw water on him. Maybe that'll wake him up?"
11:50 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "do you want him to throw me on his torcher chair?"
11:50 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
11:50 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh and transmit, "That depends on what you're into... Never mind. Not going there."
11:51 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits through a fit of giggles, "Hmm, I might just like it."
11:51 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
11:52 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "how long do you know matt for?"
11:53 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I just met him like maybe a month ago. Probably even less. Kitty has known him for about nine years I think."
11:53 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "wow that's a long time to know somebody"
11:53 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yep."
11:54 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "you know, he was the first person i met when i came to the pilot community?"
11:54 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, I think I remember that actually."
11:55 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "And just because he liked my ship's name, he wanted a link, and he has been a awesome friend to me ever since."
11:56 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, I remember that conversation where you two compared ship names. That was cool."
11:56 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
11:56 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "You guys were talking over short range and I happened to be in the sector."
11:57 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "oh really? wow and here we are best friends too, it's just so awesome"
11:57 [Private | Amore Carver] You enthusiastically transmit, "It really is!"
11:58 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "now if i can just get to 1500 points, i've decided that i rather want to be in AIE"
11:58 [Private | Amore Carver] You cheer and transmit, "Yay! Go AIE!"
11:59 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
11:59 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Actually, I've considered switching to Common Wealth, but have been hesitant about it."
12:00 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "don't, it's not that cw isn't good, but i got the idea that IAE are more a family than what cw is"
12:01 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, I like the CW ships though. At least their specialty ships."
12:01 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "and i fell in love with the transverser, matt took me to that station called heart of nights, and i loved the way it just gobbled up the distances"
12:02 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "It really is a cool ship. A bit difficult to solo, but a great ship anyways."
12:02 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i understand that, but Matt solo it, so it can be done, just practise i guess"
12:03 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yep. I took my transverser out with just one other person and we did fine. Even fought off a muzati and an Onno in the same sector. That was fun."
12:04 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "that time we went out too, it's not that difficult and it is a very sexy ship"
12:04 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yep."
12:05 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i just need 570 more points, it's not that much, but it feels like i'm never going to get there"
12:05 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:05 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Kitty's just very cautious about things so she won't do it. She's lost a couple of very expensive ships in the past."
12:05 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Oh, you will."
12:06 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i can understand that, i would feel the same as her, if i had lost ships"
12:06 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "She lost a gunship that was worth over 2 to 3 billion credits in a very long fight with a muzano."
12:07 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "oh wow, i would cry i swear"
12:07 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, so you'll never see her fly around in expensive ships."
12:08 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "My gs isn't that much worth, and I'll cry my eyes out if I lost it."
12:09 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I know the feeling. I've lost two gunships already."
12:09 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "especially if somebody stole it"
12:09 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I had one stolen and the other blown up."
12:10 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "that's just to much cash to lose"
12:11 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, hence why I'm out of locals trying to earn credits."
12:11 [Private | Amore Carver] You chuckle.
12:11 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:13 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "But I love my transverser too."
12:14 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i can imagine, i love it, and i'm not even in AIE"
12:15 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh and transmit, "A lot of people love it that are not AIE. In my last org, we took a trip in my transverser."
12:16 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i think the best ship ever would be if they combine all the great features of all the specialty ships in to one"
12:17 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Oh, HG has a ship that does that. It was a blast to be in it."
12:17 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "oh wow, just imagine what that ship can do"
12:20 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "When I saw the transverser, I've decided, before I marry a guy that's in AIE, just so I can be in one, I'll switch, and then I will have my very own shippy."
12:21 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
12:21 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits through a snicker, "Don't you think I'm a clever girl?"
12:23 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "You are. And the ship is the 15-person Leviathan and yes, it could do I think just about everything. It even had wavewarp."
12:24 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "oh i've heard of that ship, i just didn't know it had all the features, and thanks, you are a clever man to realize i'm also clever"
12:24 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:25 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
12:28 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I got so lost in that ship though. It's huge!"
12:28 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i would have loved to be in one, i get lost in the senti, i don't like that ship much"
12:29 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah the Sentie is confusing. I've gotten used to it though."
12:29 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i guess i will if i do missions in it regularly, it's just so big"
12:30 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, you would."
12:30 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I want to get a dart someday."
12:31 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i plan to get all the ships on the market, when i have my house one day, then i want to collect ships"
12:31 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I'll probably collect ships once I have my station."
12:32 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i want a house, a station, a moon and then a planet of my own"
12:32 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah, me too."
12:32 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I've already started to design my station. I don't have the points for one yet, but oh well."
12:32 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "We'll be the riches people in the whole universe."
12:33 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
12:34 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "when i'm as old a pilot as matt i want all of that, and i want to retire and sit and enjoy my belongings"
12:34 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:35 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh and transmit, "Yeah, Kitty has been a pilot about as long as Matt has if not longer and she doesn't even have a planet of her own yet."
12:38 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:39 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "see, we'll have to work hard"
12:40 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "For sure."
12:41 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "It'll take me so long that I'm not even sure if Kitty will still be around when I finally do get my planet."
12:42 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "If not, we'll have to enjoy our old age together."
12:42 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh.
12:43 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Oh I'm sure you'll have a special guy to enjoy it with."
12:43 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:44 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "You'll be married have like a hundred kids and you two can grow old together."
12:45 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "I don't know about that, and that's another thing, I can't have kids, so I don't know if a man would want to marry me if he finds out I can't have any."
12:46 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Well, there's always adoption and if he loves you enough, that won't stop him from marrying you."
12:47 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Kitty doesn't want to get married."
12:47 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "maybe, but for now, i'm way to young to want to think of marage or kids"
12:47 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "and you would want to?"
12:48 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Eventually I'd like to get married. I mean, not necessarily like tomorrow or next month, but certainly someday. And nothing wrong with waiting."
12:49 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i would want to get married too, but just not right now, i still want to do so much before that"
12:50 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "That's understandable."
12:50 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "Unless I feel in my heart that the man is the one I would want to be with for the rest of my life, then I'll get married tomorrow."
12:50 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Kitty just doesn't want to get married at all in the future."
12:51 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "maybe she'll change her mind, you never know"
12:51 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh and transmit, "And you never know, that can happen when you least expect it."
12:51 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "my sentiments exactly"
12:52 [Private | Amore Carver] You chuckle and transmit, "Once Kitty makes up her mind, her mind is made up."
12:52 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "maybe, but then, you are a great guy, so who knows?"
12:53 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh and transmit, "Oh I think you give me way more credit than I deserve. I'm really not that great."
12:54 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i'm not wrong when i meet people, and i know you are, so stop trying to convince me otherwise"
12:54 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
12:55 [Private | Amore Carver] You chuckle.
12:57 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Honestly though, I like to flirt way too much. It's one of my biggest weaknesses."
12:59 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i know, and i like it too, i just think that people shouldn't see to much in it than what there really is, i mean it doesn't mean that if we flirt, that we are having an afair or want to jump in to each others clothes, but that's just me, that's why i told you that it doesn't make me feel uncomfortable"
13:00 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Same here."
13:01 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "And I'm not a jelouss person at all, so if I am with a guy, and he flirts with other woman, I wouldn't hit his head off, I would actually enjoy seeing how he charm other woman, and how they would react to it."
13:01 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
13:02 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Yeah same here. I actually enjoy watching my significant other flirt and such, but Kitty won't at all."
13:04 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i think it's sexy, because i know it doesn't mean anything, just fun, but it should then be the same for me, he shouldn't get jelouss if i flirt because we both have to be secure in what we have"
13:04 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "As long as she comes home to me and she's open and honest about things, then it's all good."
13:04 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i agree"
13:05 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "The problem is that she has had other women steal her significant other away, so she's not as secure in her relationships as she otherwise could be."
13:07 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i can understand that, but i believe it starts with yourself, be secure in your own sexuality, and how you look, then if a man leaves you for another woman, just always tell yourself that he is the one that's lost out, since you are the best any man can have, or woman, in a man's possision"
13:07 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I mean for example, when Kitty and I were first starting to get to know each other, she told me she didn't mind cuddling with a friend. When I asked her if she would cuddle with other guys, she said no and that I'd better not cuddle with other women. So, it kind of confused me."
13:08 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "That's a good attitude to have."
13:08 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "that would confuse me too, so she'll cuddle with a girl friend, but not a male friend?"
13:09 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I don't even know what she meant by that. She was still just talking about male friends I thought, so..."
13:09 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
13:10 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "So I didn't actually know if we were officially a couple yet. I mean, how do I interpret that?"
13:11 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "The thing is, I like atention from men, I love it when they compliment me on how I look, because it means that I'm taking care of myself, but I won't jump in to bed with anybody, unless I feel more than friendship for him, and it won't happen the first or second night, and if other woman think that I'm a cheep or loose woman, so be it, I know who and what I am, and I love it."
13:11 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "I don't know, I would just ask right out."
13:12 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "YEah, so can I ask you a question?"
13:12 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "A kind of personal question."
13:12 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "sure"
13:14 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Well, would you let a guy sleep in the same bed with you for... seven months without... umm, getting intimate?"
13:15 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "And sorry if that's too personal"
13:15 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i'm no rock, i have needs like any other person, but i would sleep next to a man without doing anything, if that is what he wants, but if we both want sex, and i'm in love with him, yes i would jump him as much as he wants me too"
13:16 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i hope that answered your question"
13:18 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "It did. It's not that I didn't want the affection. It's just rather difficult for me not to touch her if she's sleeping in the same bed with me but only wants to cuddle and it goes on for seven months. I don't know. I just think that at some point, hormones kick in and natural desire takes over...? MAybe I'm weird."
13:21 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "It's like... Here, let me sleep next to you with little to no clothes on but don't touch any of my private areas and I don't know if and when I'll be comfortable with you touching me in those places, but we can just cuddle like this forever."
13:21 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Sorry."
13:21 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i'll be honest with you, to me that is teasing a man beyond what he can endure, and i wouldn't be able to take it if a man did that to me"
13:21 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "there's nothing as great as teasing and playing around with the one you are involved with, maybe i'm just to weard too"
13:21 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "And that, my friend is why I broke up with Kitty the first time."
13:22 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i can understand that, can i ask you a personal question about her?"
13:22 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "You can."
13:23 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "You can always ask. I may or may not answer it."
13:23 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "does she ever wear provocative clothes for you?"
13:25 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "On occasion, but often she doesn't have time to do much afterwords. So it's like, here. Let me wear something that would make you want to jump me, but we don't have enough time to be intimate. Sorry."
13:27 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "but that's not right tibo, if i wear almost nothing, i can't expect the guy not to want to jump me, that's why i do it in the first place, don't get me wrong, i'm not critizing her, i just think that if she doesn't want anything intimate to happen, she shouldn't do that, and she either should change, or let you go, to get a girl that would want you to jump her at every opportunity you get"
13:29 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I know you're not trying to criticize her and I'm not either. ?She's a great pilot and a great woman. But yeah, I'm a bit torn because I'd love for her to just wear like bra and underwear when we're on trips like this together, but then I'd want to jump her bones and she wouldn't necessarily have time for it. So, I kind of feel like I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. Sorry for the cussing."
13:31 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "It's fine, I can hear your frustration, and the only thing I can think of, is that you should really talk to her, tell her how you feel, maybe tell her that if she doesn't want any intimate relations between you, then she shouldn't tease you to the point that you want to jump her, and then have the frustration not to be able to. Besides, she might enjoy it so much, she'll want to jump you every other day."
13:32 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "My ex was better about flirting and teasing. At one point, this girl was feeling lonely and a bit depressed and my girlfriend told her, come hang out with us because Tibo wants to flirt with you. It totally made me laugh."
13:32 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "if the guy i'm with wanted to flirt with another woman in front of me, i wouldn't mind, i would like to sit and watch"
13:32 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs and transmits, "Now you can tell me I'm weard."
13:33 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "?Oh I'm sure I'm weirder than that. That's not weird at all."
13:34 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i want to ask you another question"
13:34 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Well,m at the same time, we have talked and I know where she's coming from. She just wants plenty of time to be intimate. She's not the tear your clothes off and go for it, fast and hard. And I'm not trying to be graphic so sorry."
13:35 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "And go for it."
13:36 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "no but doing it impulsively is also fun, when you just can't get your clothes off quick enough, my question, what do you think of a three or foursome? have you ever done it before?"
13:37 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I have not, and I'm not opposed to it. There would obviously be some ground rules, but I'd love to try it. But Kitty would kill me if I even mentioned it. She's already told me."
13:38 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i haven't done it either, but the guy i'm seeing? we talked about it, and i thought it could be amazingly fun"
13:39 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I'm sure it could be. Like I said, ground rules would have to be set, but as long as everyone is ok. Why not?"
13:40 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "of course"
13:41 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "I'm just open like that, but as I said, you have to be very comfortable with yourself to be able to do that, without falling apart."
13:42 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Same here."
13:43 [Private | Amore Carver] You laugh and transmit, "But Kitty wouldn't even let another guy so much as give her a pat on the butt."
13:43 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i'm also not uncomfortable to talk to my male friends openly abouht things"
13:43 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver laughs.
13:43 [Private | Amore Carver] Amore Carver transmits, "i wouldn't kiss another guy if i'm with somebody, but you can't keep a guy from patting your butt if he wanted too"
