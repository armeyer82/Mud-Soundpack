Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

launch
The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.
launch
You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You can go west.
A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a

battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!

Glyphmaker colors
green is blue and yellow Cancel with red
orange is red and yellow cancel with Blue
violet is red and blue cancel with Yellow
indigo is violet and blue cancelled by saffron
fuchsia is violet and red cancelled by chartreuse
ochre is violet and yellow
vermillion is orange and red cancelled by teal
saffron is orange and yellow cancelled by indigo
taupe is orange and blue
chartreuse is green and yellow cancelled by fuchsia
teal is green and blue cancelled by vermillion
sienna is green and red
blue cancel with Orange
Yellow cancel with Violet
If the glyph at the door flashes black, we cancel it. If white, we match it. So
if we get a red one, it'll flash black, flash a blue and a yellow. If we get an
indigo that flashes white, we first make a violet glyph, then a blue one. If
that indigo flashes black, we cancel it by making a saffron glyph (make an
orange glyph, then add yellow).
