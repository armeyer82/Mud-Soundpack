Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft
black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an insulated green cooler, a compact white
refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, a small blue ball containing
a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, Ciera the humanoid service robot, Kiwi the little calico CatBot, and
Meow the little calico CatBot here.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Living Quarters Two]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow,

on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a large oval dark
purple and light purple cloth rug, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy
seashell pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow,

each direction from Feng Wo Station which is in the center."

Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "So I really don't know what to suggest.
Have you gone down at all?"

thought pushed us pretty far down."

Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "About five lightyears in."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "We figured we were too far east since the
flow has been pushing us east the whole journey south."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Going west though brought the ndb down to
68."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "And sean went from 70 to 69."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So we figured we'd run a search grid up
and east."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But going up brought the ndb for us back
up to 69, and then 70."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "And we've been hitting storms off and on
since I woke up."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Are you aware of any points of interest
to be on the lookout for?"
Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo wanders out.
Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "First off I think 70 means we're not far
in enough and the only point of interest I can think of is there is an OORG not
far from Andy's."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Sorry OORT."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Sean saw a nebula."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Does that ring any bells?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah there may be that or a pre-stellar
but I don't remember."

Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "WEll time to turn, we can head south back
to 69."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Lily Kaise nods.
Johann Rowan quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 270.0, 0.0.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So we are either too high or too low but
I definitely think we should be around 69."
The curtains close, to no applause.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I sure wish I could still chart but I
only could chart in Spinward and those are pretty non-existent."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Do the charting arrays let you choose
your notation?"
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I've been looking to learn, but Aisling
only knows a random notation, and Pierre won't teach me."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They are dependent upon the skill of the
creater of the chart."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The higher the skill levle, the wider
range of the chart."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, just a shame we don't have a qe
device along, we could get a hypercast from home."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I do have an Antispinward chart but I
didn't get to the point where I oculd interpret the notation."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Maybe if you keep studying it it will
make sense?"
Johann Rowan grins at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Sometimes but your primary skill has to
be at some level before you can begin to recognize another notation."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, just a shame people willing to
teach are so hard to find."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders south.
Ari the medium-sized black long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

easily to us who are planet born."
A long black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its
tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of Benjamin Masterson, then
loses interest and jets off.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But even still, it's an important tool, I
think it's irresponsible of our fellow pilots and of our alliances for not
giving us access to such an important safety net."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's not that though. As I say, not
everyone can acquire the skill."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, but not being given the opportunity
to try."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "However, yes there is a great technology
out there in the way of the onboard mainframe but that requires a higher level
of Exploration experience and the only one who has an Imperator is Nissi."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "That's the part that annoys me."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I understand."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, I've been turned down for that
application three times."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think you need at least 5000
exploration for that though."

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft
black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an insulated green cooler, a compact white

most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as
somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark
gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run
down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the
way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is
