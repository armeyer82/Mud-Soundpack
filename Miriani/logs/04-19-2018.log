["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Planet 281543.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an interna
01:43 l stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, a purple velvet artifact storage container, Mekensie the droid, and a commodity listing here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Planet 335357.

04:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

04:43 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

04:44 #$#soundpack_pong

04:44 #$#soundpack_lag 108

04:44 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

04:44 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

04:44 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

04:44 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a chunk of ice containing traces of amino acids onto the ground nearby.

04:44 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a chunk of ice containing traces of amino acids."

04:44 You flick a switch to enable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.

04:53 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

04:53 I don't understand that.

04:53 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

04:53 You flick a switch to enable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.

04:53 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

04:53 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a chunk of ice containing traces of amino acids onto the ground nearby.

04:53 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a chunk of ice containing traces of amino acids."

04:59 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

04:59 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

04:59 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

04:59 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a chunk of ice containing traces of amino acids onto the ground nearby.

04:59 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a chunk of ice containing traces of amino acids."

04:59 You flick a switch to enable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

It is addressed to nobody and was sent by nobody.
Dear tibo My Love! I am so sad ... I know I had left my kids and robots in your trannie but here I noticed you had left. I initially thought you just went out for work ... then I saw my things in the garage. I didn't think much of it but I went over to Acrylon to look around in your trannie for some other things that I knew were still in there and I noticed that i no longer have a key! Pray to the stars ... what is wrong? What did I do for you to just leave me like this? I also checked the keys to the apartment and noticed yours was gone so I guess you threw that away? I then noticed you've deleted our private link and you're not allowing me to track you anymore. I know what I said the other day may have seemingly been hurtful towards you. I honestly meant nothing towards you at all. I just meant that I am so fed-up with the heavy-handed tactics of others. I would hate to be a new pilot these days, just trying to make a few credits and everytime they try to launch, they are hurled into a mine field and lose everything. I can afford it but they can't. I just find it painful to observe this going on day after day and my first inclination is to run away from all of this madness! You know too, I didn't say I would leave right away as I wanted you to have the opportunity to do more work and to decide if you truly wanted to go with me. I am enclosing another key to the apartment. 
15:34 You are still welcome anytime even if you don't want to stay with me. I love you Tibo, more than you will ever know. Please come back ... oh please do come back. If you just can't, please then, I believe I do deserve an explanation as to why I was all of a sudden abandoned by the man who I consider to be the most awesome man in the Universe. I love you Tibo. - Kitty

15:35 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty from Tibo - 08-06-2363]
Kitty,
Im writing this letter as a last resort. If you truly love me, then I need you to act like it and at least give me the dignity of listening to my side of the story.
Cria and Fawkes have been hunting me ever since I joined the Calaway's organization. Fawkes took it personally that I left without telling him. Around the same time or soon thereafter, Anton fired on my expediter. Not my gunship, but my expediter. I almost lost my expediter several times coming into sector 15 because of all of the automated laser turrets that were frequently being put there. This is why I started flying around in a gunship as the gunship was able to withstand the laser fire and get me safely to Empanda. Maybe you disagree with the fact that I was flying around in a gunship, but that is why. I at least need you to understand.
If I am truly a coward, then why did people not call me that after I left with you and the Calaway's to go get their gunship? It was clearly my ship and we left out of sector 5. This happened after I was already being hunted by Cria and Fawkes. The next time I left to go out of locals was last month when I left out of sector 37. Remembering what you told me about the transverser not being a very good combat ship should we run into Praelor in deep space, I followed what you taught me by taking my gunship which I had upgraded for exploration. I left out of sector 37 intending to go to Celestia located Northwest and up from sector 37. I brought my tranny since I had no other ship that had medical facilities if Miriam and I had been injured in any way. I docked it in the gunship so that if we ran into Praelor on the way to Celestia, I could solo the gunship easier if need be. I also docked my fighter as a back up plan.
So no, I was not just transporting my tranny over to Miriam's place. I was trying to go to Celestia so that I could do some atmospheric salvaging there and had brought my tranny and fighter for the reasons above. The first time I attempted to leave, Cria and Fawkes showed up in their battle cruiser and heliogaster respectively. I asked for assistance and so did Miriam as she was with me. Ryan eventually showed up in his BC and by coordinating with us, we managed to jump out. 
I attempted it again a few days later and Cria chased me out of sector 37 again. This time, we saw him coming and jumped out before he got to us to another sector. The third time is when my gunship was blown up and I temporarily lost my tranny.
To those who call me a coward, it is important to choose your battles and to them I ask, "Who is the real coward?" Is it me with the least experience, or the ones with years experience fighting other pilots and purposefully out numbering the less experienced pilot? I would say it is the latter. It takes no courage whatsoever to fight an adversary that you know you have out gunned, and out numbered. That's trul
15:35 y a coward's act in my book. It takes more courage, maturity and more humility to talk with people instead of just throwing fists, so to speak.
So I don't care who calls me a coward. They should look at themselves first. You invited me out of locals soon after we broke up which would have probably coincided with the time I ended up leaving. Would I have been a coward then? I refuse to live my life in locals, because blood thirsty warmongers want me to. I joined the pilot corps to explore deep space, not to follow the whim, wants, desires, and irrational behavior of those who can't use words to negotiate and would rather just slug it out in a back alley. It's not my style and I refuse to bow down to that.
So, if you truly love me, and since you're obviously in contact with those people hunting me. You can pass on my message. Seems like you'd rather kiss their butts instead of give me the least bit of consideration or the benefit of the doubt.
If the roles were reversed, I would do what ever it took to defend you if I truly loved you. I would give anything to protect you and uphold your dignity and pride. I would give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to your side completely before making any judgements. You have done none of this. Cria and Fawkes and the people who call me cowards refuse to use this thing called words to negotiate with me. They tell you instead of telling me and what do you tell them? You agree with them, right? You question what I did without even knowing all of the facts. You assume that I'm just this little doggy that Miriam has wrapped around her little finger. Well, think twice. If you really think that, then you obviously didn't know me very well.
After you found out that my gunship got blown up, you immediately began to reprimand me. You barely offered any sympathy or gave me a chance to explain myself. So you know what? I don't feel the love tonight. You can tell me all you want, but you need to show me. Not just tell me.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
