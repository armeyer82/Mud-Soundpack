Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your
periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy
white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the
distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, Zorya
the hovering dragonfly robot, an elegant crystal decanter, a small blue
insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a bottle of
expensive cognac, Peaches the little white CatBot, a clear plastic food storage
container, and a cream plastic box labeled 'Space Imager Photos' here.
Simon Collins is sleeping on a black leather sectional sofa.
Anfisa of Marzore is sitting on a modern white pod chair. Nissi Valdaire is
dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch. Blake Madison is seated. Akemi
Bando is sitting on a dark yellow leather captain's chair. Morris Corlew and
Lily Kaise are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go southeast, southwest, and out.

Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Lily's smiling. I'm

A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

Lily laughs.
"Ok then," says Lily.

The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.

Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat

The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into

The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship

The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in
the opposite direction.
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startingly like a single
unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass
is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a
glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created
here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
