02:46 Amore,
During the trip that Kitty and I took out of locals to get her ship, we had plenty of time to talk about her and my relationship in the past. I won't go into very many details, but we did discuss something that you might be interested in.
During many discussions, I have expressed to Kitty that I am a very affectionate and flirtatious person. She understands this and also knows that many of her and my issues in the past arose because of lack of communication between her and me. Anyways, I did tell her that some time ago, you did ask me regarding participation in a threesome or foursome. I did explain to her that the foursome was in case she and I were together.
She expressed that what made her uncomfortable was the fact that she has not had an opportunity to get to know you. She has no desire to do anything that would hurt your relationship with Matt. She also reiterated that she wishes not to be touched sexually by another woman. I assured her that you did not have a desire to be intimate with her. So, in order for Kitty to feel comfortable enough to consider such an activity or arrangement, she would need to have some social interaction with you. 
If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to talk to either of us.
Sincerely,
Tibo

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

19:49 [Newbie] Matteo Hayes: Quick question, I somehow got a starship destruction bounty as an eng durring a mission though it wasn't very much, is it because I used pulses? What I'm asking is, can I leech off of everyone's starship destructions by pulsing the soon to be vanquished?

19:49 [Newbie] Cara West: That's legal pulses count towards starship destruction so you're not leeching.

21:25 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a pair of gray sneakers with red laces, and a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.
You can go south.

21:25 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet.
