04:27 Katrianne Beauchene says, "i probably have it in my lore"

04:27 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Radio Receiver]

04:27 A scientist says, "I need the following items to complete the receiver. A small
box with holes in it and a single knob on the side, a small monopole magnet, a
thin triangular piece of metal, a misshapen mass of metal, a flexible piece of
wire, a flat heavy object with a series of buttons and knobs on it, a tiny metal
chip, a device flashing numerous alien symbols, a glowing metallic object with
two terminals on top, and a small piece of plastic with a series of bumps etched
on it. If you can put all of these in a container I will give you and return
here, and if you have at least 6500 license points, simply ask me again if you
can have a receiver. I'll sell you one in exchange for the items and fifty
million credits."

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras

You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, and an all-occasions party robotic chef here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

Starship Weapons
--------------------------------------------------
  Laser Turrets
Laser turrets are small turrets mounted on the hull that focus energy into an amplified beam of light in order to cause damage to a target. 
Pros:
Can fire without confirming a target.
Usually abundant on most ships.
Cons:
Begin to lose effectiveness the more they are damaged.
Require a fair amount of starship charge to fire.
Can be reflected back at you if the target has laser reflectors.
  Bardenium Cannons
Bardenium Cannons are small launchers along the starship's hull that, when activated, fire a chunk of charged bardenium at a target. The damage done by bardenium cannons is dependant on the type of bardenium being fired as well as the physical mechanism required to launch the bardenium.
Pros:
50% chance of doing hull damage.
Require less power to fire.
Aren't reduced in capacity by damage.
Cons:
Require reloading with ammunition.
Pro/Con:
Require confirming a target before they fire.
  Computer Disruption Pulse
The CDP fires a carefully modulated energy pulse at an enemy starship which will temporarily disrupt certain computers aboard the target starship. The primarily affected function is autopilot. While all ship classes are different, the majority of the time the CDP will cause sluggish response in starship autopilot and can even disable it entirely. The effects are only temporary and the initial pulse does requi
16:56 re quite a bit of power, but it's nonetheless an effective weapon against ISC designed ships. The CDP is effective at ranges up to four units and requires six minutes to recharge, drawing power from the ship's main battery. Note that the weapon is not always effective. Under certain circumstances, it will fail to have an effect. This is always the case when using it against biological technology.
Range: 4 units
Recharge Time: 6 minutes
Effect: Slow down autopilot functions.
Usage: DISRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Disarmament Pulse
The DP is a pulse weapon that will fire a burst of energy at an enemy starship that specifically targets (conventional) weapons.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 60 seconds
Effect: Causes small amounts of damage to one or more weapon systems on the target starship.
Usage: DISARM. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Sensor Interruption Pulse
The sensor interruption pulse fires a directed burst of energy that's specifically modulated to cause damage to only a starship's sensor array.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 1 minute
Effect: Causes a small amount of damage to the target starship's sensor array.
Usage: INTERRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Immobilization Pulse
The IP is a pulse weapon that, similar to the DP, will target only a ship's wormhole drive with the intent of immobilizing a target without the
16:56  use of interdictors.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 1 minute
Effect: Causes a small amount of damage to the target's wormhole drive.
Usage: IMMOBILIZE. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Autolocking Long-range Laser
Usage: LRL
  Standard Long-range Laser
Usage: Same as regular lasers.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
