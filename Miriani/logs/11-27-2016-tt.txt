-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a white four poster rattan
bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed
pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval
turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and Shasta the big onyx soldier felo
here.
You can go out.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Too Hot To Handel"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a white destination finder, and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
Johann Rowan and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

proactive then and set up a station we can use to help with the defense."

Johann."

[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We'd like to but i'm in the rift
currently. Akemi, feel free to use something from Seas from the parts on Cats
Spare Parts though."
[Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Sure, we can do that."
[Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If you also want long range
lasers or something like that, it will have to be 2 stations."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'll get the flight control
relay itself. Kim can Starseekers provide the power supply? That leaves the core
and maybe a stealth sheath to get another org on there."
[Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I'll meet you in the shop."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose invaders can
contribute the stealth thing. I've been monitoring the situation at that beacon
as well."

parts on some of our ships Lily, from Seas, we could get one of that if you
like?"

anything I can put on with those megacredits?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I beleive the core is left to
decide."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Ted if you want to get the
station core itself that'll work, I think."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What core will it need? I'll
have a look."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "He won't be able to monitor it
using the org tuner. Pretty sure he has to actually have his org contribute to
it."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "He's got a few member-designate
d megacredits I think."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have 10, and I am
monitoring through the Fringe channel 4."
[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "If any of those organizations
are vassalized, they will contribute under Cats right so no need for parts from
them?"
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That's right."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We are OK then."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh, Spatial Stability is a Cats
vassal."

[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's awesome, thanks
again."
[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Thanks for the good work Akemi."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Now, for this to be useful, you
need to have a flight control scanner tuned to the organization channel."

[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Thanks for the help, everyone."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Any time."
[Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Done."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Ted I just double-checked and
Spatial Stability isn't on the list of contributing orgs. Your org didn't chip
in when I purchased the flight control relay part, so I guess that would be
why."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Probably some issue with how
the contributions are set up."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, two of us can monitor
through the Fringe channels, and we are the two that are around the most, and I
thought that would work through cats."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I did too. Might have just been
the way the splits are set up."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches out.
[Tactical Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "Did any of the other vassals
make it onto the station? Come to think of it I don't recall being notified
through Morning Star."

[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Morning Star did not, but
Allied Libertarians did."
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No megacredits were lvied on
it."
[Tactical Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "Huh, strange."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I think there's a 50/25/25
split and the vassals paying 25% were not included."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Since we don't do
half-megacredit contributions."
[Tactical Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "Right."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
