[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while
on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long
counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks
have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to
the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that
the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a
large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise
rattan table with a glass top, a bag of felo treats, a pair of mystic
purple suede clogs, and Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
