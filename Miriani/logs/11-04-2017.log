You can go south and out.

11:43 You press a small red button on the top of a bulky stun armor battery pack.

11:43 The faint glow emanating from a gold stun armor top, a gold stun armor bottom, a gold stun armor helmet, a pair of gold stun armor boots, and a pair of gold stun armor gloves slowly fades.

11:43 You begin carefully disconnecting pieces of armor from a bulky stun armor battery pack.

11:43 (25 seconds roundtime.)

11:44 A stun armor power pack recharging station

11:44 You see nothing special.

11:44 A bulky stun armor battery pack may not be fully charged. Unload it anyway? [Enter "yes" or "no"]

11:44 You firmly grip the top of a bulky stun armor battery pack and press a small release button. The power couplings disengage, and it slides smoothly off of a stun armor power pack recharging station.

11:44 A bulky stun armor battery pack

11:44 You see nothing special.
It appears to be off.
The charge indicator reads 51%.
It has nothing connected to it.

11:45 you carefully place a bulky stun armor battery pack on a stun armor power pack recharging station, sliding it forward until the power couplings connect with a solid click.

11:45 A small green indicator light on a stun armor power pack recharging station blinks on, indicating that connected equipment is being charged.

11:46 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

11:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

11:46 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

11:46 The ship is already moving.

11:46 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

11:46 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

11:46 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

11:46 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

11:46 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

11:46 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

11:46 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

11:46 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

11:46 You stand up.

11:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

11:47 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

11:47 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

11:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

11:47 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

11:47 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

11:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

11:47 For a top, you are wearing a gold stun armor top over a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a gold stun armor bottom over a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread and a pair of white cotton tapered boxers under that. You have a gold stun armor helmet on your head. You are wearing a pair of gold stun armor gloves on your hands and a pair of gold stun armor boots over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a red archaeological artifact storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

11:47 You are carrying a small brush in your right hand.

11:47 You remove your stun armor and place each piece in the designated area in a black stun armor storage bag.

11:47 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a metallic red starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

This neat, uncluttered office exudes an heir of efficiency and purpose. The walls are painted a soft taupe and devoid of decoration. A layer of black and white checker patterned tile lies underfoot and a large securely locked laser proof glass display case stands in the center of the room, its rich velvet lined shelves full of various membership rings and passes. A sales droid is stationed off to the side of the case, ready to assist customers and retrieve merchandise as needed. A set of barely discernable security censors are embedded into the doorway leading back to the east, which is flanked by a pair of ominous looking automated stun turrets.

You can go south and out.

12:08 You can't go that way.

12:09 You have 972,657,191.39 credits.

12:09 The eight-person gunship "Barracuda" is located at Empanda Station; Public Garage.

12:10 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:10 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:10 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:10 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

12:10 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:10 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:10 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:10 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:10 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:10 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

12:10 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:10 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

12:10 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Planets: (4, 4, 7)
Moons: (5, 3, 7)

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (15, 13, 19)

12:10 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:10 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:10 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:10 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:11 The ten-person battlecruiser "Creature" has jumped into the sector.

12:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

12:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:11 There is more than one person who could match 'anton'. Please specify:
[1] Stanton Sefdon
[2] Anton Navarro

Enter your selection:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:11 Anton Navarro (C) (Male) is asleep!

12:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:11 You must stand up first.

12:11 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

12:11 You stand up.

12:11 You remove a droid remote titled "Empanda" from a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

12:11 You gently slide a droid remote titled "Empanda" into a slot on the side of a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. With a soft click, the remote snaps into place and the screen is filled with a live broadcast of Observation Center.

12:11 You start watching a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

12:11 There doesn't seem to be anything of interest in that direction.

12:11 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the three-person freighter "Fair Trade", the one-person fighter "Jump", and the nine-person ameliorator "Ranpura" powered down here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Storm of Torment" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Carnival of Carnage" landed here.

This appears to be an outlet for the upgrade facility on Edge Outpost. Off-white carpet serves to muffle any footfalls. A holographic E is projected over a video screen containing two animated ships. One of the ships, which is much farther from the other in the low-scale image, seems to be emanating some sort of antiquated radio wave. The wave is colored green and wends its way through the vast darkness before colliding with a receiver mounted on the other ship, blue bubbles representing speech spilling forth. Beneath the animated depiction are the words, "Long-Range Communication." Sales droids in uniforms denoting the Empanda Station logo bustle between shelves containing scaled down replicas of the equipment, and a lone clerk sits at a counter in the front of the shop.

In the center of this lavishly decorated circular courtyard is a large stone fountain. Perched in the fountain's crystal blue pool is a regal swan composed of pure white marble. A musical tinkle fills the area from the steady stream that pours from the swan's open beak into the shallow basin at its feet. Around the perimeter of the fountain is a field of lush ferns, the plant's dark green petals falling over the stone's edge to trail lazily across the water's glassy surface. Silver light that streams in from skylights placed on the ceiling reflect off the pale blue tiles covering the floor, and a large white tiled star seems to radiate from the base of the fountain, each of the legs pointing towards a flower-lined pathway that leads up to a large steel building.

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed aboard the one-person AIE runabout "Moggie May" at Acrylon Spaceport.

14:56 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

14:56 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "hmm I wonder how much storage the prox weapons take up"

14:57 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I'm not sure. Not much from what I remember."

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay] (indoors)
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

15:15 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door opens.

15:15 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

15:15 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed aboard the one-person AIE runabout "Moggie May" at Acrylon Spaceport.

15:16 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door closes.

15:16 The computer announces, "The one-person AIE runabout "Starfish" has been secured in the docking bay."

15:16 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Barracuda, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:16 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:16 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:16 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:16 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:16 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

15:16 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:16 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:16 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:16 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:16 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Barracuda. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:16 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:16 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed aboard the one-person AIE runabout "Moggie May" at Acrylon Spaceport.

15:55 You peer out and see...

15:55 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

15:55 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black stun armor storage bag, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a black rolled toolkit, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

15:55 You are carrying a small brush in your right hand.

15:55 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:55 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:55 The computer announces, "There is no repair in progress."

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very 
18:43 particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it like any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

--------------------------------------------------

18:43 --------------------------------------------------
Extended Emotes
--------------------------------------------------
Extended emotes are a system that allows one to directly reference objects or other players in the world itself for a much greater sense of flexibility in the midst of roleplay. There are also a myriad of other features, which are detailed below:

* Replaces with your name. If there is no * in your emote, your name is automatically tacked on to the beginning.
*1 Replaces with your first name.
*2 Replaces with your last name.

-thing Matches to an object in the room. There is no space between the dash and the name. If you only want to use a player's first name, just stick a 1 after their name. If you capitalize your match string, it will appropriately capitalize the matching object. Examples:
    -albori1 would be replaced by "Albori"
    -toast would be replaced by "a slice of toast" if there is a slice of toast in the room
    -Toast would be replaced by "A slice of toast" if there is a slice of toast in the room.
~thing Functions in much the same way as - except it will strip 'a' or 'an' off the beginning of an object's name.
 It's worth noting that you cannot use another player as the very first item in an emote. Allowing this would create confusion when people thought that the player you were referencing was performing an action that they were not. For example: "-merugle gives * an enthusiastic high-five!" Using -merugle as the first word would not work because it would look like a standard emote from Merugle.

%he / %himself / %his / %him - Replaces with the appropriate word for the appropriate person. If you reference multiple objects or people (using dash thing, as described above), you can specify who you're talking about by adding a number after the %his. So for example, if I say: "-albori twirled -merugle, who pushed -lazurus, who ate a sandwich." you would refer to Albori with %he, Merugle with %she2 (or %he2, it doesn't matter), and Lazurus with %he3.

If you capitalize %he, %himself, %his, %him, etc, it will appropriately capitalize the replacement. Example:
    shakes -fred. %He2 is shaken.
becomes...
    Albori Isahost Sninvel shakes Fred Quantultoniel McElk. He is shaken.

* NOTE * Because of ambiguity issues, you should always use %him or %his instead of %her. Sorry ladies! (Don't worry, it'll get the right gender no matter which one you use.)

%{list} will allow you to randomize a very basic list of words. Spaces won't work (for the time being) anywhere between the {}'s, so it is an extremely crude facility for randomization. But it should suffice for now.
Example: %{a,list,of,words,goes,here}

Additionally, you can save your extended emotes for later by creating custom socials. Simply type @custom-socials and follow the prompts to store emotive strings as custom commands for easy access.

It's also possible to pipe a command throug
18:43 h with your extended emote, effectively allowing you to override the standard output of that command. For example, if you want to stand up in a spectacular fashion, you can override the stand command. To do so, you simply add a pipe character ('|') to the end of your text and then the command you want to execute. For example:

  *'s eyes widen in shock. He wobbles unsteadily before collapsing to the ground at -fred's feet. | collapse fred
  Albori Vanishing Point Sninvel's eyes widen in shock. He wobbles unsteadily before collapsing to the ground at Fred Quantultoniel McElk's feet.


A full list of commands can be found by typing 'emote pipes'. If you combine command piping with @custom-socials, the output of your commands will no longer be visible to you with your new emote. In the above example, you would no longer see yourself collapsing at Fred's feet, as the social took over that output.

For players who don't like the command piping system, you can enable a ROOM-OPTION to always show the output of standard commands regardless of what social a player used.

19:00 WARNING: Be advised that the hosts can, and often will, remove custom comm socials for any reason whatsoever without so much as a heads up or any communication with you at all. This feature should be treated as a pleasant summer breeze: It's pleasant and comfortable, but it could disappear any time without warning. If too many of your socials get removed, you will likely be banned from even trying.

19:00 
Short list of socials to not even bother with:
  Anything sexual.
  Anything designed to offend large numbers of people.
  Anything against any of the policies.
  Anything intended to deceive or misdirect another player into believing something that is happening that is not.
  Anything referencing another player, particularly when that player has no desire to be referenced.
  Anything stupid.

19:09 [AIE | Exploration] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "I'm approximately 550 lightyears away from known space. Have discovered a few planets, and 2 wormholes on this journey, and of course, have encountered a few hostile vessles, but nothing one wouldn't expect."

19:10 [AIE | Exploration] Matt Valentino transmits, "Sounds like a good trip so far. Do you have a particular destination in mind?"

19:11 [AIE | Exploration] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "At the moment, I do not. This is one of those trips which, involves making a broad circle, ending up at a point within jump range. That said, I have been to the krenelia outpost in recent months, and if you've never been, would recommend that. It's a nice journey."

19:12 [AIE | Exploration] Matt Valentino transmits, "I haven't personally been there. I plan on going out that way to collect data. I will return to the CTN military base to remember those that were a part of the assault team that invaded that sector on that day long ago. Sometimes I still have flash backs concerning it."

19:13 [AIE | Exploration] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "Ah yes, I wasn't a pilot back then, but have heard those who were there, often still have trouble with the events of that day. I do intend to make that journey one day as well."

19:46 ["Barracuda" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

23:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

23:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Barracuda, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:33 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

23:33 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:33 The ship must be in space to do that.

23:33 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:33 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

23:33 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:33 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:33 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:33 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

23:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:34 You must stand up first.
