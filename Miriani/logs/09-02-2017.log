02:06 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Welcome to your new Lore computer!]

02:06 
Congratulations on the purchase of your brand new Lore computer from LoreTech Industries.

The new line of Lore computers features several new advanced editing features over the pre-existing filing computers.

1) When editing files, you will be given the option to append your new data, rather than always overwriting.
2) You can export files from one location, and re-import them into new folders.

Note that any incoming files resulting from the use of TransLink hardware will also end up in the export memory, and must be imported into the folder of your choice. The export memory will hold files indefinitely, but they will not be accessible for viewing or editing.

Remember to check back with LoreTech Industries often for new hardware and applications.

Best Regards,
LoreTech Industries

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.

You can go southeast.
