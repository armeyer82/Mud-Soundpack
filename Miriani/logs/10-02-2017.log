You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.

16:41 ["Starlight Express" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.
