Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a compact purple microwave oven here.
You can go out.

launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

Subject: Artifact Alpha 777 - Please Read Carefully!
Author: Lily Kaise
Posted: 02:06 18 January 2317 GST
--
Please be careful to note that the Accelerator/Inserter stations for
access to Home Alpha 776 and to Artifact Alpha 776 will be going
offline at around 0240 today.
Since the Beacon for Artifact Alpha 777 has about 13 days remaining, I will
replace these Rift Accelerators with a low-
level Rift Accelerator. However, there will be no Rift Inserter so if
you don't have a Rift Drive installed, then you cannot access Artifact
Alpha 777. Note that the speed for travel will be greatly reduced but
slightly faster than if you are traveling directly via your own Rift
Drive.
Once SEAS is able to qualify to obtain faster Rift
Accelerators, we will consider reestablishing access to this area.
We have certainly observed consistent access to Artifact Alpha 777 via
the tolls collected. However we have not received but one letter from
Evenia and a phonecall from Damien Alexander who have expressed their
interest in artifacting and salvaging in Artifact alpha 777. So based
on openly expressed interest, I would say that others are not
interested yet you many have been using this area. So as they say, if
you don't express your interest in what you need or want, we really
cannot accurately gage whether or not continued support is necessary as
well.
So until further notice, once the Low-Level Rift Accelerators go offline, we'll
likely keep a beacon available in Artifact Alpha 777 with a Return Beacon just
West of Mir for awhile. You will only have access with a Rift Drie though.

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four.
