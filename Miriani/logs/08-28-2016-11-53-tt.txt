Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and Bert
the old hefty blue soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo seems to be hungry.
Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo approaches a glossy sapphire blue ceramic
felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow
into its mouth.
Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs

Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo marches out.
Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the north.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo marches out.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
The curtains close, to no applause.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
updraft.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is there a way to change the temperature
of a shower? There's a knob, but nothing shows up in the 'commands here' list
for it."
[Newbie Help] Corey Matthews transmits, "I think you're stuck with one
temperature."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That kinda sucks, considering I'm told
there is temp control. Oh well."
[Newbie Help] Corey Matthews transmits, "The description does say that but if
there is a way to control the temp I have never found it."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, that's what I wondered, thanks."
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Listen. You need to be careful.
Remember what I said.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the north.
Bert the old hefty blue soldier felo marches out.
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That's all changed."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.
Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it.
Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered
with brightly hued butterflies.
Lily Kaise pulls a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit off.
Lily Kaise puts a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit in a small suitcase.
Lily Kaise removes an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy

Lily Kaise glides out.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.
The room grows a bit more chill.

A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
l
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced
with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and
the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball

cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.
The following is a listing of current and former (player character) pilots
holding ace or veteran status.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and green aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a

You can go south and out.
sit couch
You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it.
Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily Kaise glances down at her neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer
momentarily.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Kim Saunders strolls in from the south.
Kim Saunders sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made
white and sapphire star quilt on it.
Kim Saunders removes a copy of "Into The Deep: An Account Of The Gray
Expedition" from a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.
"Interesting, so at first they traveled 0 0 and then changed heading?" Kim
Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They did but you will note further that
they made other adjusments. When I went out with others this is the heading that
Nissi used."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, a direct heading is better
than this... weird thing."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Although, if they had traveled 00 or
45 12 all the time, they would not have stumbled on this of course."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah well they were exploring for it
though too."
With a puzzled expression on her face, Kim asks: "What, they were specificly
looking for this aquarium, they knew already it existed?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No they didn't."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Oh, I already wondered."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "As far as I know they didn't."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "As far as I know they didn't initially."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think they went a bit too far East
initially too."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, like I said, they stumbled on
it, and would not have done so if they had taken another direction."
Lily Kaise nods.
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly
while dancing around it.
The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a
refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with very long dangling tendrils
and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

of drama."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, some of the things I read
here? Not sure they were meant to end up in a book."
Kim Saunders begins reading in a copy of "Into The Deep: An Account Of The Gray

You nod.
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a string of light purple plastic kelp.
Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at
the center.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So at some point when we are all still
awake, we probably should recharge. We have 41 percent charge but it's a chore
to have to charge it when it's reallylow."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Really low."
Kim Saunders nods. "Good idea."

You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I guess next oort or cluster or
something with debris chunks that we'll stop and recharge and refill."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Should have done it at that oort."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, we didn't, so we will just
find something else. Or recharge with what we hav before I go to bed."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's what I'd like to do as will go
faster with all three of us."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Agreed."

You smile.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
Listen. You need to be careful.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "This thing again...."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It gave me the creaps this morning."

You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's
nothing but vacuum all around.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Warned me that they were going to do
something really terrible. Who, are, they?"
A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with very long dangling tendrils
and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
A short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment,
then jets off.
Kim Saunders considers a copy of "Into The Deep: An Account Of The Gray
Expedition" thoughtfully.
You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?
Kim Saunders closes a copy of "Into The Deep: An Account Of The Gray
Expedition".

Lily Kaise laughs.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Darn, that is exactly what I heard
this morning."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I've heard it a few times. Crazy
rift."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "I never heard it, them, he, she,
whatever, say that before. It is scary. Who are they?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Who knows."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Just a rift entity."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "But what fun would it be for a rift
entity to just scare us senseless?"
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Because they want to test our patience
and our sense of security?"
Lily Kaise grins.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Or they are trying to warn us of
something."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Could be but I don't become
over-concerned just like that one that says they're just watching you and all
that sort of thing."
Lily Kaise grins.
Do you know what they want?
'Nope, no idea.
You say, "Nope, no idea."
Lily Kaise chuckles.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "If you know what they want, why
don't you just tell us?"

Kim Saunders strokes the soft feathers of Mandy the old hefty indigo feathered

Mandy the old hefty indigo feathered felo purrs and rubs its head against Kim's

It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its

So I have a couple weird capsule questions. First and foremost, there is
obviously no head in a capsule. How do you do that if you need to?
Second, and depending on your view, this could be more important...it's so tiny,
the life support system doesn't have much to start with, so wouldn't the air get
really, really stale after awhile?
Thanks!

Diapers.
Life support is also very pulp-y. As long as a ship has charge, life support
will be able to keep the air breathable.

This is a reality in actual space flight and space walking. Considering you are
alone though, there's no mechanical reason in the game to have this. You can
simply say you used them, and feel shame for doing so.

Too bad we can't buy them though. Especially if SSN sold them and we could send
them to other characters. It'd be better than cigs and pink bikinis.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild
flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the
planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender
sky. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and green aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
purple photocopier, a blue plastic food storage container, Desiree the little
black and white spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white foam

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible.

of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort
cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar
flotsam.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

 She is wearing a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed
on the chest and a pair of white leather boots decorated with neon purple stars.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
l
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and green aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
blue plastic food storage container, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white foam box, a clear plastic food
storage container, a small red insulated cooler, a compact red refrigerator,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a purple photocopier, an engraved silver
metal box decorated with enameled amethyst butterflies, and Shasta the big onyx
soldier felo here.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a misty rose silk night shirt. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick
