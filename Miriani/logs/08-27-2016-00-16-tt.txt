Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and
Samantha the large violet felo here.
You can go out.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Shooting Star. Welcome to Accord space."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Chemeketa"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go up and out.
(You are lying down.)
Via general sector communication, Aenea transmits, "Hello there, Chemeketa!

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and
pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a close-fitting mystic purple cropped top, a pair of tight white
denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and
a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly

Star Conquest Help: Organizations
--
Category: Game Systems
--
An organization allows a group of pilots to organize in a semi-official manner.
Pilots in an organization can:
 * Share funds for the purposes of buying organization-owned starships.
 * Contribute to a group insurance fund to cover the destruction of
organization-owned starships.
 * Have their own communicator channel.
 * Cooperatively operate temporary space stations.
 * Support large starships.
TYPES OF MEMBERS
 * Founder: There is only one founder. This is the person who created the
organization. One must have 1000 aggregate points in order to found an
organization.
 * Acting Founder: If the organization's founder plans on taking a leave of
absence, they can appoint somebody to temporarily stand in as founder of the
organization. Alternately, if the founder (or current acting founder, for that
matter) is inactive for an extended period, a trustee may request the
appointment of a new acting founder. Until the acting founder steps down or the
founder unilaterally revokes their access, they will be treated as the founder
in every way, and the actual founder's vote will be similar to a trustee's.
 * Trustees: These are people with a higher level of trust, with the ability to
propose and vote on organization actions, and buy starships and station modules
on behalf of the organization.
 * Members: Regular members can contribute to the organization and use
organization-owned ships.
REQUIREMENTS
The organization, just like an individual pilot, will gradually build up
industry, combat, and other types of points as its members work. In order to buy
a ship or a station module, not only must the trustee meet its requirements, but
the organization must as well.
Members can decide which percentage of their points they are contributing, from
0% to a maximum determined by the size of the organization, most often 10-20%.
UNITY
Organizations are free to take in any member they like belonging to any
alliance. However, once more than one alliance is involved in an organization,
unity is taken into account.
Unity affects both the rate at which an organization earns points, and the total
amount of points it has. Organizations with low unity (for instance, when its
members are at war) are very ineffective.
The more alliances you bring into your organization, the more unity will affect
it. Extremely large organizations will also suffer from disorganization, which
increases unity penalties. The most effective organization will be one
consisting of a few like-minded characters who have banded together for good,
well-roleplayed reasons.
MANAGING AN ORGANIZATION
Organization rooms are present in every capital spaceport. You can manage your
organization with the MENU command, or view its information with the INFO
command.
Organizations may choose to list themselves publicly and offer open recruitment.
You may go to your capital's organization room and apply to any organization
that has done this.
Organizations are also encouraged to use the in-game message board and other IC
means to recruit new members. Recruitment and other organization business should
NEVER occur outside of the game.
ACTIONS
Trustees can initiate and vote on certain actions that affect the organization
as a whole. The action will pass as soon as the "for" votes create a majority,
or fail as soon as an "against" vote makes a majority impossible.
The founder, however, can act as a dictator. Actions initiated by the founder
will be immediately approved. Additionally, the founder's vote will instantly
pass or veto a pending action.
ORGANIZATION POINTS
Organizations gain points much as pilots do. They do this when members that have
chosen to contribute points perform point-gaining activities.
To contribute points to your organization, visit your capital's organization
room and choose the Change Point Contribution Level option. Depending on the
size of your organization, you may set your contribution level to 5%, 10%, 20%,
or even up to 100%. This is the percentage of points that you will "lose" to
your organization. In other words, if your contribution level is 20% and you
gain 10 points from a load of salvage, you will keep 8 points while 2 points go
to your organization.
When an organization has 1000 industry points and 500 space combat points, it
can begin earning command points by contributing certain modules (salvage
processors, salvage op controllers, battle analysis scanners, and certain
others) to temporary space stations. Command points open up unique opportunities
for an organization to assist its alliance, generally with better station
modules.
ORGANIZATION FACILITIES
Each capital spaceport contains a pilot liaison office, and within this office
is an entire level devoted to organizations. This level has its own organization
management center as well as more specific facilities for both business and
pleasure. Organizations can choose to purchase access to these facilities.
STARSHIP SUPPORT
As you may be aware, an alliance sometimes limits the total number of starships
of certain models, particularly gunship- and cruiser-class ships. This is
because an alliance's funding is limited, and starships incur a constant cost in
energy, replacement parts, and routine maintenance performed by spaceport
technicians. Thus, for example, you may wish to buy a cruiser, but find that
your alliance is unwilling to construct and support any more.
However, this can be solved if your organization chooses to take up these costs
instead. Organizations can take over the costs of supporting starships, and
thereby, they can allow starships to be operated beyond the alliance's limit.
Every Conquest period, each starship's support cost will be deducted from the
organization's support fund. If the organization cannot cover its support costs,
flight control will deny launch clearance for the affected ships.
Note that, as of this writing, it is not of any benefit to support ships which
are produced in unlimited numbers. Also, it's important to note that this
affects only the maximum number of available starships, not the rate at which
they are constructed.
VASSALIZATION
Organizations with at least 2000 command points can become "thanes" of less
advanced organizations. "Thane" is an archaic word for one who is able to levy
resources from his or her vassals, but is otherwise not much elevated above
them. Vassalization should not be considered a punitive relationship or a
leadership hierarchy, but rather simply a way to more efficiently distribute
resources.
An organization can offer vassalization to a more advanced organization of the
same alliance, offering to pay 25%, 50%, or 75% of all station part costs in the
form of megacredits. In return, the vassal organization will be counted as a
full contributor on all stations that the thane organization is involved in.
This allows, for example, for a new or less advanced organization to pay for
half of the cost of an expensive salvage op controller module that it cannot buy
on its own, and then be counted as a full and equal contributor towards the
finished station.
In order for a vassal to pay anything, its percentage must work out to be a
whole number. For instance, 25% of a 1-megacredit station core is not a whole
number, and the vassal would not be able to pay anything.
Vassals gain by receiving credit for station activities, and thanes gain by
reducing their own, often much greater costs. This also allows for more
organizations to be involved in a single station. It will also allow
organizations of the same alliance to essentially ally with each other and work
together more closely.
Vassals must designate a certain number of megacredits to be usable by their
thane. Their thane cannot spend more than this amount. Vassals also have full
control over the relationship with the option to unilaterally withdraw
vassalization at any time.
Thanes have a togglable option to use vassal megacredits at all. If a thane
organization wishes to be the sole contributor to a station, it can toggle the
option off. While the option is on, all vassals will contribute their portion of
the station part cost. In the event that there are enough vassals contributing
enough to completely pay for the part, the thane organization will pay nothing.
If there are enough vassals to exceed the part's total cost, the highest
contributing vassals will be prioritized. Thanes can unilaterally remove vassals
at any time.
It is up to the organizations and their members to decide under which
circumstances they might offer, accept, and withdraw vassalization. Again, on
the face of it, the relationship is nothing more than a system of resource
distribution that acknowledges the thane organization's greater access to
advanced station parts and the past effort that was required to gain it.
ORGANIZATION REGULATIONS
Organizations may make whichever rules or regulations they like in regards to
who they accept as members, required contribution levels, whose starships they
will support, and so on. The game's staff will generally not help you enforce
these individual regulations; however, the organization may enforce them itself
in any manner which does not run afoul of the game's policies.
Strange, extreme, or unusual organization rules or actions may have in-character
consequences, as with anything else in the game.
ORGANIZATIONS AND ROLEPLAYING
Organizations are a good way to bring varied groups of people together and have
them engage in either conflict or friendship beyond the usual alliance lines.
Organizations should be a way to meet new people and experience the world with
friends and like-minded characters. Organization-wide endeavors make excellent
fodder for unique events organized by the game's staff.
An organization should strive to avoid becoming insular and isolated from the
rest of the game, and they should not be used as a shortcut to bring out-of-game
relationships into the roleplaying environment. An organization provides you
with another identity for your character and another way in which you can affect
the game world; it should not become a bubble which insulates you from everyone
else's roleplaying.
Additionally, a player should never be cajoled to join or abandon an
organization via out-of-game communications, nor should organization actions be
planned outside of the game. That sort of thing always does massive damage to
the game's roleplaying environment, and it will not be tolerated.
POLICY STATEMENT
Organizations make it easier to get around alliance and point requirements for
starships in a way that is difficult to enforce automatically. That much is
obvious. So in place of that, we'll explicitly state our intentions for how the
system is meant to be used. Working against these intentions in order to avoid
alliance/point requirements WILL be a violation of the Workarounds policy
(Policy 6).
 * Organizations are intended to consist of people who are friends or who at
least wish to actively cooperate. Organizations should not exist purely as
business transactions or as some sort of starship exchange. Additionally, nobody
should ever be paid to found, join, or leave an organization.
 * Members of an organization are expected to remain members on a semi-permanent
basis. Members should not be joining and leaving an organization very quickly,
and especially not joining multiple organizations within a short period of time.
 * Trustees are expected to remain trustees on a semi-permanent basis. Trustees
WILL NOT be promoted just long enough to buy a ship, and then demoted. Other
players WILL NOT be paid or otherwise cajoled to join an organization and become
a trustee just long enough to buy a new ship for it.
 * Again, organizations should never plan or recruit outside of the game. This
is covered in greater detail under Policy 9: Metagaming.

Hello Johann and Sean,
First please don't share the information below with others as this
is not a planned expedition.
I need to go out to the Aquarium to get a shell for my org. I am
limited on time to be able to be awake to fly my platform for the
better part of each day and my window is up around September 5th so
I need to allow for enough time to travel to and from prior to
then. in order to plan for enough time, I should leave no later
than Monday, August 29th. and preferably over this coming weekend.
Having said this, I want to invite a few to come along and we can
share the eggs. I have all of the varieties of fish but I do want
to claim one of the dark gray snapper eggs. The rest would be up
to the crew to share. I might get another Seastar if I see a color
I don't have though.
If either or both of you would like to come along with Shule and I
and perhaps a couple of others, please let me know what day/time
from after 2359 on Friday, August 26th on until Monday latest.
We'll be flying my Exploration Platform, William Dove. There are
crew quarters available for 4 additional persons besides Shule and
myself or 4 couples as it can accomodate ten crew. However I'm
not particularly interested in taking along 8 more crew. If you
have someone in mind you would like to invite, if they're not going
to room with you, bear in mind that we may have to get organized as
to who rooms where if they are not a part of a couple.
As for Shule and I, we're generally able to fly from about noon GST
until around 0500 the next day but sometimes as late as 1400 on.
We'd like to keep flying so if either you or Sean are typically
awake from around 0500 until 1300, that would be very helpful but
not required. I generally just reduce trim while sleeping so we're
still moving.
Let me know and if you have any thoughts, concerns or whatever.
Best regards,
Lily Kaise

Shule. Here is the report I promised you. I hope at the very least it makes it
so that the League doesn't catch you by surprise.
First, the meeting point. IF you are able, meet at the torus, with a secondary
meeting point at Earth if the Torus is inaccessible. Crew large ships first,
then small ships if we are able. Let the larger ships take care of larger
targets, and smaller ships take care of smaller targets. I know it's possible to
beat a larger ship with a smaller, but it's more efficient this way.
The largest ship in the sector has command of the fleet and if they tell a
smaller ship to do something, the smaller ship should listen.
IF two or more ships are engaging the same target, don't go to where the enemy
has just been, or you will open yourself to friendly fire. I know it's not
always possible, but try to stay on different z-axis coordinates than your
allies, that will avoid unnecessary blockages and could cause ships to get hit.
I would like to see this done with all the alliances and have designated z-axis
points for each, but I seriously doubt I can get everyone to go along with that.
If the enemy is an ifs fleet, please refer to the posts about ifs priority on
this board. If you are fighting ifs, it is best to have two or more larger ships
to take turns taking the lrl damage.
I would love to have invasion drills, but my previous attempts to implement them
have been unsuccessful, however, the better prepared we are, the harder it will
be for us to be subjugated again.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
+m'p3ncv+^d!]q$Hh@Q)i7:\y9]b8J,RI&_wk'lU
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Greetings Johann,
I appreciate the report you sent me detailing the League's defence plan. There
are some very good points, but I also have some questions.
First of all, I like the idea of using the Torus as a staging point. It is the
most heavily armoured station and doesn't seem to be attacked often. The capital
planets as a second staging point also makes sense.
I do, however, have some questions. In the event of a large invasion, how many
ships and what class of ships do you envision as an ideal response? Also, if we
respond with more than one of the largest ships in the sector, e.g. two or more
cruisers, who has command of the fleet? 
In terms of actual combat, I think if we place too many limitations, we may
cause pilots to lose their concentration thereby risking ships and their crew.
Having fought in wasps launched from a morningstar, I know it can get cluttered.
However, if I have to consider that I can't move certain places because of the Z
axis I've been assigned, that extra  second could result in my ship
unnecessarily getting hit as well as limiting my options in terms of were I can
move. I do, however, think it is a good idea to pair big ships with small ships
and attack the same ship. For example, a gunship and a destroyer attacking the
same ship could be very useful and efficient. In fact, that destroyer could just
follow that same gunship around, attacking everything it does. Those are my
thoughts so far. I look forward to receiving your comments and thoughts as well.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Comet Surface.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Metal-rich Asteroid Surface.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I've actually seen them in the 60s but
that's been quite awhile."
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yikes."

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.
The following is a listing of current and former (player character) pilots
holding ace or veteran status.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

an antique red birch table from New Earth
The red birch of this deceptively simple four-foot-long rectangular antique
table is finely grained and highly polished to make the subtle variations in
color stand out. In the New Earth Colonial style, the legs are slim and straight
but arch gracefully into underside braces for the table top. The table top
itself has been left undecorated, the better to show off the beautiful grain of
the wood.
There is nothing on there.

Between the windows on each side of this section of corridor are two arches
perhaps twenty feet high, each one containing a small green tree with lacy
leaves. The trees grow from beneath the floor, their slender, dark brown trunks
emerging from decorative circular grates. While most of the illumination here is
provided by the lighted walls, tiny star-like lights twinkle from the boughs of
the trees. Three doorways on the outer side of the corridor lead to small shops,
one selling souvenirs, the second identified by a brightly lit twinkling sign as
'Holiday Ornamentation,' and the third named 'The Ontological Felo,' which has
articles of oddly shaped clothing in a small display window next to the doorway.
You can go northeast and southwest.

I am greateful for all the work that is done on this, for the experiments and
the work involved in stations. For new pilots, I really do feel that a points
paying salvage site is crucial, so it sounds like 134 and 285 are important in
different ways to me.

I guess the biggest difference, as I've tried expelling out here, and can still
make points faster at 134, if it were up, is for newer pilots who can't get a
grapple that will do grade 40-60 debris like what is at 285. I understand the
issues brought up about dead batteries, sleeping pilots, things like that. It is
definitely a valid point. But I already miss 134. It's nice to be able to
salvage in a sector that I don't find a roid in, but 134 was much easier and
less time consuming for the points. Could I go out there on my own? Yeah, I
could. But without an accelerator, the time spent traveling both directions so I
can drop one load at a local salvage station more than makes up for the time I'd
save on the shipwrecks out there.

Local sectors for cadets, Orion has grade 20 and so on. I guess the point is, be
glad we have something. There are also other ways of making industry, hauling
roids, Tesla and so on.

Hi,
there are a big number of sectors with debris in it connected to the beacon
network. Maybe it's worth trying salvaging in them and see what they are like.
Belt of orion is but one of them, the entire tesla pipe is filled with debris,
every alliance has sectors with debris. Battle of mir only has grade 0 and 10
shipwrecks, only small ones and 1 per sector, it's not great I admit.
If after a while it turns out that missing 134 is a big issue, we can revisit
this and I would be willing to make modules available to set up at least a
beacon and accelerators, but let's try a little while without it first?
Good luck with the continued experiments.
Kim

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, I don't like salvage at 285. I
really do miss 134. For two hours work, I could make about 65 points out at 134.
Out here, I make about 25 points in that time. Payout is about the same. This is
expelling at 285 and not expelling at 134, which has some to do with the time
spent, but man! I do miss 134."
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I am seriously considering
eating the rest of this toll and grabbing the roid hauler to go out to the out

kicking my behind."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Two hours got me a full load
using the compressor with grade 40-60 stuff. I expelled, and got 25 points out
of it. I could have gotten more than twice that at 134 if it were up, and almost
the same number of points and skads more cash with roids in the same time."

[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yup, sure can."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Now that's pretty cool."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Think about it. Everywhere you
find roids, will always be debris of some kind."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It would be if the payout was
better. It works to salvage in a sector you don't find a roid in, but I
personally won't be coming back out here just for salvaging."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, if you can't get a
grapple that'll do grade 40-60, you're kinda screwed."

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Centauri Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
purple photocopier, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Kim Saunders
She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and applied with red lipstick, and occasionally part to
reveal a set of slightly yellowed teeth. Pink blush is applied to her cheeks.
Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are green and wide, and
enhanced with two-shade shimmery green eyeliner. Her mid-back length, slightly
curly hair is dark blonde and parted on the side and smoothed back behind her
ears. She has neatly trimmed painted glittery silver fingernails. She has a
large black satin bow in her hair. She has a tiny birthmark on her neck.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved cream silk blouse with a round neckline, an
expensive silver watch with diamond accents, a flowing sapphire silk skirt, and
a pair of strappy light green high-heeled sandals. She is also wearing a light
purple cotton drawstring purse, a metallic green touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster, a delicate ring of silver wire and small pink quartz
crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace, and a wrist-mounted chronometer. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
-}Z@iE:o&IEx~=W.sgRj@}"AAel2'bE8&t?qEc;N
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Let's hope we find that shell for
you."

You grin.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
beats its claws together.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok well it will be awhile as I think I
need at least 500 command so no hurry at this time. I should get the other
points needed prior to then but am like 1 percent there for command haha."
Lily Kaise laughs.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "How much command do you have now?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "5."
Lily Kaise laughs.

You laugh.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Xenology seems to be a winner and
salvage."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, it's slow work."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's ok."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "The BAS probably would be a winner
too."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I'm not on the BAS so hopefully
once I'm vassalized Mel will let Seas on that one."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Holy sh...uh, already 3000
industry?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yup."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I've worked my butt off and of course
used the tesla bucks I've earned."
Mandy the old hefty indigo feathered felo rears up and plants both pairs of
forelegs on Kim Saunders's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "When you have the megacredits to
contribute, you will be on the BAS, because we will sort that vasselization."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Until that time, we will just have
to improvise."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well if there's room for the stealth on
the Bas, that might work in the interim."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Maybe Starseekers can stand down
from the BAS for a month or 2 to get you a chance."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Aww no no wouldn't want you to."
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws
snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.
Kim Saunders laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But yeah I can buy the batteries now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Both the large and the Fission Breeder
reactor."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "You can buy the reactors with 3000."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "When we are back I will talk it over
with Melinda. Starseekers has enough stations it's on."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But as I say if the stealth would fit on
there, I could do that."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't think it does."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ah ok."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If it does, it probably is already
on there. And Melinda told me Invaders will be in on it too."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I believe that battle scanner
already takes 140 or 145 power."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The problem is megacredits though all of
the orgs were getting them and the only one I got was the other day so far."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, the more advanced the org is,
the faster it will earn megacredits, unfortunately."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I guess I have to get to some certain
level and who knows exactly what that is."
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well Old Earth Rome wasn't built in one
day... so."
Lily Kaise grins.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Your first goal should be 100
command."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Well first is 10 so I can have an
office!"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "When you have that, you can set up a
scoop station."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Then 100."
Lily Kaise grins.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, for the office you are
halfway."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "At 100 I can get the Range Office too
plus the sim and the rental. I really don't need the rental but I'll fully equip
the org."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "And really, what do you need an
office for, other than official org stationary. You have no members to send
terminal notices to?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Naa but it's just a little prestige and
they aren't expensive."
Lily Kaise grins.
Kim Saunders grins.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Are you sure you don't'want any
members?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think they're only 100 mil."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I never said I don't want. Jus

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I see."
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a plastic flower with red petals.

particulars and things can and will likely change."

Lily says to Kim, "Have you read the book that Jonathan Reets wrote about the
Gray expedition?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's out of print but I have one copy."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I did, a long time ago. Darn, I
should have picked it up from my apartment."

I will as tedious as it is."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I might do that along the way."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "How far out is the aquarium anyway?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll put it on the coffee table in
here."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "There is a library case in the cabinet
in the living quarters area too with more books."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "All right."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I seem to remember about 63 LTC."
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "I never remember
what 63 ltc actually is..."
Kim Saunders grins.
A medium-sized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a
blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate
flag.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It would be about 7.74 times 63."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Given that an LTC is equivalent to
approximately 7.74 Light-Years."

Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Too bad the flow isn't in our favor
too!"
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then
jets off.
'So about 487 light years and some change.
You say, "So about 487 light years and some change."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim looks thoughtful for a moment: "7.7 times 63, hmm, 7 times 60 is uh 420, 7
times 3 is 21 makes 441 and throw the rest in my hat... and uh, Shule gave the
answer already."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Whereas andy's is about 301 or so

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It was my weakest subject in
school."
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So the only issue which is likely to get
you into trouble at the aquarium is that you absolutely s should not promote any
bodily fluids while in the aquarium nor in your spacesuit. Makes sense but not
to ahem... some."
Lily Kaise laughs.
"You can't even do that from within a spacesuit, not without damaging it?" Kim
Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Right."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "But others... you know would think about
that right?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Not that I am quite certain I know
why we would need bodily fluids in an aquarium full of fish."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "You did mention sample containers."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well on one trip two did one drew blood
and the other urinated and both were permanently affected."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its
many tendrils.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Drawing blood, while in a spacesuit?
Every idiot knows you can throw that thing away after doing something like
that?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think one who was a guy retired but
Raechel smithson, I think that is who it was, has a cough that I suppose she
will never get rid of."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Huh yeah."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Right."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hey Kim, have you left yet?"
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They also did it while in the water so
that is how they became contaminated."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild
flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the
planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender
sky. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a

Lily Kaise sighs.
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "I don't think they exist here?"

A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by

have something to do with one another?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah one can certainly make an
association."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Of course too Keegan is in total
denial."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If it is true, it would make sense
why Keegan refused to give out the name. They are friends I thik."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Think."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh yeah."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Keegan depends a lot on Cesar."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He's in Cesar's org and they pat one
another on the back."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If Ather did not have an org of his
own, he'd join them."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "The only reason they did not join
Ather is probably called unity."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Uh no I don't think so. Ather is not
fond of Fringe. Fringe are the least tolerable to Ather. I think it's more of a
comradery thing because they all go back a number of years."
Kim Saunders laughs. "Rhyme that together with how Ather hangs with those 2
fringers all the time, and I think he even once mentioned prefering an alliance
with the fringe over one with the League."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No no it's the opposite but Ather
doesn't want any alliance with any other alliance."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He absolutely doesn't like Fringe."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That is also true."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But I will attempt to rock his boat if
I'm still Voice at some point. I'm just not very happy with how rude League are
being towards us."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "He does not trust the mutuality
either, so his best friends are members of alliances he dislikes strongly, yeah
that makes sense all right."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "With Mutuality though it's more the
Council."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not the pilots."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Sheesh we're about halfway to the

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "How dismal."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, and this is the accelerator."

Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "What's our heading going to be from

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I wonder which one they put on too."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We'll go to the out of comms asteroid
cluster and our heading will be 31 4."

borns which we then sort out to go to the aquarium sttion."

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "He was more than a little unstable,
I would say."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Not that I am an expert, but during
the one trip I was on where he was, he barely slept for several days and did not
see sense even when it stared him in the face."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well yeah but there are plenty of
unstable pilots who get away with it day I in and day out."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah he rarely slept that's true."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But I really wonder what happened to put
him over the edge."

government gets enough, or maybe he realized he had to do something, who knows."

Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "I have seen him go all, weird,
unable to speak or do anything for 10 minutes and be all upset, just because I
told him in a friendly way why I was not coming on his aquarium trip. We had to
delay the beacons he wanted to do, and if Berry, now Elizabeth, had not been
there?"
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Still though, League will never admit
that they have some who also shouldn't have been accepted as pilots. They like
to point at us for our issues and our government finally saying enough was
enough."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think they have kept it quiet
because, all in all, he is not a bad person. Unusual, wacky, but not mean, like
some pilots are."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, we have issues, I think every
pilot core has them."

You nod.
Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah but my point is I've geen subjected
so often to the jeers on General about AEU and exceptional pilots and that sort
of thing and how Melinda says we et our own and htings like that when they've
been horrible to their own at times. How about that one awhile back and the Salt
Lick. I don't know all of it but apparently she retired because they humilated
her so much."
'wow!
You exclaim, "Wow!"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, if one of theirs goes too far,
Nissi, Melinda and others instantly pounce. Or Akemi beats them up, with help,
then strands them, afterwards vanishing for a few weeks on a trip. I don't know
anything about a salt lick."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Except I have seen one standing in
their lounge for some reason."
'Yeah, and yet they talkabout how we supposedly made Nils retire.
You say, "Yeah, and yet they talkabout how we supposedly made Nils retire."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah my point exactly."
'And forced her out of office.
You say, "And forced her out of office."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am confused, we made Nils retire?
I always understood it that she ran, she definitely left office long before we
could vote her out."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I wasn't even around when all of that
went down too as I was off on that e expedition last Fall."
'There are those of the League and Fringe who say that we forced Nils out of
office.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Heck we were pretty mild towards Tatiana
too. We only responded to her when she attacked us over our channel."
You say, "There are those of the League and Fringe who say that we forced Nils
out of office."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They will say anything because they
can."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It doesn't have to be true."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Nils joined the pirates, after she
left office, I don't remember all of it but I am fairly certain we never forced
her out. And that happened after that long expedition. So if someone says that,
they are crazy."
'Exactly
You say, "Exactly."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Who says such a thing?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's exactly how I understand it and
she went to the pirates while we were still out there."

You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.
Kim says to Lily, "That last thing is not true at all."

don't remember.

expedition on Nissi's imperator?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yes."
'Were you guys back when we had the fight in Campeche?
You ask, "Were you guys back when we had the fight in Campeche?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Sorry, you definitely remember
wrong. She was still voice when Annie retired. And Annie was on that trip, she
retired a day or 2 after you guys returned."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll lookup the news thing."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I remember her announcing Annie had
retired, and after Annie retired Ather, Nils, Anfisa, Nissi and Pierre went to
find Aria VII."
'Oh, then yeah, you must have been gone then. Fringe, League and AEu enaged
pirates at Campeche and her gunship was seen.

Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I was not around for that. But I
remember clearly that the whole thing about Takana's conversation with Kelsey
and what was said only came out after the Aria VII discovery. And that was when
Nils escaped and Takana ended in prison."
Kim Saunders takes a sip of a two liter bottle of cola.

Kim says to Lily, "While you were gone, Nils asked the liaison office to issue a
second copy of that chart, and we had to wait for Anfisa to return from that
trip, because she was the only one who could read it. When you guys returned,
Annie was asked to return her copy of that chart which she had apparently
refused so far. But while you and her were on that trip, the rest of us voted on
the matter and decided she had to return it and we would ask Anfisa to read it.
So, annie was not happy she had to give that chart back to the core, and retired
over the matter. After that Aria VII was found, and Nils and Nissi were on that
expedition and they ended up with a sunstroke and had to be rushed back for
treatment. So Nils can't have escaped to the pirates before you returned from
the trip, unless you were also on another trip around that time that I am not
aware of."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "At least we're traveling at a reasonable
speed now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah Annie retired around October 23rd.
Or there abouts."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That could be right. That is when I
became the founder of Starseekers."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But events did occur prior to November
14th when they issued the arrest warrant for Nils and I thought things occurred
while we were just returning."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway, all alliances have their black
sheep which was my original point and I know that we are no more harsh than
other alliances."
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, it just feels as if the AEU
has had it worse than any other for the last few years."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah it does as I remember so many bad
things. I have wondered about Cesar why he left for a long time and then
suddenly returned all so powerful."
'Yeah, but at least it's not the AEU that's getting negative attention right
now.
You say, "Yeah, but at least it's not the AEU that's getting negative attention
right now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "For sure."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Nissi blames Ather for some of the
trouble we are in. Apparently the AEU once upon a time had a full alliance with
both the League and the Fringe, and Ather talked pilots back then into ending
those alliances and falling back to a non agression pact. Nissi's words were
something like, and when the slaver incident happened, the AEU was worse off
because no one had their back."
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
beats its claws together.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "'yeah you said that and yes there were
full alliances and of course we had at least a NAP with Mutuality."
'Why is Ather so against alliances with other alliances?
You ask, "Why is Ather so against alliances with other alliances?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "As for Cesar, I have this feeling
the truth is coming out within the next few days, no matter how much Keegan and
Cesar don't want it to."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We've definitely alienated ourselves."
'ok, that came outkind of weird.
You say, "Ok, that came outkind of weird."
'Yeah, I'm sure it is.
You say, "Yeah, I'm sure it is."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He's paranoid about technology."
Kim says to you in a New Bristol accent, "Search me. I wish I knew. I am sure he
has a totally wonderful reason for it but it's one of those only ather can
understand."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Laugh 'technology? Ha ha ha."
Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Oops."
Kim Saunders laughs. "Technology? Ha ha ha."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He claimed that Mutuality stole tech
from the AEU and of course that is one real contention on the part of the
Council."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Mutuality does wish they could get the
Revo."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Pierre even said that to me."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Personally I don't care. I think we
should all share our technology except with the Outsiders of course!"
'I agree with you.
You say, "I agree with you."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, but what would the League or
the Fringe want to steal from us? Have the mutuality only stolen from us? And
have we not murdered loads of unregs once upon a time, not even so far in the
past. All sides surely have done things to one another once, those wars between
alliances once upon a time... No one is perfect."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And tI could be wrong, but other
alliances have the revo, so if the mutuality had not broken the NAP, they would
still have it too."
Kim Saunders finishes off a side of cheese fries.
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah so the other alliances are pretty
much laughing at us for being such loners."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "I would say though that Johann
approaching Shule is a good thing as he expressed that the League would rather
work with us than Fringe right Shule?"
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think if we expressed a good
proposal, the League might accept or at least seriously consider an alliance
with us."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So there's some hint of confidence
there."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Nissi would consider it, I think.
Melinda probably too."
'What Johann said to me was that he couldn't trust the Fringe to consider his
plan.
You say, "What Johann said to me was that he couldn't trust the Fringe to
consider his plan."
'or carry it out.
You say, "Or carry it out."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well dunno about Nicollette though."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But hopefully she would go along with
the others."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "This is the thing though. If the
rest of us were in favour of an alliance and the government gave the support,
Ather can object and refuse whatever he wants. He is only 1 person."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Apparently everyone for a long time
followed his lead though and did not question him enough, or so I was told."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "My thoughts exactly. I get along
tolerably with Ather but I would risk his hating me forever but I'm willing to
do it because I don't agree with his viewpoint."
'Well, he is the only active ace pilot in the AEU.
You say, "Well, he is the only active ace pilot in the AEU."
Kim Saunders grins.
'So, I think people may have just followed his lead because of that.
You say, "So, I think people may have just followed his lead because of that."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't care whether he likes or
dislikes me really."
'Neither do I.
You say, "Neither do I."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "And he's also been around longer than
anyone and you know how it is."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Me either."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Cesar is also a fringe ace pilot,
but now he is grounded."
'rue enough
You say, "Rue enough."
'er, true
You say, "Er, true."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anything he has ever done for me I had
to pay a steep price for so i'd still do that. Nothing really lost there."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Being an ace pilot does not mean you
are always right and that yu can do whatever you want."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it
withdraws.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It sure doesn't. Look at Cesar hehe."
nod and chuckle
You nod and chuckle.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Ace sure doesn't certify good
character!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "At any rate, if we could draft and write
a good proposal for an alliance with League, I'm willing to put to a vote and
we'll just out-number Ather and it will be done."
Kim Saunders nods.
'Well, and the government as to agree too.
You say, "Well, and the government as to agree too."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "We should first finish something
else though."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yes we have a couple of things to finish
first."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "That is, what is happening with our
medical fund?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I want us to meet to decide on a
final proposal and then work with the Government to decide how to initiate it
and so on."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'd like to do that next month and not
at the end of the month."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Also, We need to discuss Johann's
proposal."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "What proposal is this?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I will be requesting a meeting
shortly after we get back."
Lily looks at Shule.
'Hang on
You say, "Hang on."
read last league
--
Shule. Here is the report I promised you. I hope at the very least it makes it
so that the League doesn't catch you by surprise.
First, the meeting point. IF you are able, meet at the torus, with a secondary
meeting point at Earth if the Torus is inaccessible. Crew large ships first,
then small ships if we are able. Let the larger ships take care of larger
targets, and smaller ships take care of smaller targets. I know it's possible to
beat a larger ship with a smaller, but it's more efficient this way.
The largest ship in the sector has command of the fleet and if they tell a
smaller ship to do something, the smaller ship should listen.
IF two or more ships are engaging the same target, don't go to where the enemy
has just been, or you will open yourself to friendly fire. I know it's not
always possible, but try to stay on different z-axis coordinates than your
allies, that will avoid unnecessary blockages and could cause ships to get hit.
I would like to see this done with all the alliances and have designated z-axis
points for each, but I seriously doubt I can get everyone to go along with that.
If the enemy is an ifs fleet, please refer to the posts about ifs priority on
this board. If you are fighting ifs, it is best to have two or more larger ships
to take turns taking the lrl damage.
I would love to have invasion drills, but my previous attempts to implement them
have been unsuccessful, however, the better prepared we are, the harder it will
be for us to be subjugated again.

You give a thick cream piece of paper with an official header reading "From the
League Space Defense Captain" to Kim Saunders.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, better either do it before the
6th, or after the 13th, or chances are pretty high I won't make it."
-kim Take a peek at that.
You say to Kim, "Take a peek at that."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok probably after the 13th as I have
some personal things going on too from the 6th on."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I won't be as active as many hours
per day as I need to take care of personal business."
Kim Saunders gives you a thick cream piece of paper with an official header

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We already sent questions back to Johann
and was funny that Shule and I had the same ones almost exactly."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "We are not military, but it surely
would be a good idea to shake up and improve the response to invasions a bit."
Lily Kaise nods.

You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I also consider that his plan is
contingent upon having far more active pilots too."

You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I am in favor of having a centrlized
point to stage. I hedge though because if we do that, then therein could be

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Sounds like a plan."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Accord might also be a reasonable
place, except they have no garage, and their docking bays are already
overflowing with ships."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Right and they have no access from the
ITPN."
Two skeletons riding skeletal horses draw alongside the hovertruck bed briefly
and stare across at you, blue points of light glittering in their empty

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That too."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I would like to bring Ather in on this

would be good to get his input."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Johann has been around quite a while
though, yet I never heard of him until 2 months ago or something."
'The other thing to consider is making sure we can get acess to the ships we put

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Also a pilot returning after a long
absence."

You nod to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I saw his org but I don't know anything
about him."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Well we can't launch other Alliance
ships though without a qualified pilot aboard?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The combat ships so dunno if keys would
be that much of an issue."
'No, but we have our own ships there and the owner isn't there...
You say, "No, but we have our own ships there and the owner isn't there..."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well that is what we would have to
establish."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "True, but if we put a pulsare or a
cruiser out there that is AEU, all qualified AEU pilots should have a key for
that ship."
'Like if it's my gunship there, and I'm not awake.
You say, "Like if it's my gunship there, and I'm not awake."

distributing keys because that is why I bought them and put them in service."
'Neither do I.
You say, "Neither do I."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Shule does have a key to all of my
combat ships I think and I wouldn't mind giving them to any qualified pilot such
as yourself Kim."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and an
amber glowing interior pulsates gently.
nod
You nod.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Also, I think, if a ship belongs to
an org and a member were to rent it, they were qualified to launch it if they
meet the other requirements, like the points and lock evasions."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "So there is some room to work with."
Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I also have a key to his Cruiser but not
qualified."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I couldn't launch it."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am also not yet cruiser
qualified."
'I think I might be.
You say, "I think I might be."
Kim Saunders laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But someday we hopefully will be and
whenever am I would distribute keys."

who are qualified though where I cringe a little if they had keys."

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If for some reason I'd have to let

You say, "Well, he could rent and launch the org cruiser."

You shiver.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't consider myself a great
pilot by any stretch of the imagination. But at least I do have order of ships
down and that sort of thing."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I've actually stopped insuring certain
of my combat shps. The way the insurance works is you end up paying them back.
So I'd rather jsut replace it myself."
Kim says to Lily, "You have the credits to do that. Not everyone is so lucky."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I know but it's something to work
towards."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, but I will have to work like a
beast for a year."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If I didn't, yes insurance would be
worthwhile."

Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I don't remember that far back
either!"
'I don't remember either.
You say, "I don't remember either."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I know I made the new mod transport
pretty tough to rent. And the destruction fee on it is high too, but it's loaded
with upgrades. I want it to be available but I did not want someone to go oh,
nice, let's play with this shippy for a while."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Once Melinda and Nissi are finished
experimenting, I hope we can get that artifacting trip off the ground."
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Star Conquest Help: Pilot Titles
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Pilots can hold a number of titles which may appear in the WHO command, or
simply be referred to in character by others.
Cadet: Cadets are, basically, newbies. ICly, these are pilots who have just been
granted a license and are flying provisionally pending final approval from their
flight school. If the pilot conducts her- or himself well during this
probationary period, they are granted a full license -- something other pilots
refer to as "graduating." OOCly, a cadet is a player who has not yet submitted
an acceptable character profile.
Pilot: This title is also available, and is meant to be understood as "full
pilot." The vast majority of playable characters are regular pilots, so this
title does not say anything much about a character.
Ace: Aces are pilots who have been recognized for exceptional combat prowess and
leadership. This title is typically awarded only after periods of serious
fighting during which a handful of pilots distinguish themselves in combat. This
is mostly just a title, but ace pilots receive a bit of special consideration,
such as free starship support.
Veteran: Veterans are similar to ace pilots, but are long-term characters who
have fought in several serious conflicts. New characters will generally never be
approved for veteran status.
Other titles may be granted for performing an unusual action or participating in
an event, such as "Drydock Defender." The IC/OOC barrier is a bit flimsy here,
but you may regard these titles as appearing on your communicator display or
simply being something that person is known for -- whichever makes more sense.
You can change your own active title with the TITLE command.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and layer of gravel on the floor creates
a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the center is
guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon green
plastic plant waves around, anchored into the gravel. A large goldfish and
several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

you find yourself back in the starship.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
