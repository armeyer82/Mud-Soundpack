Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, and a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top
here.

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Morris? Pink socks?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Did you?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't wear pink."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And all my socks are white
with only two exceptions. One black pair and one pair of navy dress socks."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, the ones they're
showing look rather orange to me, not pink. You need glasses?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I had you looking though,
that's awesome."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looking?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "At what did you have me look
that I was not already seeing?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Look at how few people are
around, and us two sat watching SSN."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, and how do you figure
into this equation? I've been watching SSN for awhile, in fact, possibly before
you were. So tell me...how did you make me do anything?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And, there was a pink option
too."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I didn't know you were still
watching though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't have anything else to
do at the moment, stop trying to figure out what I'm doing or not doing. I did
not order pink socks, and I was already watching SSN."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, we're not the only
show in town, you know."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Woo, look at you."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Assuming I think that, just
wow."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow, you mean you're not the
only one who makes assumptions? Imagine that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Wow, we're a bit touchy today
aren't we?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We? Who is this we you speak
of?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton sighs.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You know, I think I'll go to
sleep for a bit."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rest well."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyone know what a cotton lawn
is? Sounds like you have cotton growing in your yard instead of grass..."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "I've no idea."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "What's everyone up to?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lying on my couch watching SSN
for fun."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Flying in the bubble. What're
you up to?"
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Lying on my couch with three
felo."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "That sounds very relaxing."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Oh it is."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Is it as relaxing as a hot
tub?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "This commercial always makes me
laugh."

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is

simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
4h$8{<9XJ\-QVA([x`%Q|Wn<.QML?x+#bn|=x>qS
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
