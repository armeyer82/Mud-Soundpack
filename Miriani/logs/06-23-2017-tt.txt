-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

rK[lg=9y*9\Xq<R_+{!DsU+<IaiH}2Kp}P=IGT>s
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

still on the bottom. We'll still try of course, just don't be surprised if it
still stays low."

artifacting run at one of the farther alien artifacting fields like hall of
pain, chamber of wrath etc."

the bubble until I had to go back for lack of charge. But in something like a
Void Piercer that actually gives you a ton of time to artifact."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Even nicer these days,
because of the accelerators, and being able to still talk on comms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, you can take a
better ship along. With the artifacting expeditions we tended to run down the
line, we generally used a recharging station with a passive beacon onboard and a

lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead

Katina Faye
She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has caramel skin. Her body is voluptuous with attractively curved hips and
shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and a large bust. Her face is
heart-shaped and lovely, with a button nose and elegant fine chin. Her lips are
full soft and applied with strawberry-flavored lipstick, and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes
are hazel and almond-shaped, and enhanced with black eyeshadow. Her
waist-length, straight hair is shiny black and hanging in a smooth fall, the
ends slightly curled under. She has oval light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a finely crafted diamond choker, a black silk tanktop, a
delicate chain of tiny aquamarines around her waist, a pair of skinny blue
lowrise jeans with black and sapphire blue jeweled teardrops on the front and
back pockets, and a pair of black silk stilettos. She is also wearing a mood
ring, a pair of earrings with delicate diamond rosebuds suspended from tiny
silver studs, a black silk handbag embroidered with crimson dragonflies, and a
pair of magnificent glossy dark brown eagle wings. Her head, face, both eyes,
both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

Hey Nissi, I had a great time during this last Expedition. I sure wish that I
could be available moreso. Shule and I are still interested in another trek to
wherever! So please let either of us know when to be ready to roll out! I think
I have covered most aspects of infrastructure which needs to be amintained for
our newer pilots. Would love to grab some felo chow at the last moment plus a
couple other things. However, none of that is absolutely necessary and we're
ready to fly after resetting our robots whenever you are. Thank you for the last
Amazing trek out yonder! As Ather hinted though I would love to go attempt to
meet those clans above Farport or anywhere you would love to go. Oh by the way,
I was amused by Aisling who wanted to make it a project out of not wanting to
invite me on her next project. I'd love to experience a Genship but I consider
Aisling to be a rather unstable individual from past experience. Therefore, it
does not sadden me in the least to be unwelcomed by her. - Lily

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

where they are. I have plans for them."

using regular sightseers on a platform."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I thought about doing it, but
decided to be patient and use long ranged ones."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "But for exploration, there's
so much I can't get, trading trips and things, fine, but actual exploration? Not
yet."

the ship I've done most of my exploration in. It's reliable, and doesn't drift
all that much."

forecaster or QE yet."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In saying that though. I
also spent like a month in a mod transport. So really. It depends what you need
and want."

you are going on some huge trip."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I wanna get a turbine on this thing
heh."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "A what on what?"

sightseer."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I wish I had a clue how much
benefit you get from those, in the rift."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What does the turbine do?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's the flowmill charge turbine.
Basically it augments your charge while you are int he rift so that you have a
large more charge while you are rifting."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Extends your charge, but only
in the rift, and the faster you go, the better it works, great for capsules."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Love that idea."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Keep in mind that it's not actually
charging the battery, just using power from the turbine to assist in powering
your systems, which results in you having a higher overall charge."

right?

[General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "What kind of mission is the
one where you collect RATS antennae? He said ground, but it doesn't seem like
that's right."
[MTTS] Squidmind: You're welcome to attempt them. But if you pull it off, tell
us exactly how so we can fix it! That's what overdrivens boil down to.
[MTTS] andawn: Wait, so they're ment to never be done?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Indeed!
[MTTS] nadira: Then, if they are not meant to be done, why do they exist? Or
maybe that is a stupid question?
[General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Never mind, I figured it
out."
[MTTS] andawn: I was thinking the same thing.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Because if they're ever accomplished, then we know something
about the system can be exploited, and then we can patch that up and fix the
combat system gamewide.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Sounds sort of dystopian, doesn't it?
[MTTS] andawn: Kinda.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I like it. But then, I'm strange.
[MTTS] andawn: So do I. It's called, bug finding.
[MTTS] nadira: Right.
[MTTS] andawn: I know once I axxidentally typed 5 instead of four when I had no
idea what I was doing. That was, not fun.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Hey, if it helps to improve the combat system, or patch up any
issues, I'm completely down with the idea. This game's combat is amazing.
[MTTS] andawn: It is.
[MTTS] davetaylor: It is. Sometimes it's actually too intensive for me, and I've
ended up going to bed with a bad back and head ache, but most of the time it's
fun.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Let's not go too far. This combat system is old enough to vote
and originated on a graphing calculator.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Maybe so, but it kicks butt over most of the combat out there
in other games.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed.
[MTTS] andawn: Agreed.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Just proves my point that old code, is sometimes better than
new shiny code.
[MTTS] andawn: I prefer vector-baced locking to coordinate-baced locking, even
though I did used to use coordinate things.
[MTTS] andawn: Slightly off topic, but it's amazing just how different sc and sc
clasic are.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Sometimes I forget everything we've redone or added since
reopening. It's a very different game these days.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Did Classic come back again? I never did get chance to see
it.
[MTTS] andawn: I started here, and I thought, wahat was sc like. Found the info
for clasic, connected, and was like, wait, where did my tracking go? Where did
my cannons go? Chainguns? But I love how the story backs up all these changed
with ic reasons.
[MTTS] Butchulla: You guys have done and still do an amazing job. I come back
day after day, for that exact reason. This is a hell of a good game.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I am so invested in this game, there's always something to
work towards, that's worth doing the work for.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It's been up for some time. But it occasionally breaks and we
pay absolutely no attention to it. It's mostly there as a curiosity. I don't
think anyone really plays it.
[MTTS] andawn: I do, actually. Sometimes, anyway. Just because I like comparing
the two.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Last time I tried it was during the hosting problem, I think
I lost the info.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Port 7888, I think.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Thanks.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Only trouble I have is figuring out the date in game, that
sometimes causes slight disasters.
[MTTS] andawn: I just run off the date that I am on now.
[MTTS] Butchulla: For me, the game date changes at...I think 10 AM my time, so
that can confuse things. I sorta wish we had something that showed the in-game
date, so confusions like that didn't happen.
[MTTS] andawn: I am currently one hour in front of game time, normally I am
right on it.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Same, and that's sometimes one of my issues, things happen
very late at night for us, so I'm already tired when they start.
[MTTS] andawn: Same.
[MTTS] andawn: Not to mention I take sleeping pills. Once i've had them, I'm
out.
[MTTS] davetaylor: IFS at 1 AM is not fun.
[MTTS] andawn: This may not be something I should ask, and feel free to
completely ignore my question, but were there any plans to ever bring ginu back
into the picture? Or from an ic standpoint, are they just subjegated completely.

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

 She is wearing a sleeveless lilac cotton top with scalloped edges, a pair of
blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left
front pocket, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies
across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Starseekers get rid of the furnace charging systems that we used to put on the
salvage stations. While I like that method, we opted not to put them on for the
benefit of the newer pilots. However, we are going to put them on the BAS. So,
when you do beacons, please grab your ship debris and drop it there to help us
feed it. You won't get paid for this. But it's this or they go back on the
salvage stations, your choice."

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "See, that's the problem with
you poeple, you sit there, on your asses, and expect us, the nwer people, to do
all your work for you because you cannot be fucked. Amazing plan. How about we
just sit there and do nothing for once, and make you do all the work? Perhaps
then you'll realise the fact that you should actually help."

[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Sure it does. But what right
do you have to have less points than Keegan? Get to work, Owens."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "To be fair, nobody signed a
contract saying how much we have to work."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We're civilian pilots,
Nathaniel. Civilian. Our rights are somewhat restricted, but I still choose when
I want to work and whatnot. Short of our government mandating me a minimum
activity level, one which I probably already meet, I'm just fine."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What right do I have to have
less points? Lets just think about this for a couple of seconds. How long has
kegan been a pilot? How long have I been a pilot?"
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Shut it Owens. You'll lose this
one, pal."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "How about you talk to Morris
about that."

respect."

yourself. Did you get this kind of fuckin' treatment when you got back?"

haven't started screeming and shouting. I am mearly stating an opinon."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

already the finest hands down. I don't think you would despute that except that
they should be given Flares."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Could you be quiet, we are
having a serious conversation on channel one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But combined with
restricting information like that.. I'm just saying that if we're not careful,
we'll end up a military dictatorship as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you don't want to
hear the pilot liaison who is just doing his job and announcing goal status,
then tune out of channel 10."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I totally agree."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will say this and
take heat for it I bet. We are in this situlation because those who were pilots
before Best took office found that inaction was the best policy. That
isolationism was the best policy and you see how that worked out."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We obviously can not
run things ourselves and by ourselves or we would not be in the state that we
are currently in."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Unfortunately, I don't
see that we will be able to effect much influence. We have managed to survive
extinction so in consideration of this, I just don't think we'll be heard. Also
Vernos, Privatization wouldn't have worked any better. Privitazation generally
means poor execution and eventual ruin especially upon the type of functions we
perform. Privatazation may work for some aspects but not for a pilot corps which
should be there for our Government and Privatization would not have afforded
this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't necessarily agree
with that, but then I was flying in a time before all this other bad stuff
started happening."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What I am saying is
I do not agree with the policy that we can do things ourselves and back before
we dug the grave we are in. We should have been working with the other
governments instead of backing out of alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I misunderstood you
Vernos. That was my fault."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I am convinced that the
more conservative candidate had the same idea in mind as the Green Party
candidate and that is to eliminate the Pilot Corps via low-performing

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I agree, working

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Honestly, when we
broke off full alliance relations, we were doing more than fine for a while. The
only issues occurred when the older pilots like Kaito went away, and pilots like
me had less and less time to do things and to deticate ourselves to certain
matters. Then you went away too Eli, and the newer pilots all didn't really want
to do much. When it came to exploration, a lot of them said they would lead
expeditions, and only one really led one, and he left not too long ago too.
After that, other things started to decline. Pilots ran fewer beacon drops,
fewer ground activities etc and that was around the time that the decline
started. However, it definitely didn't start when alliance relations were
lowered to levels of non-aggression pacts. Heck, Kaito and I, regardless of the
lack of full alliance relations still practically helped lead the defense of
most sectors for the longest times. I'm just letting people presume because it's
kind of amusing to watch people who have only been pilots for meer months
interject their ever so informed opinions."

news."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They don't have much
choice Vernos."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not the fault of
the older pilots who went away. Eventually, pilot life becomes too much for lots
of people, and they might need to take breaks. However, those who were around
were supposed to pick up the slack when some of the older pilots had lesser and
lesser time to deticate to the work. That they didn't, and didn't inspire the
pilots who came later, is their fault, and most of those pilots who were around
at that time are not even around anymore either."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "They state that but
that would be in violation of the existing NAP."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not to mention that their
government owns all of their starships, just they like they own all of ours."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lily I doubt if the
government told them not to help that an NAP as you put it would exist."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Um."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If their government
tells them to break the NAP, then they break the NAP. That's just how it will
go. They don't have a choice, because as Eli said, the government owns a vast
majority of their assets anyway."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Vernos you listen to
their rhetoric far too much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And you tune out a
real possibilty so that you do not have to deal with it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That kinda stuff is
exactly why I think we need to make sure our voices are heard. If the current
adminstration decides something like that for us, we don't have much choice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I. Agree with eli."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Not really but I think
for myself and not what others want me to think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eli and Ather are
correct and trust me, the talk is there of not helping the AEU if they break
from the Accord already."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, that just goes
back to the meeting that Kim wants to have. Perhaps as a part of that meeting,
we can issue a joint statement from the AEU pilot corps, to the AEU government,
requesting that we maintain ties with the other alliances, continue to encourage
induction of our scientific people to the EAOS, if for no other reason then to
monitor those fuckers, and mos timportantly of all, maintain our ties to the
Accord."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I agree Ather so it
would bepretty serious business and they better be pretty certain that they want
to break a NAP for no justifiable reason."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bam. Debate ended.
Now all of you go back to your boxes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This isn't any other
alliances problem, not yet anyways. It's up to us. Thse are our homeworlds."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, That's definintely
something we need to do. We need to all stand together and let the government
know why these things are important."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, like I said. At
the enxt meeting, we could propose and write up a joint statement from the
entire AEU pilot corps, saying everything I just said in nicer more flowery
words. We cna have Lambeth attend the meeting so that he can get it first-hand,

if we stopped working for them? Until our voices were heard and taken into
account?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Are we all in

from everyone, but why would we allow such a thing? We may not be all buddy
buddy with everyone, but what if we went on some sort of strike?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, I don't suppose
you are aware of the fact that the government has control of those assets and
can take them anytime they want to from you. It's probably best not to go around
saying these things in public."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
W>F?k(B%xMK-68>cFp^nz"$]i3/<[39L8;Mr=rUm
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a
planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The
wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an
eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Transmitter;
Docking Bay.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered
Transmitter; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit

[Starship "Wandering Soul"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds

rift stop
You press a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins
dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."
ftl 776
The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 776."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Dear Shule,
I apologize for the lack of communication on my part. I haven't taken piloting
as seriously as I might, or communications. So today I resolved to do something
about that. *smiles* Thanks for saying I look cute. That was very sweet of you!
You seem fairly good looking and yyou have a great sense of yourself. Not afraid
to banter or be silly but serious when the situation warrents. Well, take care
of yourself. If you are still giving away felo i'm still interested. I just paid
my phone bill so i'm a phone call away. Have yourself a lovely day and safe
venturings throughout the galaxy!
Signed,
Tamra.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "No Mercy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Critical Strike"; Docking Bay.

[0m[Miriani] [Newbie] Lance Martellato: Read each room description, and go with
whatever you think your character will do best roleplaying in. It is possible to
switch alliances later down the road if you feel like you made the wrong choice,
but for the early stages of the game, it doesn't matter a whole lot.[0m
[0m[Miriani] [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: The best I can tell you is to explore the room
for each of your options. Short descriptions are given for each alliance that
you may choose. You can read also about the history for the alliances on the
website, if that's important to you, but as Lance says, you may switch later if
you feel you made the wrong choice. The most important part for now is to pick
the one that you feel you will roleplay best.[0m

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole

Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.
launch
You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's

-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

[Ventilation Tunnels; Dead End] (inside a battlesuit)
A large mound of mold has collected in this dead end of the ventilation system.
In general, if there could ever be any reason to want to visit a dead end, being
greeted with a pile of mold probably eliminates it.
You see Bari Worker Horde Alpha here.

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and
pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a lavender hoodie with a gold 'XX' embroidered on the front, a
lavender lace demi bra, a pair of skinny blue low rise jeans, and a pair of
lavender leather boots. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her face, both eyes,

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container,
and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

[Starship "Shadowwind"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is inside the riftflow.

[Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
