Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki
canvas sneakers, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies
across the toes, and a Tardick lizard named Raissa here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both
wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.
Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face
backwards.
Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other,
tortured bodies straining with the effort.
The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

Vernos Bailey says, "If this ship had pod recall I'd suggest a short pod ride
that gets recalled."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Wut."
Vernos Bailey says, "You know oh its your birthday so we will launch you in this
pod and then recall it as joke."

one half of joke already."

Aisling the Fox says, "You have been smelled."
Aisling says to Cheri, "Want your opinion."
Cheri says to Aisling, "About what."
Cheri Lindbergh sniffs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec. You
can only wonder what's so interesting.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Huh."
Aisling the Fox says, "Morris was rather angry yesterday at suggestion that regs
do not quite understand what it is like to live on ship that lacked securities
their ships have."
Cheri Lindbergh asks, "So what are you asking my opinion about?"
Aisling the Fox says, "I asked if he has ever known someone who died in a
starship as a point. He said he has killed people in starships and stormed off."
Cheri Lindbergh snorts.
Aisling the Fox says, "My question is whether this point of view is off base."

Cheri says to Aisling, "Anyway yeah, I think a lot of regs have no idea what
it's like."
Aisling the Fox nods.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Like the other cycle we were talking about those little
devices that make noise, music or whatever."
Aisling the Fox asks, "Which devices?"
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Like a little music box."
Aisling the Fox says, "Oh."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "We were imagining one that made different noises."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "And Anfisa said she would find the sound of ship noises
comforting, like as a sign that everything was okay."
Aisling the Fox nods.
Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.
Nissi Valdaire says, "White noise."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "To me, I'd just get homesick, but I think that's
something most regs would never consider."
Aisling the Fox says, "Yes."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah."
Cheri Lindbergh asks, "But no, you can't get mad just because someone else had a
different life of things you don't understand, like how the FUCK do people swim
in ponds? I don't get it. I can't swim in ponds, there could be brain-eating
amoebas in there. How could you not worry about it?"
Aisling the Fox says, "Like, I am okay sitting here and sleeping with everyone
in same room. It is not weird or uncomfortable. I lived in dormitory with
members of Sept. No sense of real privacy."
Morris Corlew looks at Cheri Lindbergh thoughtfully.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Ah, but I like my own room. Or just a roommate. I love
having a whole apartment to myself, it's so extreme."
Aisling the Fox says, "Oh, I do not mind my living quarters on Oracle and
sharing with Jason. It is nice. But I am accustomed to not having that."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "I got used to it real quick."
Aisling the Fox says, "I do not think I would like a whole apartment though. Too
much space."
Aisling the Fox says, "Not sure what to do with it."
Cheri says to Aisling, "You'd think of things to do with it."
Morris Corlew says, "Thing to consider is we all have different experiences too.
There are 'regs' who grew up with many brothers and sisters that are also used
to sleeping with little privacy."
Cheri says to Aisling, "Like this here is a room where I sit and read books,
this other room is where I watch videos. Like that."
Aisling the Fox says, "It is a little different when you are doing it as adult.
With other adults. And have no choice but to do it. That is point."
Cheri says to Aisling, "Hey and two bathrooms, I mean TWO BATHROOMS."
Aisling the Fox grins at Cheri Lindbergh.
Aisling the Fox asks, "Why do you need two bathrooms?"
Morris says to Aisling, "Not necessarily. Folks do it for other reasons as
adults."
Cheri says to Morris, "Well sure but the point was that there are things about
living on a ship that most people who came from planets never realize. Are you
going to argue about this?"
Morris says to Cheri, "No. I'm just sayin ya can't lump folks and their
experiences into categories and judge them based on that."
Morris Corlew says, "No group is all something or all something else."
Aisling the Fox says, "Not judging. Just saying that it is an experience they do
not understand. Not saying they are better or worse for it."
Morris Corlew says, "I'm also capable of understandin things you may not think
I'm capable of understandin."
Cheri says to Morris, "Well woop."
Morris says to Cheri, "Really? So if I started talkin 'Uregs this' and 'Unregs
that,' would it bother ya?"
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Anyway yeah, there are definitely things weird about
planets too, like... if you just went to the day side of a planet, you get this
disconnected feeling like you are really nowhere, but at night, it all falls
back into place."
Cheri says to Morris, "Nah, it probably wouldn't unless you were lying."
Morris says to Cheri, "Overgeneralizations don't bother you at all?"
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
Cheri says to Morris, "Well, considering that this conversation started about
people who live on ships and people who don't, it looks like it's you throwing
out the overgeneralizations, not me. You're talking about judging groups of
people, I'm talking about bathrooms."
Aisling the Fox says, "I do not think it over generalization to say regs don't
know what it is like to live on ship without such safeties reg ships have.
Because they do not."
Aisling the Fox says, "That is just a fact statement. Again not saying they or I
am better or worse for it. Just that it is what it is. M."
Morris says to Aisling, "No, but sayin we're incapable of thinkin about the
danger involved is another thing. Just 'cause I've never lived on one don't mean
I can't understand that my own can fail and have thought about it."
Aisling the Fox says, "Thinking about things and experiencing it first hand are
different though."
Morris says to Aisling, "You have experienced your ship blowing up and it killin
ya?"
Aisling eyes widen.
Morris Corlew asks, "Well?"
Cheri Lindbergh grins.
Aisling the Fox asks, "You are really asking me this? You know why I am here?"
Aisling the Fox says, "My ship had catastrophic explosion."
Aisling the Fox says, "I could be dead. My people could be dead."
Aisling the Fox exclaims, "All of them!"
Aisling the Fox exclaims, "You ask me this?!"
Aisling the Fox exclaims, "How dare you!"
Morris says to Aisling, "You are here because it hasn't happened to you.
Therefore while you may have lived under a higher fear of it happenin, it didn't
happen to you...just as it hasn't happened to me."
Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.
Aisling the Fox prances south.
Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet
hiss of hydraulics.
Morris Corlew shakes his head as if to himself.
Cheri says to Morris, "Now you've done it."
Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.
Morris says to Cheri, "Confronted her thinkin on somethin?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "You know... most spacers that I know have lost friends or
family to ship failures, pirate attacks, stuff like that."
Nissi says to Morris, "I don't think you and I can say the same."
Nissi Valdaire says, "So have a little sensitivity."
Morris says to Nissi, "No, but we've seen it happen. Most of us have. I'm not
tryin to be insensitive. I just..."
Morris lowers his eyes.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Not to people we know."
Morris Corlew says, "I don't have to know somebody to feel somethin."
Vernos Bailey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which
accepts it and stores it in a compartment.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "That wasn't the point anyway."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Having lived in ships for a few weeks at a time here and
there, here's what I don't understand about spacers."
Nissi Valdaire says, "How they do this their whole lives without murdering each
other after too many conversations like these."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Vernos Bailey grins.
Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.
Damien Goss says, "Probably don't have conversations like these."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "No shit, you should have seen it when all us girls got
our periods at the same time."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "My poor dad."
Damien Goss asks, "How many sisters?"
Damien Goss asks, "Or girls?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe not. I guess you learn what topics to avoid. We're
too used to always having more space to run to."
Morris Corlew says, "Seems all of us are."
Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.
Morris Corlew says, "Not just regs."
Nissi Valdaire says, "About a week into these trips, we always get tempers
flaring."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Always worse after turnaround."
Damien Goss says, "I only got upset yesterday because I don't like people
telling me what I think and how I think."
Vernos Bailey says, "We have not even turned around yet."
Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.
Melinda Michaels says, "I didn't do it."
Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.
Morris says to Melinda, "I did."
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
Damien Goss says, "I didn't want to argue, so I went to bed."
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I know. Just sayin I bet more of this will happen. But it
shouldn't be too bad, we're all friends for the most part."
Damien Goss nods.
Melinda says to Morris, "You and Damien into it again?"
Damien Goss says, "Not me, I didn't do anything."
Morris Corlew chuckles and shakes his head at Melinda Michaels. "Nah."
Melinda says to Damien, "Oh."
Damien Goss says, "I've just been watching the rift controls."
Damien Goss says, "Waiting for a quasar."
Morris says to Melinda, "Just the whole reg versus unreg there's now way I can
understand this or that is gettin old."
Vernos says to Nissi, "Would have expected us AEU pilots to be causing the rucus
eh?"
Melinda Michaels nods to Morris Corlew.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Not really."
Morris rubs his temples.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Anything can flare up."

Aisling the Fox looks at Damien Goss thoughtfully.
Aisling the Fox asks, "Why is that?"
Melinda Michaels says, "I have not had this happen to me either. However, I
understand that it has to be terrible feelings and scary because of the tragic
implications."
Melinda Michaels says, "So that is understanding."
Aisling says to Melinda, "Perhaps understand is not quite the right word."
Eli Grey says, "Kinda sounds like the problem here, is the word "Understand"
sounds like there's a bit of a difference in what they are meaning."
Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.
Damien Goss says, "I was stillrecovering from serious emotional trauma and I

Melinda Michaels says, "And I'll be honest."
Melinda Michaels says, "I don't like people telling me how I feel or that I am
stupid reg either."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Come on though, Morris has had a case against us for a
while now. Cycles and cycles, and it was even before the Kelsey thing. Maybe it
started with Akemi, I don't know. Maybe before that."
Melinda Michaels says, "That's hurtful too."
Melinda Michaels says, "So everybody says and does things because of whatever is
causing this tension thing. Like Cheri said, there has been something for awhile
now."
Aisling says to Melinda, "Repeatedly said it has nothing to do with anything
like that. What I experience does not make me better or you worse. Just
experiences cannot all be... empathized with unless you too have experienced
it."
Aisling the Fox says, "Not saying Morris or anyone is stupid."
Eli says to Aisling, "Yeah, I sorta get that."
Aisling the Fox says, "I get he is trying to say he understands. But at same
time he does not fully. And then has to argue over it."
Melinda says to Aisling, "You see, it's not the same situation but, I have
experienced loss of loved ones, we all have. So people take offense when they
get told nobody understands. People understand loss, maybe waiting for something
bad to happen while a loved one is fighting for life. Everybody knows somebody
that has had that and gets it."
Melinda Michaels says, "That's the roadblock."
Eli Grey says, "It doesn't compare to what unregs have to deal with, but it's
kinda like how everyone is always saying my skin is cool, and they may even have
some empathy about it, but they haven't experienced walking through their home
town and folks looking at you like you're a freak or like they are scared."
Damien Goss nods.
Damien Goss says, "That's actually a pretty good comparison."
Aisling the Fox nods to Eli Grey.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, the point is, we all have shit."
Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.
Eli says to Melinda, "And what you said was said very well, just saying."
Melinda Michaels says, "Like sure, I may be stupid reg but do you think I want
to be called it? No, same as you wouldn't ant to be called stupid unreg. It's
hurtful."
Melinda Michaels says, "Anyway, I am done."
Melinda Michaels says, "Sorry."
Aisling says to Melinda, "Have I called you stupid reg though?"
Melinda says to Aisling, "I am not pointing at you literally."
Melinda says to Aisling, "These are just htings that happen."
Aisling the Fox says, "Frankly I feel more stupid that I think most regs are."
Melinda says to Aisling, "Well you are not."
Aisling the Fox says, "Than I think."
Aisling the Fox says, "There are many things I do not know and do not
understand."
Melinda Michaels says, "We are all that way if we admit it."
Damien Goss says, "That's par for the course, if you are human."
Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.
Eli Grey says, "Everyone is ignorant, just depends on about what."
Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know or understand what Anfisa's life was like.
She is not reg. But we are vastly different."
Melinda Michaels says, "We can't truly know something that we have not
experienced. We can only show some understanding to various aspects of a

Aisling the Fox points vaguely off into space.

Melinda Michaels says, "Morris is saying he understands, I'll say it too. I

they will be gone because I know this pain of losing people."
Melinda Michaels says, "So everybody is correct."
Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Damien says to Aisling, "Let me ask you a question about something you said

in this conversation. He engaged me."
Cheri says to Aisling, "I feel like he's doing that too."
Aisling says to Damien, "Sure."
Melinda Michaels says, "Then find out why he is picking fights, there has got to

Damien Goss nods. "Ok, I am not saying one way or the other but that may have
been a point of miscommunication."
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah I understand what he means by the understanding
thing."
Morris Corlew begins leaning against a bulkhead.
Aisling says to Damien, "It would not be first time I have had communication
error. I am not best ad doing this."
Melinda says to Morris Corlew, "Right then, tell her what you mean by you
understand her situation."
"Me too!" Damien Goss nods.
Morris Corlew lowers his head.
Damien Goss says, "I suck at expressing my self sometimes, that's why I try to
just shut up and listen, heh."
The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.
Morris says to Aisling, "Do you understand the difference between experiencing a
situation and having empathy?"
Morris quickly rubs at his eyes, turning away briefly.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
Aisling the Fox says, "Sympathy is when you are feeling bad for a person.
Empathy is when you have had experience that person has had and can speak to
it."
Damien Goss exclaims, "Wait!"
Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Empathy doesn't require having had the exact
same experience."
Eli Grey says, "I.. don't think that's quite what empathy means."
Damien Goss says, "Empathy is when you can feel something someone else is
feeling."
Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.
Damien Goss says, "So fear, roger, worry, roger, and so on."
Eli Grey says, "It works though, for the purposes of this discussion I think,
lacking a better word."
Ather Jammoa asks, "Are we really discussing the differences between empathy and
sympathy?"
Morris Corlew says, "It doesn't require that I have lost loved ones on a ship.
It just requires that I 'get it.'"
Damien Goss says, "Well, there's sympathy, empathy, and understanding."
Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and
peers at the screen.
Damien Goss says, "Understanding is specific, empathy is general, sympathy is
just expression."
Aisling the Fox says, "I just do know know if you do without having actually
experienced it."
Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.
Nissi Valdaire says, "There's a difference between understanding that a thing
happens and actually having past trauam about it."
Damien Goss nods.
Morris Corlew says, "No, I have not been on a ship in literal fear of my life. I
know that our ship safety systems are damn good. But anything can fail."
Melinda says to Aisling, "Okay, that little girl."
Ather says to Nissi, "It's OK if I feel no sympathy, right?"
Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire. "This is my point."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Or trauma even."
Damien Goss looks at Ather Jammoa and shrugs. "Some people don't."
Nissi Valdaire says, "That's why they vote Best."
Morris Corlew says, "I have felt other loss. I have felt in danger of my life.
Heck, I've put myself in those situations."
Melinda says to Aisling, "I was stupid reg and helped you because I understood
your worry and grief. I got that you needed to know for sure to have peace of
mind. So I tried to help, do you see?"
Ather Jammoa glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device.
Aisling the Fox says, "You were not stupid."
Melinda says to Aisling, "Do you see what I mean though?"
Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device.
Aisling the Fox says, "But yes. I know that."
Melinda says to Aisling, "That's what he is saying."
Melinda Michaels says, "Same thing."
Aisling the Fox says, "But there is still a difference I think."
Aisling the Fox says, "And that is what I am saying."
Aisling the Fox says, "I just do not know words for it."
Morris Corlew says, "Differences are what drive us. None of us has the exact
same experience."
Morris Corlew says, "But we can have empathy for each other. We can 'get it.'
Being lumped into 'Reg this' and 'Reg that' hurts, Aisling."
Damien Goss says, "So, I have a suggestion. I read this in a book somewhere a
long time ago."
Cheri says to Morris, "Well I do that plenty."
Morris says to Cheri, "I know."
Cheri Lindbergh asks, "So?"
Morris Corlew asks, "So it's ok for y'all to say hurtful things to and about us,
but not if we do it? Even by accident?"
Morris takes a deep breath and rests is head against the bulkhead closing his
eyes for a moment.
Aisling the Fox says, "And I am believing you cannot fully appreciate the
feeling someone has unless you have had it yourself. You can understand if that
is how you want to say it sure. But there is difference from understanding and
sharing experience."
Ather Jammoa asks, "Bah, people say shit about the AEU all the time too. Who
cares what people label you long as you know what you are?"
Aisling the Fox says, "I appreciate you understand. I am not saying I do not."
Cheri says to Morris, "What are you even talking about?"
[0m#SESSION 'StarConquest' ACTIVATED.[0m
Morris says to Aisling, "You act like you don't."
Cheri says to Morris, "You keep jumping out to questions that assume we know
what you're talking about."
Nissi Valdaire says, "The universe isn't a level playing field. Our people were
basically hunting their people for sport not too long ago. We still have a lot
more than they do."
Aisling the Fox says, "I act like I don't like it when you seemed to insist you
knew exactly what I was going through."
Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner and nods to Nissi
Valdaire.
Eli says to Morris, "Maybe next time, just say 'I feel for you'?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "So yes being anti-reg is not as bad as being anti-spacer."
Morris says to Eli, "I've tried that."
Eli Grey says, "That sounds like that's all he was trying to get at before."
Eli Grey shrugs.
Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.
Melinda Michaels shrugs. "We all have feelings, nobody likes to be put in a box
or labeled as being different or less than others."
Damien Goss nods.
Ather says to Morris, "Back in the day, bounties were placed on all unreg ships.
If we ever saw a salvage junker or whatever salvaging within the FTL beacon
network, we'd do our best to shoot it down, then we'd shoot down any ships that
they called to aid it."
Morris Corlew says, "I have no control over what folks did before I was even
around here...before I was even born. None whatsoever. But...somehow it's ok for
me to be lumped into the folks that did these horrendous things, but it's not ok
for 'unregs' to be lumped together when as a group the bad things have been done
too."
Morris nods emphatically in Melinda's direction.
Cheri says to Nissi, "I gotta say, I'm not really anti-reg and any reg who's my
friend knows this. I don't even talk about it much, but it seems like when I do
say something, anything, about regs, it sure gets noticed. Maybe that's because
I yell a lot."
Ather says to Cheri, "Poacher stomp?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "That's how it is with everything. Like having an org just
for women isn't sexist because of the whole history and context of it all."
Morris says to Ather, "I know this. I do. And it fucking sucks. 'Scuse my
language. But it does. However, I couldn't do a damn thing to change it. So why
am I lumped in this group?"
Cheri Lindbergh grins at Ather Jammoa.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Sexism and racism and all that, they're words that
describe punching down. Not anything else."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Same way with spacers I'd say."
Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.
There is a sudden squeak from somewhere inside the starship, cut off with a
crunch and the sound of scuttling legs.
Morris says to Nissi, "So...saying unflattering things about regs isn't the
same?"
Ather says to Morris, "Well, you have to understand the mindset back in the day.
If you were around then you would've probably done nothing to change it.
Imagine...hmm, let's put this into perspective."
Morris says to Ather, "How do you know that?"
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Oh yeah, I don't hesitate to say shit about unregs
either. Anybody can tell you that."
Ather says to Morris, "Imagine 10 years from now, Kelsey's allied faction was
also made into an alliance. Offered pardons, whatever."
Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.
Ather Jammoa says, "Kinda like that."
Morris says to Ather, "Blowin up his ships doesn't end lives. Just takes from
his coffers a bit."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't like being lumped in any more than anybody, but I
understand the reasons for it and it's hard to get too offended when you know
the history."
Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly. "I've never gotten offended at being called a
reg."
Morris Corlew shakes his head. "It just...it bothers me to basically be lumped
in with folks who did somethin I cannot see myself doin, period."
Ather Jammoa says, "I -am- a reg."
Melinda says to Cheri, "Yes, you will go at whomever you need to. It doesn't
matter, that's the right way."
Morris says to Ather, "It's the attitude with it, not just the word."
Cheri Lindbergh grins at Melinda Michaels. "I've been trying to calm down."
Ather says to Morris, "Still doesn't bother me."
Ather Jammoa says, "The stereotype is there no matter what."
Morris says to Ather, "So just 'cause somethin don't bother you it shouldn't
bother nobody else?"
Morris says to Ather, "Yes, and the stereotype is wrong, and often plum
hurtful."
Ather Jammoa says, "You were a planetborn member of the League of Old Earth
Democracies. You are a reg. That label is not incorrect. It is what it is. If
you read more into it, well, that's all you, pal."
Melinda says to Nissi, "That's the thing though, some people can take more hits
and shake it off. Others, it cuts."
Morris says to Ather, "It's more than the label. It's the attitude and biases
that are attached to it."
Eli Grey says, "I mean.. it's really just short for "registered individual""
Morris nods sadly to Melinda.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure, but to us it's just an annoying word. To them, until
a few years ago, that unreg label meant they basically weren't human. Could just
murder em and no consequences."
Ather Jammoa says, "Cheri, Pierre and Aisling use to call me a reg all the time!
Heck, the first time I ever met Aisling, she called me an Outsider. Not knowning
what she was referring to with the word, I actually think I was more ofefnded at
first at being called an Outsider than I ever was at being called a reg."
Ather Jammoa chortles.
Cheri Lindbergh grins at Aisling the Fox. "That's pretty funny."
Morris Corlew says, "You can call me a Reg all day long. I know what it
technically means. But when you start implyin or statin outright I can't feel
somethin, can't understand somethin 'cause I lived most of my life on a planet,
that's where I have an issue."
Damien Goss smiles.
Damien says to Aisling, "That is pretty amusing, I wish I had heard that."
Aisling the Fox says, "Eachtrannach means outsider. Not Outsider."
Morris Corlew says, "When it comes down to it, we're all human."
Ather Jammoa grins at Aisling the Fox.
Aisling the Fox says, "As in, you are an outsider to my group."
Ather says to Damien, "See?"
Morris Corlew says, "There are good 'regs' and bad 'regs.' Good 'unregs' and bad
'unregs.'"
Ather says to Damien, "But when she elaborated, I shrugged it off again like
'Unreg'"
Damien Goss nods.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, think about Aisling's people. We're all outsiders
to them. So what, it's just how they think of things, it doesn't mean anything
about who you are inside. This is just dumb."
Morris Corlew says, "Lump folks all in together and try and fit 'em into a neat
little box, it just don't work."
Ather Jammoa says, "I was pretty much just like eh, fuck it. Call me whatever
floats your boat. You don't know what I think about you in my head."
Ather Jammoa smirks.
Damien Goss says, "Like I said earlier I don't have a problem being called a
reg. I just have a problem telling me how and what I think."
"It's not the word." Morris Corlew shakes his head. "That's what I'm tryin to
say. It's the attitude and accusations that go with it."
Morris says to Damien, "Thank you."
Ather says to Aisling, "I use to make fun of you behind your back do you care."
Aisling the Fox asks, "Used to?"
Aisling the Fox says, "I assume you still do."
Eli says to Morris, "We also hae to know who we are ourselves though bud. When
that girl said all AEU pilts should be fired, I honestly didn't think she was
talking about me personally."
Ather Jammoa says, "Well, it's more fun to do it outright, I admit."
Ather Jammoa says, "So now I don't even bother to make fun of you behind your
back."
Eli says to Morris, "Don't get me wrong, I can understand that it's
frustrating."
Morris says to Aisling, "And that don't bother you, but it bothers you that I
think I can feel things you don't think I'm capable of?"
Cheri says to Eli, "It's like, people say shit, so what?"

Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

upset."
Eli Grey smiles at Melinda Michaels.
Eli Grey nods.
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Melinda Michaels and nods and nods and nods.
Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Ather hmms.
Ather Jammoa looks at you and shrugs.
Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.
Ather Jammoa looks at Eli Grey and shrugs.
Ather Jammoa nods.
Cheri says to Melinda, "Well, I'm fine with that but not to the point where I
shut up for fear of offending somebody."
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I'm going to go check things!"
Ather Jammoa stands up from a white leather sofa.
Ather Jammoa strides south.
Nissi Valdaire says, "And Ather was never seen again."
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Aisling the Fox asks, "So question remains. Does Morris like to argue with me
for some reason?"
Eli Grey says, "I wasn't here when this all started, but it definintely sounds
like the two of you got caught up on the word "understand""
Morris says to Aisling, "I actually hate when I argue with you. I think way more
than you realize."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "I feel like he does. And he likes to dig on me too, like
with that stupid fucking letter of dots. How stupid."
Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.
Aisling the Fox asks, "Then why argue with me?"
Melinda says to Cheri, "Yeah I don't think anybody is asking you to shut up. The
difference is, when you speak, you fully understand you may get something back
and are prepared to handle it. Others, get hurt and upset."
Morris says to Cheri, "It was a joke."
Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.
Cheri says to Melinda, "Oh, I am!"
Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.
Aisling the Fox says, "Was hurtful joke. How rude."
Ather Jammoa says to Nissi, "By the way, if we do run out of probes on this
thing, I do have 55 more on invocation that we could use."
Morris Corlew asks, "Wait, sending a little drawing on a letter...a line...is a
hurtful joke?"
Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, it's not likely that we will, but well."
Ather Jammoa says, "Just I don't have any impact ones."
Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Eli says to Ather, "What happened to your head?"
Eli Grey says, "You got a big bruise."
Aisling says to Morris, "Are you going to say what is hurtful to Cheri?"
Ather says to Nissi, "But I'm pretty sure if we used probes on invocation
everyone on the science vessel will get credited."
Morris Corlew sighs to himself and shakes his head as if to himself.
Cheri says to Morris, "You know what I was thinking you were sending, that
letter you were sending to everybody else except me. You took the time to send
it, I went to Tandem thinking it was something worthy, and it was some fucking
dots."

A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to
possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki
canvas sneakers, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery
fireflies across the toes here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with white trim around the collar and
cuffs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both
wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.
Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "I'm almost certain these don't have planets, but think
Nissi'd be bothered if I took the time to survey anyhow?"
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
updraft.

white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the

Five stars orbit each other here in a complicated ballet, both dwarf stars and
main sequence stars. Readings indicate this formation is probably unstable;
within a few million years, one or more of the stars may end up ejected from the

forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
