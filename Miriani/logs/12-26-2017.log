You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy, and a hologram of a flower garden projected in the middle of the room here.

01:31 Bright birds and pale butterflies flit over a neatly kept garden of vibrantly colored flowers. Puffy white clouds drift lazily through a blue sky, and the leaves on the rose bushes in the garden sway gently in the breeze. Tall orange blooms nod gently, their tops bobbing over beds of red and purple flowers.
The switch appears to be in the on position.

01:31 A red heart-shaped air freshener freshens the room with the scent of roses.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.

13:34 [Newbie] Cara West: What you do with your credits is up to you. You can put it in insurance if you lose a ship, put it in a fund, or keep it all on hand. That's your choice.

13:34 [Newbie] Michael Johnson: I don't think we can bank money either, unless you talk about insurance funds?

13:34 [Newbie] Michael Johnson: Or funds, too.

13:34 [Chatter] Jack West transmits, "Isn't it interesting, I have here the droid, so, here is either here or here could be there, but where ever here the droid is, it will remain here!"

13:34 [Chatter] Erik Yobi cheers.

13:34 #$#soundpack social | cheer | male

13:34 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Is the starting 2 million dollar ship worth insuring?

13:34 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Nope.

13:35 #$#soundpack_pong

13:35 #$#soundpack_lag 114

13:35 [Newbie] Moiraine Yobi: Well, if you had the goal of saving for an expensive project, you'd like to save a certain amount or whatever so you don't accidentally spend money, which is an in character choice but bottom line is that banking money is more about having it set aside for the situation where you need it, whatever that situation might be.

13:35 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: What is a good route? Asteroid Mining or combat missions?

13:35 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Only ensure larger ships from maybe 10000000 upwards. I'd argue that even that isn't worth it yet.

13:35 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Also it's not dollar, but credit.

13:35 [Newbie] Jack West: But you should get a cargo hauler also, if you don't have one already, also, I would refer you to help getting started, which will maybe help a bit.

13:35 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: I meant asteroid hauling. I think I'll save up for a bigger ship.

13:35 [Newbie] Cara West: To get better ships and to upgrade said ships you need a mix of licence and combat points.

13:35 [Newbie] Cara West: Only way to get combat is by combat missions.

13:36 #$#soundpack_pong

13:36 #$#soundpack_lag 114

13:36 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Is there a preferable newbie ship to build up for combat missions? Like as a starter without combat points.

13:36 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Combat missions are always good, but as a start, go with other people on their combat missions. Other than that, haul debris until you have enough for a roid hauler.

13:36 [Newbie] Jack West: The fighter is a good ship to start up with combat missions, but you need to get a few points to buy it first.

13:36 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Its worth practicing combat in a starship simulator.

13:37 #$#soundpack_pong

13:37 #$#soundpack_lag 117

13:37 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Can the simulator give me points ro will it just show me the ropes?

13:37 [Newbie] Jack West: Neither, it simply simulates a sector where you can make a simulated ship to fight simulated drones.

13:37 [Newbie] Cara West: It'll help you practice how to fly and shoot and eng with no risk to real ships.

13:38 #$#soundpack_pong

13:38 #$#soundpack_lag 118

13:38 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: It doesn't give points. It will literally simulate a battle enviromnent. But first maybe join other people's missions to practice gunning.

13:38 [Newbie] Anny Rain: You need practice,if you don't do it,you will blow up.

13:38 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Will someone take on a newibe gunner?

13:38 [Newbie] Moiraine Yobi: Sure they will.

13:38 [Newbie] Cara West: Of course.

13:38 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: It's someone occupying a much needed space.

13:39 #$#soundpack_pong

13:39 #$#soundpack_lag 115

13:39 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: There are lots of people who are kind to newbies.

13:39 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: I met two awesome players already.

13:39 [Newbie] Moiraine Yobi: But you don't get practice if you don't go. So in character, when missions are called for or spots for missions, then you might just say you'd like to go.

13:40 #$#soundpack_pong

13:40 #$#soundpack_lag 116

13:40 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Which channel do players usually ask for gunners/miussion help?

13:40 [Newbie] Anny Rain: You should read help file.

13:40 [Newbie] Cara West: On the general comm channel.

13:41 #$#soundpack_pong

13:41 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Do I turn into general with m ycommunicator?

13:42 #$#soundpack_pong

13:42 #$#soundpack_lag 113

13:42 [Newbie] Moiraine Yobi: I believe by default, the channel is turned on. So you just leave your communicator on and wait. You can do other activities while you wait though.

13:44 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Chatter is for normal chatting to each other. General is for missions etc. You can reply to someone calling for missions over general.

20:00 ["Pandia" Weapons Room 3] (indoors) (sitting on a plush royal blue velvet crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. You see a glowing picture frame containing a canvas titled "Coded Message" hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.
You can go west.

The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

21:39 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:39 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:39 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

21:39 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:39 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:39 The ship needs to be in space to move.

21:39 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

21:39 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:39 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Acrylon.

21:39 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:39 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

21:39 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:40 #$#soundpack_pong

21:40 #$#soundpack_lag 111

21:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

21:40 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:40 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

21:40 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

21:40 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

Houses
--------------------------------------------------
HOUSES:
Q: What do I need to get a house?
A: Houses are 5000 points and two billion credits up front plus an additional fee (10 million) for each room you add.
Q: Where can a house be located?
A: A house can be located on any planet, moon, or spacestation other than: Acrylon, Angelus, Outreach, Miriani, Pax, Empanda, Aquili, Freistadt, Charon, Venus, Mercury, Pluto, Luna, Earth, Caranza, any of the stations in sector 19, any planet or moon in sector 12, the Jump Hub Station in sector 0, and any player-owned space station or planet unless you have the permission of the station or planet owner. These are subject to change and other places may be added at any time.
Q: What can a house have?!
A: A house will come with a way to boot anyone out of the house, a biometric entrance where you can set the people you want able to come in, an optional pool, an optional hot tub, an optional private garage, and the ability to create the design of the house exactly as you'd like it and describe all the rooms yourself.
Q: How do I get a house?
A: Visit the realtor's office on Aquatimis in sector 10. From the office itself, type REQUEST. Your name will be placed in a queue and somebody will meet with you when time permits to create your house. When requesting your realtor, make sure you have information ready, such as what planet you would like your house on, where on the pla
21:50 net you want it, and what you would like it called.
Q: I don't want my house to be at this location anymore. How can I get it moved?
A: For a fee of 1,000,000,000 credits, you can assist and have your house relocated. This fee is non-negociable. Think of it as having to break up your house into segments and send it by truck across country. Moving houses is a very tedious process, so in order to curb the constant requests to relocate, we had to impose a fee.
*** It is worth noting that if your house is built on a private structure, such as a space station, moon or planet that does not belong to you and the owner of the property denies you access, it is entirely an in character issue. Furthermore, if the property's owner is no longer in the game and another party purchases the property, it is not the responsibility or obligation of the hosts to move your house for you free of charge.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central 
22:02 video screen, Mekensie the droid, and a roll of red wrapping paper patterned with stars here.
You can go south and out.

Stunning
--------------------------------------------------
Combat in Miriani is limited to stunning only. There is no death. The following is an introduction to stun combat. The guide assumes that you have a stun gun and stun ammunition.
Note about pulse emitters: Generally speaking, all of this information applies to pulse emitters. The only noteworthy thing is that pulse emitters are for disabling technology, not people. They are to be used on droids, drones, internal stun turrets, etc.
  Types of Ammunition
There are several types of ammunition, each of which can either come in a 50-pack or an individual magazine. The types of ammunition are: small (6 shots), regular (12 shots), high capacity (24 shots), and photoballistic (12 shots). Small, regular, and high capacity magazines differ only in the number of shots available per cartridge. Photoballistic magazines, however, inflict more stun time, but they carry less shots.
Bulk Ammunition - 50-packs of ammunition are often the best way to purchase ammunition. Unlike single magazines, bulk ammunition cannot be directly loaded into a weapon. You will first be required to purchase an ammunition storage container. Once you have a container, type PUT 50 IN CONTAINER to load the ammunition into the container. When you want to remove a single magazine from the container, type UNLOAD CONTAINER. Note: What you have to type depends on a number of factors, including the actual 
22:24 name of your ammunition storage container. If your ammo container is called bob, you would type UNLOAD BOB.
  Loading Your Weapon
In order to load your stun gun, you must be holding both a stun gun and a single ammunition magazine. Please be aware that attempting to load a 50-pack will not work, as that is a package of 50 magazines instead of a single one. Please see above for more information.
To actually load the weapon, type: LOAD MAGAZINE.
  Shooting Somebody
To shoot somebody, you merely type: SHOOT [PERSON]
This assumes you are holding a loaded stun gun. You may also find that certain other things may be shootable, such as aliens.
  Unloading Your Weapon
To unload your weapon, simply type: UNLOAD [weapon name]
This will cause the magazine to come out of the gun and into your waiting hand.
  Holsters
Holsters allow a quick and convenient place to store your weapon. Once worn, you can holster your weapon by typing HOLSTER and draw it by typing DRAW. Only one thing can be stored in a holster at a time. If you're wearing multiple holsters, you can specify which to draw by typing DRAW [NUMBER]. So if you're wearing two holsters and want to draw from the second, type DRAW 2.
  Defense
There isn't much you can do to defend against a stun attack. The best option is to take cover behind an object while taking an elusive stance (explained below). To accomplish taking cover, you type: COVER [OBJECT]. If you're successful, you should be told that you're taking cover behind an object. To step away from the object, type COVER again. If you wish to protect somebody else, you can type PROTECT [PERSON].
If somebody is taking cover behind you, you can step aside to reveal them by typing UNCOVER.
  Stance
There are four different stances available to you: Elusive, normal, aggressive, and precise. You can change your stance by typing STANCE [stance]. You can see your current stance by just typing STANCE. The following stances are available:
Elusive - Increased chance of dodging a stun attack. Decreased chance of hitting.
Normal - No bonus either way.
Aggressive - Increased chance of hitting a target. Decreased chance of dodging.
Precise - Increased chance of hitting target and doing more damage at the decrease of dodging ability and added roundtime when firing.
It's worth noting that changing your stance won't produce immediate results. While you will get a small bonus, the real bonuses accumulate as you play the game in the stance you chose. When you're unidle on the game, your character will be subconsciously aware of his or her stance. The longer they think about it, the better they will do. As you idle, you will gradually lose the bonus until it's back to the minimal level. This also occurs when you sleep. Please keep in mind that scripts to keep you unidle will now fall under cheating, as it will allow you to keep bonuses that other
22:24 s are not able to keep.

Stranding
---------
Summary
-------
Stranding is the act of leaving a player in a location in which they have no immediate means of escape. This is legal under specific circumstances outlined in this policy.
Details
-------
What is stranding?
To strand a player means that you're leaving them in a location in which escape would be difficult or impossible without outside intervention. This is a natural part of the game and, when used appropriately, can be an effective means of deterring another player from taking hostile action against you. However, stranding is not meant to be permanent imprisonment meant to remove a player from the game. It's intended to be used as a temporary means of detainment. There is a difference!
Limitations of Stranding:
To help ensure that stranding is a temporary punishment, there is a limit to how long you can keep somebody stunned and actively work to keep them stranded. This limit is six hours. This means that after six hours, you can no longer continue stunning the person, nor can you actively interfere with attempts to rescue them from being stranded. Basically, after six hours, you're required to give up the chase and let the person continue playing the game. Attempts to actively interfere include, but are not limited to: Asking other players to take over where you left off, destroying ships that attempt to land to rescue the player, stunning the player, putting the player in a situation where the game stuns them but you technically are not, putting the player at any risk that they themselves have not instigated. A two hour window cooldown is in place once the stranding limit has been reached. During these two hours, you may not actively attempt to strand or interfere with the player you previously stranded unless directly provoked.
On the other hand, the person being stunned should not and cannot use this policy as a shield to act with impunity after the six hours is up. This means that you cannot harass the other player without fear of consequence just because their six hour stranding window has closed. If you're found to be instigating a new conflict, the player is well within their rights to take appropriate actions given the in character circumstances.
Legal Stranding Venues
You can legally strand a player any place that another player can reasonably rescue them OR any place that the player can freely rescue themself without undue time and effort. This includes any planet inside communications range or inside a starship that can be ESCAPED from or SELF-DESTRUCTED.
Illegal Stranding Venues
The list of illegal venues is slightly longer, as these are situations that have been found to be difficult for players to rejoin the game from. Illegal venues include, but are not limited to:
    * Asteroids where the stranded player doesn't have access to a ship. The ship should be located near the player
22:25  and unlocked, or the player should have a key. It is illegal to force the player to hunt for the ship and / or the key.
    * Asteroids that have been completely blocked from launching or landing. This applies to any space object surrounding the asteroid and preventing escape, not just blockades.
    * Any planet, space station, asteroid, moon, relic, platform, or landable location in general outside of the numbered sectors. This includes remote outposts.
    * Behind a locked door, including starship blast doors.
    * Private structures. Since private structures provide access controls not normally applicable, they are prohibited from becoming stranding destinations. Private structures include any player-owned apartment, house, space station, moon, planet, asteroid, or platform.
Interrogation
It is legal to temporarily strand a player behind a locked blast door or in an otherwise illegal location if your intention is to temporarily interrogate them. The conditions of this arrangement are that you MUST ACTIVELY be engaging with the person in roleplay by talking to them. Note that the six hour limit still applies, so you must return them to a legal location after the time limit expires.
Enforcement
-----------
If found in violation of this policy, you will be required to unstrand your captive, making certain they are unstunned and on a planet where they can find transport elsewhere. If this is not possible, a host will move your victim to their alliance's capital planet. In addition, these penalties will be enacted depending on how many times you've violated this policy:
1: You will receive a warning from the host dealing with the situation.
2: You will lose 100 license points.
3: You will lose 20% of your total license points.
4: You will be locked out of the game for two weeks.
5: You will be locked out of the game for two months.
Any further violations will result in a permanent ban.
