01:42:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wal
01:42:03 l-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

01:42:10 You peer out...

01:42:10 
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

01:52:35 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "So he doesn't have to be lonely."

01:53:44 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "They do have... dark. I think that is what you wanted?"

01:53:52 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

01:54:01 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yes, please."

01:54:05 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright."

01:55:40 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I... don't know how I'm gonna eat this huge burger, but I will try."

02:00:56 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:00:56 0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:00:56 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:00:59 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.

02:01:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We achieved our first tier performance goal! Good job! Let's go for all of them next time!"

02:01:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up 2.3% from the last Conquest period. Good job!"

02:01:09 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hope we will still fit in a gemini."

02:01:17 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire snickers. "We will."

02:01:32 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

02:01:52 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:02:06 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I finished it... Oh wow I feel like a pumpkin."

04:17:26 You say to Lily, "I will always love you. No matter what."

04:17:43 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yay, burger."

04:17:47 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire giggles.

04:18:03 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "When is a hamburger not a hamburger?"

04:18:08 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Not sure."

04:18:09 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Never."

04:18:25 Lily says to you, "I will always love you too. I am so unsure about things with our pilot corps and the aEU government. I really dread the idea of going back home."

04:18:28 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "When he's a citizen of Hamburg."

04:18:38 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ha... ha... ha... ha... I'm dying."

04:18:42 You say, "Oh, gosh. Me too."

04:18:56 You say, "That's why I want to spend every moment I can with you."

04:19:00 Lily Kaise says, "I just wish we could go together if they send us out of here."

04:19:04 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:19:08 You say, "Me too."

04:19:15 Lily Kaise says, "I don't want to be with anyone else ever."

04:19:24 You say, "Me neither."

04:19:29 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:19:31 You say, "You will always be the keeper of my heart."

04:19:33 Lily Kaise leans on you.

04:19:34 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:19:56 You snuggle up to Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:19:56 Lily Kaise says, "I just don't like where things are going."

04:20:04 You say, "I know. Me too."

04:20:13 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh captain, my captain... the cannon has struck."

04:20:23 You say, "That's why I want to cherish every moment we have together."

04:20:25 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Oh my."

04:20:39 You say, "As if it is our last."

04:20:42 Lily Kaise says, "Our statement wasn't even acknowledged."

04:20:44 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Go you. Turn off your coms though. Don't wanna hit the mic button by accident."

04:20:49 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire snorts.

04:20:50 You say, "Because I don't know when our last will be. And I know."

04:21:05 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But but but what was I protesting?"

04:21:12 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "You were not. My cap>ain."

04:21:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yes I agree Love."

04:21:20 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh. Then I won't protest."

04:21:24 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Good."

04:21:31 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:21:54 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "You almost made me forget to repair hakeem."

04:22:00 Lily Kaise says, "If we are forced to go out separate ways if we are forced out of the Corps, I just don't know what I'll do. I honestly am not sure."

04:22:04 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Is hakeem broken?"

04:22:15 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I didn't break him."

04:22:16 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "He'll be fixed in a minute."

04:22:17 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:22:23 You nod. "Meneither. This was always my dream."

04:22:33 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Lah lah lah lah."

04:22:36 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "H!~, wh- ar!~'t @he*fo$ks on the Quantum "$ta=_l,ment device@"

04:23:48 Lily Kaise says, "Mine too. When I saw those starshps going and coming from a spaceport. When I would go out in the dunes and find the highest point I could to watch the stars. I knew I just had to be in space someday and somehow."

04:24:23 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Really?"

04:24:33 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm finding beads and balls, guys. Beads and balls."

04:24:49 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Anal beads?"

04:24:58 Lily Kaise says, "Those starships with their amazing speed and brilliance."

04:25:00 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Perfectly transparent."

04:25:27 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise.

04:25:28 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "T_e expiditi:n+c=e~^-ren|t ;@ the Q."

04:25:33 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "What?"

04:25:37 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "What are you going to do with them?"

04:25:37 Lily Kaise says, "Everytime I'm flying one, I feel so privileged and so lucky."

04:25:38 You say, "Ok, I'm about to turn off General. This is getting..."

04:25:45 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I agree."

04:25:48 Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

04:25:56 You turn general communication off.

04:26:12 You nod and smile.

04:26:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:26:17 You say, "And so ree."

04:26:21 You say, "So free."

04:26:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

04:26:42 Lily Kaise says, "It's so amazing to just take off into space at will."

04:26:46 You nod.

04:28:48 You say to Lily, "I feel so lucky to have gotten to know you and gained your love and affection."

04:30:26 Lily says to you, "Me too. You are an amazing man. Initially I was a little put off because I thought you were stlaking me as it seemed every time I turned around, you were there."

04:30:32 Lily Kaise says, "Stalking."

04:30:42 You say, "Oh, sorry. I wasn't trying to."

04:31:49 You say to Lily, "Yeah, I was rather glad that when I did try to flirt with you that you didn't strangle me and strand me somewhere."

04:31:55 You chuckle.

04:32:12 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:32:22 Lily Kaise says, "I've never stranded anybody."

04:32:40 Lily Kaise says, "I sure would have liked to have done so to a few though heh."

04:32:55 You laugh.

04:33:38 You say, "Yeah, I was rather tempted with one person, but I resisted the urge."

04:33:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:34:08 You say, "Because I knew Cesar would come after me and make my life miserable if I had done it."

04:34:19 Lily Kaise says, "My name is not Akemi and I am not into force and violance."

04:34:24 You nod.

04:34:28 You say, "I'm glad."

04:34:29 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh who did you want to strand?"

04:34:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:34:35 You say, "Taana."

04:34:38 Lily Kaise says, "Oh haha."

04:34:40 You say, "Takana."

04:34:54 You say, "She made it sotempting. She was just sitting there doing nothing."

04:34:56 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well she eventually was stranded in some fashion."

04:34:56 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Bach To Battle, Reprise".

04:35:06 You say, "True true. So I didn't have to do it."

04:35:25 Lily Kaise says, "Or oh wait do you mean Tatiana."

04:35:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:35:51 You say, "Oh, well. I wanted to strand her too, but she hated my guts so shee would have just tried to strand me in return."

04:35:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:36:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well Takana did do her own self-destruction so that got resolved in good order."

04:36:33 You nod. "EXactly."

04:37:13 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:37:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:37:19 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:37:53 Lily Kaise says, "I guess I have to think about what I'd do with Miss Asteria if we are sent out of the Corps."

04:38:08 You exclaim, "Awww, you two would miss eachother!"

04:38:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah she has been such a fun little companion."

04:38:34 You smile. "She really is."

04:38:57 You ask, "For almost as long as I have known you, I remember seeing her on your shoulder. When did you actually get her?"

04:39:00 Lily Kaise says, "I know they probably wouldn't let me take her with me. I doubt many other civilians have Tardict Lizards."

04:39:41 Lily Kaise says, "I got her coming up on two years ago I think it was in November. I'd have to try to remember."

04:40:04 You say, "Sounds about right. So yeah, almost as long as I have known you."

04:40:08 Lily Kaise says, "I was so surprised. When I started that trade."

04:40:14 You grin.

04:40:17 You say, "I bet."

04:40:54 Lily says to you, "So wait when's your second anniversary as a pilot?"

04:41:08 You say, "In 5 days."

04:41:12 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

04:41:15 You say, "Yeah."

04:41:32 Lily Kaise asks, "Is the 12th?"

04:41:39 You say, "The 14th."

04:41:43 Lily Kaise says, "Ah."

04:41:58 Lily Kaise says, "We'll have to find an excuse to have a party in between perhaps."

04:42:03 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:42:05 You grin.

04:42:08 You exclaim, "That would be fun!"

04:42:33 Lily Kaise stands up from a large leather couch.

04:42:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok 406 mil woo!"

04:42:44 You cheer for Lily Kaise!

04:42:48 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise has automatically contributed 4,060,920.87 AEU credits.

04:43:02 Lily Kaise picks up a compact white refrigerator.

04:43:18 Lily Kaise puts a compact white refrigerator in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:43:26 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm guess I'll finish this."

04:43:38 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

04:43:42 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:43:42 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:43:44 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:43:48 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:43:53 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:44:01 "Lips]," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

04:44:05 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:44:13 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:44:24 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:44:29 Lily Kaise puts a goblet in a small natural golden brown trash bin.

04:45:01 Lily Kaise asks, "Well want to head back?"

04:45:05 You say, "Sure."

04:45:11 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:45:13 Lily Kaise says, "We could just stay locked down here forever haha."

04:45:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:45:20 You laugh.

04:45:43 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:45:45 You say, "Nah, I have to go check the office once in a while."

04:45:48 You grin.

04:45:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "All right!"

04:46:17 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

04:46:18 Lily Kaise says, "Well I guess I do as well and lead others to cleans this place."

04:46:25 You nod.

04:46:27 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

04:46:32 You stand up from a large leather couch.

04:46:33 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:46:38 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Anything going on."

04:46:38 I don't understand that.

04:46:41 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:46:54 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

04:46:57 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:46:59 Lily Kaise glides north.

04:47:01 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]

04:47:01 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

04:47:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:47:03 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:47:05 You peer out...

04:47:05 
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

04:47:06 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

04:47:06 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.
Lily Kaise just boarded the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:47:08 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:47:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

04:47:11 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:47:12 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:47:13 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:47:14 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:47:14 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:47:14 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:47:18 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:47:24 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:47:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:47:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:47:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:47:40 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:47:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:47:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:47:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:47:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:47:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:47:47 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:47:48 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:47:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:47:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:47:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:47:53 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:47:55 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

04:47:59 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:48:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:48:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:48:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:48:08 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:48:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:48:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:48:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:48:25 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:48:25 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:48:29 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:48:33 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:48:38 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:48:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:48:54 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

04:53:54 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

04:56:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Bach To Battle, Reprise".

05:01:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

05:05:54 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

05:07:54 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

05:09:11 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:09:35 Lily says to you, "You know I hope we can be more intimate this morning."

05:09:38 Lily Kaise smiles.

05:09:54 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:10:17 You say to Lily, "That would be great!"

05:10:36 Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:11:14 You say to Lily, "Only if you're up to it though."

05:11:18 I don't understand that.

05:11:24 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

05:11:30 Lily Kaise says, "I am Love and only if you are."

05:11:33 Lily Kaise grins.

05:12:42 Lily gently rubs your back.

05:13:06 Lily passionately kiss you interplaying her tongue with yours.

05:13:49 Shule returns the kiss with equal passion, letting his hands aress you all over.

05:13:54 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

05:13:57 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:14:32 Lily Kaise says, "Aww you have a kitty in your lap."

05:14:35 Lily Kaise grins.

05:14:37  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, and a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

05:14:38 You are carrying Prissy the big violet long-haired felo in your right hand.

05:14:42 You stroke the soft fur of Prissy the big violet long-haired felo.

05:14:42 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

05:14:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:14:50 You say, "I do indeed."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

18:50:45 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Kim go EAOS then."

18:51:08 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Who are you having AEU then?"

18:51:12 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "I don't know about that suit, that why I said rental, but you know better."

18:51:20 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "I do."

18:58:33 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "My own fault, didn't look until way inot it. If I had been paying attention I could have blown the interdicters and got out."

19:47:38 Lily Kaise slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it and goes to sleep.

19:50:41 [MTTS] babyboy: So you lose a heap load of points for spelling one word wrong? I lost 75 points.

19:50:54 [MTTS] babyboy: Exploration.

19:50:58 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

19:50:59 [MTTS] canpher: I don't think it's been one word.

19:51:13 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

19:51:20 [MTTS] babyboy: I had it before the one word, and then I didn't have it after.

19:51:39 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

19:52:01 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Becons in forty-five minutes."

19:52:12 [MTTS] canpher: I doubt it's the only word you've spelled wrong in a short period of time. It happens. Just try to be aware of what you're typing.

19:52:56 [MTTS] babyboy: I try yo, I really try, but I don't get it, io've seen so many people spell wrong and not get points taken away, it's like they tagged me.

19:53:09 [MTTS] davetaylor: To be fair, a lot of people's typing has been awful lately, probably me included, sometimes we try to go too fast for ourselves.

19:53:12 [MTTS] usfolks: How would you know if they took points from others or not?

19:53:18 [MTTS] ricolachen: It might even be not the spelling. Check from a point center.

19:53:22 [MTTS] babyboy: Heh I asked.

19:53:36 [MTTS] canpher: I doubt it's an attack on you. I see all kinds of people misspell and so on. I do it more sometimes than others as well.

19:53:39 [MTTS] ricolachen: No one is obligated to tell the truth about if they've lost points or not.

19:54:00 [MTTS] usfolks: I would say to take canpher's advice. And ricolachen said what I was about to. No way to know unless you see their point summary.

19:54:07 [MTTS] babyboy: Yeah but this is frineds from way back when, they would tell me, that's why most people stopped playing.

19:54:27 [MTTS] canpher: Spelling is pretty important in a text based game.

19:54:40 [MTTS] usfolks: If they stopped playing because of it, then they may not be being honest with you now. Just a thought.

19:54:47 [MTTS] canpher: It's like if you were trying to make blue blood for a human in a graphic based game.

19:55:07 [MTTS] babyboy: Yeah but I don't get chance to correct it, most people get that chance.

19:55:11 [MTTS] ricolachen: Plus, you still don't check what you've been typing even on this channel. Just read what you've typed before sending and you'll be fine.

19:55:22 [MTTS] babyboy: I just think it's stupid.

19:55:25 [MTTS] usfolks: Check into it first.

19:55:33 Lily Kaise shrugs at a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

19:55:37 [MTTS] canpher: You're entitled to your opinion.

19:55:45 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

19:56:35 [MTTS] ricolachen: If you would like to discuss, I suggest you send a support ticket.

19:56:48 [MTTS] ricolachen: Calling it stupid on this channel will get you nowhere.

19:57:13 [MTTS] babyboy: Yeah I did, I told them my problem, nothing was done.

19:57:42 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

19:57:47 Lily Kaise glides out.

19:57:48 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

19:58:12 [MTTS] Jacob: I am curious why there is not a spellcheck on anything, like channels, or editors and such. I think this is one of the few places that don't have it.

19:58:35 [MTTS] babyboy: I don't think I saw that any where.

19:58:42 [MTTS] canpher: There is a wonderful little program called tiny spell. It's a spell checker that runs in the background. You can set it up to notify you of any spelling errors. You can even add to the dictionary.

19:59:08 [MTTS] Squidmind boots Jacob.

19:59:43 [MTTS] ricolachen: Plus, just spending a few seconds on checking what you've typed is sufficient enough. I'm not a native speaker and I manage just fine.

20:00:41 [MTTS] Squidmind: Communication always takes effort! Either effort on your part to make yourself clearly understood, or effort on the part of everybody else to work out what the hell you're trying to say. Which one sounds more fair and considerate? Spelling warnings aren't about spelling as much as they're about laziness.

20:01:33 [MTTS] babyboy: It's not laziness though, I always try to correct what I said, but the round time happens right away.

20:01:46 [MTTS] ricolachen: Correct it before sending.

20:02:04 [MTTS] canpher: You should do your best to get it right the first time.

20:02:50 [MTTS] babyboy: Heh I think people are just out to make you look like shit on here. Thanks for the grate help, you guys helped a heap load.

20:02:52 [MTTS] Squidmind: What that person said. Also, I've rarely observed you correcting yourself, even when not warned right away. In fact, most of your warnings are repeats of things you've been warned for before. This isn't really the place to have this out, though.

20:03:09 [MTTS] babyboy has left the channel.

20:03:11 [MTTS] Squidmind: For example... it's G R E A T.

20:03:31 [MTTS] Squidmind: Well, I tried.

20:03:34 [MTTS] canpher: Cool. Constructive criticism isn't always the easiest to handle.
