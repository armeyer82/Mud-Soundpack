Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
(60 seconds roundtime.)
Faint sounds and sensations tickle you to consciousness, as if they were coming
from very far away. A gurgle, followed by sudden dizziness.
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes, one containing Corey Matthews staring with
eyes wide and mouth wide open in a silent scream, a portable hot tub, a crudely
hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
purple vinyl duffel bag, Shule Elemmire's locker, Corey Matthews's locker, and
Natasha the large black felo here.
You can go north, south, and up.
You come to on the floor in a puddle of thick liquid, shivering violently, both
from cold and from the fading memory of utter terror. You struggle to rise, your
limbs shaking uncontrollably. You try to pull in breath and realize that you
cannot. Panic begins to rise.
open locker
Wait 42 seconds.
Your throat spasms abruptly, and you spew a long stream of clear blue gel,
emptying your lungs. You cough raggedly, drawing in deep breaths, and strength
slowly begins to return to your body.

lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light yellow shipsuit with yellow trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of soft gold boots. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a clear camera with a saucy strap, and a light
purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side. Her head, face, both eyes,
both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

I have one dark gray egg with a yellow embryo that I will trade for any dark
gray egg which isn't a black or white embryo. Other than that, I just came for a
shell for my organization called SEAS. I can also give anyone Light Blue, Light
purple which are eels or Light Green which are the Aquapedes or some call them
snails.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at Derelict Structure; Pod Receptacle.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown
rattan table with a glass top, an interdictor launcher, Nestor the humanoid
service robot, a small natural golden brown trash bin, a cardboard box labeled
'Here be keys', an orange plastic box labeled 'Felo Chow', a soft square dark
blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, a metal container,
a cute little plush calico cat with brilliant green eyes, a crudely hammered
scrap metal feeding trough, a cardboard box labeled 'Uniqua's Stuff', Magellan
the arachnoid security robot, Manx the little calico CatBot, Aisling's
workbench, and an efficient round egg storage container here.

Floating in orbit around a failed star is a twisted clump of thickly tangled

its twists and crannies, emphasizing the darkness everywhere else. Several
bulbous protrusions on the ends of the outer thorns appear to be open to space.
Smaller ships, or creatures, or something, resembling nothing so much as seed
pods from a tree, frequently jump in and attach to the structure, then depart
later with far smaller signatures. This photo appears to have been taken near

a photo of the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes" [inside a leather briefcase]
the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes"
It appears to be at Derelict Structure; Pod Receptacle.
You see a frigate here.
"Zéro Des Cartes" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
This starship has a very curious design for a spacefaring vessel. Three sets of
portholes reveal that it has a tiered set of three decks, flat on top with a
bowed bottom. Rows of weaponry are lined up along the middle deck. Smooth
tentacle-like lengths extend down the vessel from bow to stern, barely avoiding
covering the portholes, and come to points at the rear of the vessel.
The hull is gleaming and painted a dark red color with shimmering gold trim. Its
chaingun turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in shimmering
gold. The bays of its minicannon launchers are oiled to perfection and painted
black. Its landing struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a pair of plastic testicles near the landing struts, a pair of plastic
testicles, a very tall mid-deck mast-like structure, a tall aftward mast-like
structure, and a tall forward mast-like structure on the top, an aftermarket
box-like protrusion extends from the back of the docking bay, a small robot zips
around the surface of the hull, occasionally spot-welding slight deformities and
irregularities, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing, and a small shiny black circular section, a smooth dome, a
series of delicate antennae encased in a transparisteel dome, and a single large
port covered by an iris-style hatch on the forward end.

This room leads to the living quarters, and contains some additional amenities,
notably a tiny alcove containing a shower. A small keypad controls access to the
living quarters. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a
seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Derelict Structure; Pod Receptacle.

crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing violet and blue

[Derelict Starship; Tendril]
This is a long, organic-looking tendril which seems to writhe forward along the
central core of the starship. It branches off into other tunnels frequently,
some large enough to enter, many not. It's impossible to tell which paths are
dead ends. Also, the entire interior is filled with water. But there does not
appear to be much life in it, at least above the microscopic level. The water is
still, stagnant, thick with slime. Nothing moves. The ship appears dead.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted

a space imaging photograph of Derelict Structure Station
Floating in orbit around a failed star is a twisted clump of thickly tangled
thorns, dark and unreflective. Occasional highlights glint like dim embers from
its twists and crannies, emphasizing the darkness everywhere else. Several
bulbous protrusions on the ends of the outer thorns appear to be open to space.
Smaller ships, or creatures, or something, resembling nothing so much as seed
pods from a tree, frequently jump in and attach to the structure, then depart
later with far smaller signatures. This photo appears to have been taken near
Derelict Structure Station.
A hardcopy of sensor readings is printed in the bottom-right corner, alongside

the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes"
It appears to be at Derelict Structure; Pod Receptacle.
You see a frigate here.
"Zéro Des Cartes" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
This starship has a very curious design for a spacefaring vessel. Three sets of
portholes reveal that it has a tiered set of three decks, flat on top with a
bowed bottom. Rows of weaponry are lined up along the middle deck. Smooth
tentacle-like lengths extend down the vessel from bow to stern, barely avoiding
covering the portholes, and come to points at the rear of the vessel.
The hull is gleaming and painted a dark red color with shimmering gold trim. Its
chaingun turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in shimmering
gold. The bays of its minicannon launchers are oiled to perfection and painted
black. Its landing struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a pair of plastic testicles near the landing struts, a pair of plastic
testicles, a very tall mid-deck mast-like structure, a tall aftward mast-like
structure, and a tall forward mast-like structure on the top, an aftermarket
box-like protrusion extends from the back of the docking bay, a small robot zips
around the surface of the hull, occasionally spot-welding slight deformities and
irregularities, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing, and a small shiny black circular section, a smooth dome, a
series of delicate antennae encased in a transparisteel dome, and a single large
port covered by an iris-style hatch on the forward end.
A hairy black and yellow skull-patterned eight-legged ArachnoPal named Jolly
Roger skitters into the area.
