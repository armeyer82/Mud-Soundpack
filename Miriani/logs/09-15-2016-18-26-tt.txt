Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a white four poster rattan bed
with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small
seashell pink trash can, a dusky pink rattan cabinet, and a small oval turquoise
rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

a big violet long-haired felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in very long, speckled violet
fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. Its fur
is a normal short length on its legs and face, but elsewhere the fur is very
long, spreading across the ground when it lies down and giving it a thick fluffy
tail. The felo's short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked
white claws visible. A indigo, heart nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes
with vertical pupils.

with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, an insulated green
cooler, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a robotic chef named Nellie, a
clear plastic food storage container, and Jewel the large violet glowing felo
here.
You can go south and out.

You peer into stairway to the pilot lounge...
[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a
brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, an insulated green
cooler, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a robotic chef named Nellie, a
clear plastic food storage container, Jewel the large violet glowing felo, and
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo here.

The imposing mansions of Knockhill to the northeast give way to the
International Quarter, so-named in the early days of the colony when colonists
from various Old Earth democracies flooded here in droves. The resultant mix of
cultures produced a vivid mix of building styles, cuisines, and neighborhoods,
many of them clustered here along Shetland Avenue. Smaller streets lead off into
residential areas, while Shetland itself is lined with various ethnic
restaurants, boutique clothing and furniture stores, and small business offices.
To the north, Water Street is a smaller thoroughfare packed with charming
single-family homes and neighborhood eateries. Overhead, the combined Red and
White Line tracks diverge at a busy station.

old. The sidewalks have recently been re-paved, and are teeming with children at
play. Bluish-green grass grows through cracks in the pavement and surrounds the
houses. Towering elms and oaks are dotted through yards. The White Line train
snakes by overhead, casting a mighty shadow on some homes, but it is
speed-restricted in this area to reduce noise. Water Street dips slightly as it
heads north, and rises to the south.

Beautiful older homes line the street here, shaded by tall trees and the shadow
of the White Line train track, which comes to a station at the intersection to
the north. A small park to the west side of the street, bathed in greenery with
a small pond, is equipped with all kinds of playground equipment but sits oddly
unused at the moment. Traffic here is sparse and bird and animal life common.
Families wave to one another as they go about their daily routines, sharing a
genuine sense of community. The intersection to the north is busier, with heavy
traffic and scores of shops and offices. To the south, Water Street wanders
between more houses.

[Outland City; St. Jude Avenue and Water Street]
Here the broad expanse of St. Jude connects with Water Street to the south and
Gulch Street to the north. Stretching away to the east and west, St. Jude is
lined with tall brownstones and townhouses, dotted with freestanding
single-family homes and cornerside neighborhood cafes, bistros, antique shops,
and bookstores. Architecturally and historically impressive, these residences
and restaurants date back to some of the city's earliest days, and were home to
the elite. Broad, leafy trees cast cool shadows over the well-maintained road
and sidewalks, where middle-aged couples stroll from shop to shop. On the
northwest corner, a small coffeehouse oddly designed like a Swiss ski chalet is
packed with customers. The White Line rail curves gently around the corner,
coming up the verdant corridor of Water Street from the south and continuing
down St. Jude to the east, with a small neighborhood station elevated above the
intersection. To the north, the arid highland terrain of Gulch Street shimmers
in the sunlight.
You can go north, east, south, west, and up.

This intersection serves as something of a dividing point between the upscale

more utilitarian factories and warehouses to the west. Companies whose factories
churn out goods a block toward Houston have their offices along the far more
pleasant--and far more expensive--stretch of road closer to the river. The White

toward its junction with the Red Line. A station above is quite busy, populated

The relatively modest tributary of Callisto Street is positively dwarfed here by
the bulk of Shetland Boulevard's roaring torrent. The city's tallest and most
modern buildings are gathered here, trickling west, southeast, and south from
this epicenter of business. Gleaming spires of glass and metal rise up to ten
stories tall here, and every inch of them is used. The intersection teems with
people streaming from one corner to another. Small side-streets and alleyways
lead north from Shetland, but in general this is the city's edge; beyond the
Shetland ring, much of the land has yet to be developed. To the southeast,
buildings gradually decrease in size as one travels toward the river and the Old
Town. High-end apartments and homes dominate to the west, providing a buffer
between this heavy business district and the rows of governmental buildings past
Houston. Overhead, the local rail station hovers, suspended by huge plasteel
girders--White Line trains arrive regularly from the south, joined by Red Line
trains from the southeast.

working at office appliances. Beautiful landscaping seems to be the norm here,

in the sun. Front yards are filled with children's toys. Front porches boast

Factories large and small dominate this stretch of road; some are simple square
brick buildings with high windows, some resemble grotesque metal sculpture, and
some have made an effort at strikingly modern architecture. Most are operating
at full swing, though the busiest business around seems to be the junkyard on
the south side of the street. In fact it is not uncommon to see factory workers
carrying junked equipment, or cargo vehicles bearing loads of debris, on their
way to the yard. The area is entirely devoid of greenery, fully devoted to
industry. Workers at the end of their shifts trudge back toward Gulch Street,
waving and grinning at compatriots heading to the factories to take their
places. A large intersection to the east marks a notable change in the
neighborhood makeup, while to the west factories are still thick on the ground.

vehicles dominate traffic, pulling in and out of stockyards with heavy loads.
The smell of roasted meat and peppers wafts from numerous mobile food carts,
several surrounding the gate to each factory. Men in hard hats stride
purposefully up and down the street. Most of these industrial behemoths seem to
be operating at full capacity, though the retaining walls around several plants
show cracks and chunks missing due to wartime bombardment. To the west through a

[Outland City; Backroads Pizza]
The smells of pizza being cooked in a wood-fired oven dominate this cozy, dimly
lit space, lit with hanging lamps that sit above round tables with red-checkered
tablecloths. The adobe walls have been painted a deep blood red, which only
serves to thicken the dimness. In contrast, the stainless-steel kitchen behind
the bar and ordering station is brightly lit, and you can watch as the chefs go
about their business with great skill and precision. Despite its out-of-the-way
location, this appears to be a very popular restaurant. Open seats are few, and
many parties appear to be seated at the bar, just to get a seat. You can hear
the sound of conversation coming from the loft space above, accessed by a
partially concealed stairway.
You see a chalk board describing our specialty pizzas, a trash can, Hugglepuff
the little calico CatBot, a gleaming oak and steel Irish drink dispenser, and an
oblong copper still standing on a faded wooden pedestal here.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
a/@:w/xVg<Q)gAj:l+I$iWnuNq#=_}#yL0xyPvCe
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hey
pilots, don't forget to feed the furnace from time to time. Also, if you are
traveling via the accelerators, don't forget to have some EAOS credits on hand.
Last but not least, stay safe out there!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

Jq^_"%hncZ|&v5<HhlX,EWp'-i2i'4>l@P!\G<=8
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

Subject: QE Codes: Shorthand for Quantum Entanglement Messages
Author: Akemi Bando
Posted: 02:39 16 September 2316 GST

I've put my newest book up for sale on the space market, "QE Codes: Shorthand
for Quantum Entanglement Messages". It is 20 pages of common messages, topics,
and requests sent to and from exploration ships with quantum entanglement
communicators. The price is 100 credits.
For the sake of convenience, I also have put a copy of the book on the couch in
the QE chamber at the Accord of Free Worlds Command station.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Good day AEU! Our State of the Corps report
for this week indicates that the current term began 1 month and 8 days ago. So
far, The AEU has completed 19 out of 183 total decoy beacon drops, or 10.38
percent. The AEU is responsible for 0 out of 36 total destroyed RATS nests, or
none. The AEU is responsible for 1 out of 3 total salvage ops, or 33.33 percent.
With the new term beginning in a few days, I would like to see The AEU make a
concerted effort to improve on these aspects and especially in the area of
Ground Combat and leadership and outreach to others. [16:48 16 September 2316
