[MTTS] something: Especially with a screen reader though it's a slight
pain.
[MTTS] usfolks: For some of us it's an accessibility thing. Not a
convenience thing.
[MTTS] something: I use wordsearch just to stand any chance.
[MTTS] usfolks: And those of us who play visually but are visually
impaired.
[MTTS] moose: Also one thing that I've been wondering. Is SCANning
random? I mean, it doesn't seem to matter how close a ship is to you and
it also doesn't seem to go by class, or am I missing something?
[MTTS] alc_71: Sometimes, when I have a dozen ships, the screen reader
gives me issues when I am trying to find the correct ship to scan.
[MTTS] usfolks: Exactly. I have to read through the whole list to find
what I'm looking for. If you have 10 or 20 ships in a sector, you can
just forget it. Not happening.
[MTTS] something: And there's not much else that can be done. Even at 800
wpm, it takes a very long time to get through a list of 17 ships trying
to find a spesific one.
[MTTS] usfolks: I also have to scroll my screen up because I'm using
large text.
[MTTS] usfolks: Exactly.
[MTTS] B.A.: Maybe an add-on that reports the tracked target's status
periodically? Not as good as scanning it, but you'd get like "The
computer announces, "RATS Miner Epsilon-40825 has 0% hull damage."
[MTTS] moose: Hey I'd take that.
[MTTS] alc_71: That is a thought too.
[MTTS] usfolks: Better than nothing. I'd buy an upgrade like that. Or
something craftable. Either way. But something is way better than the way
it is now.
[MTTS] something: I'd be fine with that.
[MTTS] moose: Not that I'm complaining, but yeah, basically all of the
above. It likely gets super hectic just enough for the fully sighted,
with all of that being said.
[MTTS] something: With two or 3 ships probably not but I'm sure it is
with like 20.
[MTTS] B.A.: It does take a little practice to get decent at quickly
matching.
[MTTS] alc_71: For example, if I am trying to scan a squire, it's not so
tedious because there are only a few at most. It's when I have to listen
to ten various fighters that it slows me down.
[MTTS] usfolks: No, not bad with 2 or 3. But if you have 20 and you can't
glance over it like someone who's fully sighted can and have to go past
each one...it does make a difference.
[MTTS] B.A.: Maybe a distance limiter on the scanner?
[MTTS] usfolks: No, because you'd still want to be able to scan a ship
across the sector.
[MTTS] something: In case this helps anyone, when I first track a target,
I copy it's designation. Then when I scan I paste that into the word
search field which gives me the number much faster.
[MTTS] B.A.: An adjustable distance limiter.
[MTTS] something: A separate command for scanning things that are only 1
unit away.
[MTTS] usfolks: That would take me even longer and I'd probably get hit
doing it, and then again scanning the ship.
[MTTS] alc_71: That might work. You could set it before beacons,
invasions and the like.
[MTTS] usfolks: That's a possibility. But if they're swarmed around you,
you might still have 5 or 10 around you.
[MTTS] something: Yes but it's better than nothing.
[MTTS] usfolks: That's what I said.
[MTTS] something: Adjustable range is a disadvantage for when, for
example, you have more than one friendly ship cause enamies will be all
over the place.
[MTTS] voyager1000: When I was starting to suffer from worse eyesight,
back in 2010 or there abouts, I gave up squinting at the screen and
started using a reader just because it made text gaming that much easier.
The two problems are disordered lists, so being able to have the ships in
distance order may not be as useful as say, listing them in chain order
first. But then we're getting into making it way too easy perhaps. I also
tend to tab to my output and read up the list to avoid having to listen
to each line of text in full while checking tracking info.
[MTTS] usfolks: For me, scantracked or something would be the easiest.
[MTTS] usfolks: I should be using a screenreader, and don't want to go
into why I don't, but suffice it to say I have a reason. And I'm sure I'm
not alone. Something that would help the most people would be the best.
[MTTS] alc_71: What I do now is begin the scan attempt when I begin a
manual movement. Then I hope I have time to find the ship before the next
lock comes.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I think most would agree that it's also a challenge
to figure out which IFS ship you want, although I imagine that comes down
to memory for the sighted too, so I'm not so bothered by that.
[MTTS] ricolachen: I haven't had any problems with it so far. I scan too
often, and I don't get the number in first try. I usually bring up the
scan menu between moves, read the list after midmove then scan again. I'm
totally blind, so can't comment on people with sight.
[MTTS] usfolks: That's what I do alc_71.
[MTTS] moose: That's what I do.
[MTTS] something: Yes I do that as well ricolachen. Sometimes it'll take
two or three tries cause stuff happens while I'm trying to find it.
[MTTS] moose: It's a matter of getting into a rhythm. It's when there's
509473 fighters in the sector that I have a wtf panic moment.
[MTTS] moose: The problem I have is the scan order seems to change each
time I type scan. Does this happen for anyone else?
[MTTS] something: That's the point of this conversation pretty much.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It does. I was talking about it a few minutes ago.
[MTTS] moose: I'm still trying to figure out how exactly scan is
organized, or if it is randomly generated.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I think it does list in distance order, no?
[MTTS] canpher: I think it changes as they move.
[MTTS] Butchulla: If I ever see that many fighters in a sector I'd have
more than a WTF moment.
[MTTS] aaron123: The last ship to move is at the end of the menu.
[MTTS] canpher: So the ship that has moved most recently is at the top.
[MTTS] usfolks: If only it could be set in the same order as the SHIPS
command order...
[MTTS] canpher: The end. I figured it was one or the other.
[MTTS] canpher: I think SHIPS does list in distance.
[MTTS] alc_71: If you did that, you would only have to scan 1. Again,
scripting ease.
[MTTS] something: I wouldn't be surprised if someone who really wanted to
could script the system we have now though.
[MTTS] something: Making it too easy would get more people to do it yes,
it doesn't mean it can't be done already though.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It comes down to less people scripting versus everyone
doing it without any programming knowledge.
[MTTS] alc_71: It would take someone smarter than I with this sort of
thing. Which, that wouldn't take much to be.
[MTTS] something: Admittedly I pretty much know nothing about anything
programming related.
[MTTS] something: What ricolachen said.
[MTTS] moose: Yep pretty much all of this. I have no problem with how
things are now, it's just an observation from my pov.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I know how to create sound triggers and hotkeys, but
I don't use hotkeys here.

[MTTS] ricolachen: No more accidentally aborting the yes no prompt by
typing ETA. Love you hosts.
[MTTS] something: Yes again thank you.
[MTTS] B.A.: Could the autolander on courier ships be set so it always
prefers to pick ports the ship has permission to dock at?
[MTTS] something: It's much slower than just picking the destination.
[MTTS] something: Arn't you payed based on speed?
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks
like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance
goals yet!"
[MTTS] B.A.: Yes, but it's also useful for returning back to the ship's
home port. If there's multiple places to land, like at New Earth where it
can pick between the station and the planet, your ship might pick the
"bad" location.
[MTTS] something: Oh I see.
[MTTS] usfolks: I think that's only a problem for the EAOS couriers, but
could be wrong on that.
[MTTS] B.A.: It's still better to tell the ship what to do, but it's nice
to have the fall-back available if something goes weird with your
connection.
[MTTS] something: Oh.
[MTTS] something: Will you have to chose the destination for the autonav
forwarding thing?
[MTTS] something: Choose, even.
[MTTS] something: Or will it just pick one.
[MTTS] usfolks: That would be interesting for having it on a station with
two accelerators. But not sure why you'd use it there.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 106,438.51 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift
Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
[MTTS] something: I've seen chain stations where someone added an extra
destination.
[MTTS] voyager1000: If you have a beacon chain, you'd presumably need to
tell it which other beacons are in the chain in order to configure
correct travel in both directions.
[MTTS] something: Like the beacon chain to nq a few months back, at the
end there were two destinations.
[MTTS] usfolks: Ah. Hmm. At the end? I missed that apparently.
[MTTS] something: Well in the middle.
[MTTS] something: There was one that took you straight back to gateway.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yes, but those still only have one accelerator.
[MTTS] something: But that's beside the point.
[MTTS] voyager1000: So in a chain of three, you'd need to tell the beacon
in the middle which other two beacons you are transfering from and to.
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh. Back to gateway. That I did not know.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It can't go back where the ship came from, so in this
case it's just forward. Depends on where's the ship coming from.
[MTTS] alc_71: I believe it was stated that the forwarding will not take
you back to the beacon that you have traveled from.
[MTTS] voyager1000: A ship arriving at beacon 2 from beacon 1 is sent on
to beacon 3. And a ship from beacon 3 arriving at 2 is forwarded to
beacon 1.
[MTTS] something: Cool.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, I thought I heard that too.
[MTTS] alc_71: What they are saying would only apply if there are two
destinations to pick from. For example Orion has 285 and 287.
[MTTS] autumnrain: I believe I've missed something. What exactly is
autonav and forwarding? I remember my character jumped into a sector a
couple days ago and her ship started moving on its own accord but I
couldn't see to where.
[MTTS] ricolachen: Changelog.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, which was pretty much why I made the comment of why
we would use autoforward at the beginning of a chain. That would just
promote extreme pure laziness.
[MTTS] alc_71: You wouldn't want to use autoforward at the beginning of
the chain. Especially if it's a toll station. The autoland would be the
choice.

[MTTS] voyager1000: You'd still need to give details of beacons 1 and 3
to beacon 2 so as not to forward ships to other random locations that are
in range.
[MTTS] something: That was kind of where I was going with my NQ comment.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It's not random. It forwards to aligned stations.
[MTTS] something: It won't always be the case that that other destination
will just be the same place.
[MTTS] voyager1000: Ah there you go, I forgot about that entire alignment
part.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello everyone. First, I would like
to welcome Jacob Taylor to the pilot corps. I hope you will all join me
in giving him a great welcome. Then I also have the state of the corps
report for Friday April 28th. 10 days into the term, the AEU has
completed 3 out of a total of 46 decoy beacon drops (6.52 %). The AEU is
responsible for 0 out of 5 destroyed rats nests (0.0%). And finally the
AEU is responsible for 0 out of 0 total salvage ops. To clarify this for
our newer pilots, when you join a crew of an other alliance this does
help us still with conquest, but it does not count towards the totals I
just listed above. This concludes my report, and I wish you all a nice
day! Kim Saunders. [07:33 28 April 2317 GST]

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello all, I would like to take a
moment to welcome Rayferd Barns to the pilot corps. I hope you will all
join me in making him, and all our new cadets for that matter, feel right
at home. Some information for our new cadets I probably should have given
sooner: Ather Jamoa is our space defense captain and he is a great
teacher for anything to do with space combat. We do not have a very
active ground squad leader, but there are several of us who are quite
knowledgeable with ground combat, so do not hesitate to ask questions
about that. Some of us pilots have been at it for several years, so
whatever you have questions about, feel free to ask any of us. Have a
nice day! [07:48 30 April 2317 GST]

I was looking through my stuff the other day and found the g-string you
sent me. You know that I'm with someone right? Therefore, it was very
very naughty of you to send it to me, but don't worry, I'm not mad. I do
think you deserve to be punished for it. *wink*I, however, can't do it as

a photo of Lily Kaise
Lily Kaise is in the photo. She is lying on a rare black EAOSian
contoured couch.
She appears to be at Starship "William Dove"; Control Room.
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches
tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average, naturally shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately,
she has soft pale honey blonde pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is
oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty
teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and
almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and
swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a
solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows,
abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin,
both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left
uncovered.
