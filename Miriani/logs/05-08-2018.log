The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
You see an internal stun turret and a black leather crewman chair here.

Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a pale blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

13:10 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

22:29 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south.

22:29 You peer out and see...

22:29 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the four-person roborant "Realms of The Galaxies", the eight-person gunship "Insurrection", the six-person destroyer "Cherry Pie", the one-person fighter "Blue Dream", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, Mell the droid, and Katie the droid here.

hello all! I was thinking, and I had a thought about what i was thinking, anyhows, we have basketballs, and the hoops, currently you can shoot, and it's random if you score, or not, but I wish to expand on it more, making it a real game somewhat.
If the person has the ball in their hand, you can attempt to steal the ball from them, like in the real game.
when the person with the ball throws it at the hoop, there could be a 5 second period, where anyone in the room would have the opportunity to block the ball.
if successful, the ball could either end up on the ground, or in the blocker's hand, I dont know all the rules about basketball, but would be nice, add to rp, to have another game to play, the list goes on!
thoughts, suggestions, ideas?
