Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a high tech silver star print holovid, a pair of tan suede
clogs, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and Kiska the
humanoid service robot here.
You can go out.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

sit couch
You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock
Four).

A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps
its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "And perhaps some others on spare parts."
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for docking clearance.
A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free
Worlds port."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not a lot though."

credits / 1 megacredits
    This small battery array will not provide much power or keep your station
online for very long, but it is the best option for getting a station online on
the cheap.
    Power Supplied: 50
[2] Medium Precharged Battery                               15,000,000.00 EAOS

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Aerial fortresses can be stored and later retrieved from the aerial fortress
shop using the STORE and RETRIEVE commands. Perhaps this will be useful one day!
   Posted 6 days, 22 hours, 49 minutes, and 50 seconds ago
-----
Aftermarket upgrade shops will now actually let you retrieve the upgrades you
have stored! They will appear after the usual purchaseable upgrades in the
shop's menu when the ship they were originally taken from is present. Please
report any oddities or exploits, particularly things like being able to have two
upgrades which are normally incompatible.
   Posted 6 days, 9 hours, 22 minutes, and 4 seconds ago
-----
Owners of a ship can now clear the message boards of their ships with onboard
ship message boards at the shop that sells the onboard ship message board
upgrade.
   Posted 4 days, 19 hours, 45 minutes, and 57 seconds ago
-----
Ships are now no longer invisible just because they can't see anything.
   Posted 4 days, 19 hours, 31 minutes, and 28 seconds ago
-----
The game's main method of creating and destroying objects has been made faster.
Much faster.
   Posted 2 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 16 seconds ago
-----
Chained ships may no longer dock.
   Posted 1 day, 35 minutes, and 12 seconds ago

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a high tech silver star print holovid, a pair of tan suede
clogs, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, and Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo here.

definitely has its place in my life."

temperature, it's all about the taste and the strength of it."

good for you then."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nah, you don't boil it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We will."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Make it as hot as possibl."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No, you look after the coffee,
it is delicate."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "It was ll in the temperature
for the tea contest. Got to do the same with the coffee.."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait...look after it? Like...a
date or something."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Of course, coffee should be
treasured, it is very different to tea, that you do boil."

wake up so you can steer in the rift..."

need, Rose."

have at most 2 hours before I have to nap. That's not enough time."
[General Communication] Rose Lennex transmits, "Well, I need to finish this, and

that does faster airlock cycling."

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Wow, really?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "In addition to the exchange
pump?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I don't know. My status
readout now has something that says something along the lines of airlock cycle
time 99% of baseline."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Interesting."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Is that the black spores?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What's the catch?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm looking for an
extra-improved anchor plant."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hit to max velocity."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Goodness. It is slightly
faster."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Ah, I'm out then."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Would depend on what you used
it for."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, artifacting and hauling,
and I definitely want max velocity for those."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Ather may I come have a look as
a second pair of eyes?"
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "When is cycling speed that
important anyway? I mean, the pump is nice, but hardly something one would
need."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What is it?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, it's not important at all.
But you can't help what the plant becomes."
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No, and the choice is no bad
thing."

airlock to cycle now?"

grown."

fully grown."
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "What does it refer to when we see the tag
an Advanced - before suit names?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just part of the name, usually. Generally
depends on the tier of the suit."

such, just RATS and rental so far."

[Newbie Help] Rose Lennex transmits, "It shows on my cargo manifest, but not in
my hold."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's where it needs to be, then."
[Newbie Help] Rose Lennex transmits, "The felo will just eat it by themselves
then?..."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pierre...think we'll be back
from the fishing trip by the fifth of the month?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Is always difficult to
anticipate such things, Moosey."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I know that...but just
trying to figure out if I need to change some travel plans."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right so if you have a tight and
inflexible schedule, then best not to attend."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was just going to say,
there's likely no sure fire return date."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What Lily said, pretty much.
There is a chance you guys could be back on the fifth, but there is also the
chance that flow will murder you epically and you won't be back until a week
later. There is a chance, on this expedition as has been on other expeditions,
where you might divert to do something else."
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches out.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, I do know all about
that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Which is the awesome part of
exploration and I personally don't care for rigid time frames."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well if you knew then why did
you ask!?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Answer is definitely maybe
perhaps."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew sighs.
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "Chances are fair to get back in that time if nothing weird happens
and ship return through exact same way."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pierre's answer what what I
was wondering. Thank you, Pierre."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "But maybe I will feel like making a detour and heading directly to
Feng Wo."
[General Communication] Corey Matthews transmits, "I'd love it if you did."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I was ready to send Kim back in
an escape pod. Said she was ok to get back by the 5th and then started throwing
a tantrum about getting back on the 4th of this month."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, if you do, I can just
put off my vacation. The aquarium is more important to me at the moment."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Morris, if you have other
things that you need to do, the aquarium isn't going anywhere."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Everyone is weird except me."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah. Wasn't Melinda planning
another aquarium run if you're too pressed?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I am weird. What is wrong
with weird?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Weird is unique!"
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "Do note that there will be no spare escape pod to send random people
back. So, be sure to be ready for whole haul and full dose of drama."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I like weird."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I'm not exactly pressed.
I just wasn't certain if I should look into changing plans or not."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Your face is weird, foxface."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If Pierre decides to stay
out a few days longer, that may press you. Either go with him or go with me
later. That's the only advice I can give you."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hmm, I wanted to go on this
too, but am unavoidably away from 7th."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Better Foxface than
Arseface."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also any of you who have never
been on a glorious exploration trip who aren't able to entertain oneself during
long periods of deep space travel, think it over carefully before you commit."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I disagree with your
assessment."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But that's mainly because I
don't like people, and if they think I'm an arseface they will thankfully leave
me alone."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "You would."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'd be back by 9th too, and I
too can look at alternative plans."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "If that weird ship docked in aquarium start moving, I might start
chasing it for a bit."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not like I don't have a little
time to make up my mind."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Same."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "You are master of your destiny."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Maybe it will lead the crew to
the aquarium with elusive tenth species of fish."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
transmits, "Cyborg fishes."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Grand fishes."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We will see what happens,
if I am still glowing on the 24th."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You still haven't stopped
glowing with the aura of your riftbaby?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I have not, but things may
progress soon."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Orange is fine color."

an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet
of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
