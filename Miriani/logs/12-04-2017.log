["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

You see Kitty Mars (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) here.
You can go south, down, and out.

You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a white wicker wardrobe, a fuzzy suitcase, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and a pink suitcase here.
You can go south.
A red message board reader beeps urgently, notifying you that there are new messages in OOC / General, OOC / Quoted Out of Context, OOC / Gameplay Concerns, OOC / Announcements, and OOC / Suggestions/Ideas.

19:37 #$#soundpack status ok

19:37 Get what?

19:37 You remove a pair of brown leather tennis shoes from a black leather briefcase.

19:37 You'd have to remove a pair of gray sneakers with red laces first.

19:37 You stand up.

You see Kitty Mars (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) here, sleeping.
You can go south, down, and out.

19:37 Nothing happens. Perhaps you should ensure that main power is enabled in the SYSTEMS in the engineering room.

19:37 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:37 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

19:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 20, 1, 1.

19:38 You will once again see all starship movement messages. (Silent mode disengaged.)

19:38 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels return to their previous positions along the hull.

19:39 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

19:40 Current coordinates: 20, 1, 1

19:40 The computer announces, "Navigational automatic vector interface has assumed flight control. Vectoring north and up..."

19:40 You feel a mighty shaking as something seemingly large impacts the hull.
The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

19:40 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

19:40 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:40 You will no longer see starship movement messages. (Silent mode engaged.)

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background.
