["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

Section 2: What to do when your starship has been boarded by hostile forces.
--------------------
When hostile forces board your ship, there are a few steps that, if taken immediately, will at least ensure that the thieves will not get what they're after.

Prerequisite: Set an AUTH code in your control room. This is a special code that must be entered to abort your self-destruct sequence.
Step One: Begin the SELF-DESTRUCT sequence in your control room.
Step Two: If you have internal stun turrets, be ready to access their controls. Airlocks take time to cycle and salvage lines cause a brief period of stunning. If you're quick, you may be able to end the attack before it begins. Otherwise, get your stun gun out and be prepared. You may find it beneficial to enter your DUCT network and surprise attack the attackers.
If you manage to subdue your attackers:
Step Three: Immediately return to your control room and ABORT the self-destruct sequence. Continue stunning the attackers to ensure that they aren't presented with a new opportunity to get your ship.
Step Four: Move away from their ship. Land if possible.
Step Five: Repair your hatch, as it's likely they have blown the lock.
Step Six: Strand your attackers and/or, if desirable, steal their starship. Be sure to SCAN it to ensure they dont have friends waiting for a counterattack.
If you didn't subdue your attackers:
Step Three: Get your stun gun out and wait for th
04:45 e self-destruct sequence to complete.
Step Four: Get your salvage container to ensure that it does not get stolen.
Step Five: Start shooting. If you're lucky, you can strand your attackers before they get a chance to strand you.
Step Six: Feel good knowing that you deprived them of stealing your ship.
