Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Mining Site (-1, 2)]
This is a broad, unforgiving expanse of jagged rock and regolith. Lights shining
brightly from the nearby asteroid outpost are all that keep the surface from
being in total darkness. The light forms shadows with sharp edges, highlighting
every boulder and dangerous peak.
You see a central coordinator, a basic task drone designated Mu 365, a basic
task drone designated Phi 420, a basic task drone designated Xi 309, and a basic
task drone designated Epsilon 339 here.
There are 51 units of metal here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,
and out of the virtual environment.
I don't understand that.
