Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your
periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy
white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the
distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small white trash can, Shule
Elemmire's workbench, a clear plastic food storage container, and a Tardick
lizard named Isis here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
A Tardick lizard named Isis shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.
A Tardick lizard named Isis trundles slowly east.
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.
A Tardick lizard named Isis trundles slowly into the area.

The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
A Tardick lizard named Isis flicks its tail.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a
bottle of expensive cognac, a white time meter, a cream plastic box labeled
'Space Imager Photos', Kosmo the humanoid service robot, and a space imaging
photograph of a large gas giant orbiting close to a star here.
Simon Collins and Melinda Michaels are sleeping on a black leather sectional
sofa. Liam O'Toole and Nathaniel Owens are sleeping on a rare black EAOSian
