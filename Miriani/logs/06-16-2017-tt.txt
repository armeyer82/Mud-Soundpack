Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki
canvas sneakers, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to
possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[MTTS] kaite: Odd that this planetary system indicates Discoverers none'

The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new

Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.

A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something
hidden inside the endless webbing.
A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.

With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the
water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle
impotently.
The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul
screaming within.
Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
Several snowglobes stacked vertically hover past at high speed.
A hovercar spends several minutes overtaking you. Smooth, cycloptic faces peer
out its windows at you.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to
be in its driver's seat.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.
The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable
slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to
glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.

forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar
and cuffs and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and a layer of gravel on the floor
creates a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the
center is guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon
green plastic plant waves around, anchored into the gravel. A large goldfish and
several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather
sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple
coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small
fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient
moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron
orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic
paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars,
a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown
floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick
silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing
yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, and Manx the little calico
CatBot here.

A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.
Eli says to Ather, "I never knew that you were a fan of puppets."
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Everyone is a puppet, with strings to pull!"
Morris Corlew says, "Especially robots."
Ather Jammoa says, "We lal have our strings pulled by our governments. The
Mutuality pilots are...Morris, that's just stupid."
Ather Jammoa says, "Robots transcend."
Eli Grey says, "Well, I knew you liked that kinda puppet, just not the ones that
are toys."
Eli Grey grins.
Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.
Morris Corlew chuckles. "Robots can't even think for themselves."
Ather Jammoa says, "Shows how much you know about robots."
Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish
eagerly gobble them up.
Eli Grey says, "I'm quite thankful for that, if they could they'd have likely
decided we were obselete a long time ago."
Morris says to Ather, "Robots are programmed. They don't make decisions for
themselves."
Ather says to Eli, "Robots right now are amassing and preparing."
Ather Jammoa says, "They are going to use the artificial intelligence guiding
system that was once on the Jupiter crash."
Ather Jammoa says, "It will lead them to ultimate victory."
"There's a difference between 'robots'" Morris Corlew chuckles.
Ather Jammoa says, "Now there's one intelligent machine. I'd love to talk to it
again."
Eli Grey says, "Yes, but burning our own buttholes while lighting our own farts,
will surely save us."
Morris Corlew chuckles. "There's a difference between robots and artificial
intelligence."
Ather says to Morris, "An artificial intelligence system could theoreticlaly
upload itself into a robot."
Ather says to Eli, "Pierre will be saved above all others!"
Morris says to Ather, "Theoretically says nothing for all robots."
Eli Grey cackles!
Ather says to Morris, "Why not? If an artificial intelligence could upload its
personality matrix into all robots, all robots will have a level of artificial
intelligence."
Morris says to Ather, "It's still artificial."
Ather Jammoa says, "Hi my name is morris and I only like dumb felo woo woo woo."
Ather hmphs.
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Robots are more aware than felo!"
Morris says to Ather, "Robots can't change their behavior without reprogramming
them. Felo learn who they can trust and who they can't."
Ather Jammoa says, "And robots live longer than felo, too."
Ather Jammoa chortles.
Morris Corlew asks, "So?"
Damien Goss says, "Arobot actually can't since a robot is a machine, the
programming and or artificial intelligence is added later."
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Indefinite living is the true key to existance and
inevitably, ultimate happiness!"
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Damien Goss and nods.
Damien Goss says, "A robot is the physical structure software is put into."
Ather Jammoa says, "That just means that they can adapt better."
Damien Goss nods to Ather Jammoa.
Damien Goss says, "Well except to underwater environments."
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Hail the robots!"
Eli Grey says, "I'd love to see the mainframe for one of these AIs, I bet it's
enormous."
Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.
Eli Grey says, "Imean.. this thing I'm waring is pretty freakin huge and it just
stores a little bit of text."
Eli Grey pats a personal filing computer lightly.
Ather Jammoa chuckles.
Ather Jammoa asks, "I know, right?"
Ather Jammoa says, "It can't even do complex calculations."
Ather Jammoa says, "But, I'll tell you, for the notes I keep on it, it's a total
lifesaver."
Morris Corlew says, "Can't even do simple calculations."
Morris says to Ather, "A robot that has to keep notes on a computer."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Because robots are superior."
Morris Corlew nods.
Eli Grey says, "Is the AI that was on Jupiter Crash even of human designs? I
mean if it was alien that would make more sense to me."
Ather says to Eli, "Na, pretty sure it's human."
Ather Jammoa says, "Well, human design."
Ather Jammoa says, "And, I only keep the notes as points of reference just in
case! I actually rarely need to refer to them."
Morris says to Ather, "Mmhmm."
Nissi Valdaire says, "It was renegade tech which probably means Outsiders."
Ather Jammoa says, "I rewrote a bunch of stuff in the stupid upgrades book
without referring to my notes even once."
Ather Jammoa chuckles.
Eli Grey says, "There's just gotta be some alien tech involved somewhere."
Ather says to Nissi, "Oh yeah, true, it was renegade tech."
Eli says to Nissi, "Aha! Ok now that I get."
Ather Jammoa says, "All hail artificial subsumation."
Eli Grey says, "I just kept imaging someone saying "Ok here's your new AI
system, it can make decisions but unfortuantely it's the size of Bikura'"
Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.

tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a

Damien Goss steps south.
Eli says to Morris, "He'd have to probably b e alittle quicker, but I'll be
careful."
The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.
Morris says to Eli, "Slow bite's still a bite."
Eli says to a large snail, "You're alright , right little guy?"
Eli Grey says, "I don't think snails have teeth."
Eli Grey asks, "Don't they have like.. a weird tongue thingie?"
Morris says to Eli, "It's a rift snail. Not an Earth snail. Never know."
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
