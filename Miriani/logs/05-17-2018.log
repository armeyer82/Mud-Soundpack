["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white t
01:34 rash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, and a gleaming red security drone here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

03:05 The two-person asteroid hauler "Bluedragon Astroid" has entered Jumpgate to Central Jumpgate Hub.

03:05 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:05 There are no ships here.

03:05 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:05 > (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The five-person transverser "Starlight Express" has initiated an intrasector slip.

03:05 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

03:05 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

03:06 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:06 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

03:06 The ship is already on autopilot.

03:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

03:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:06 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

03:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:06 You can't power down the starship in space.

03:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:06 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

03:06 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the one-person cargo hauler "Tranquil Flight", the two-person asteroid hauler "Sugar Chitz", and the one-person fighter "The Falcon" landed here.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

22:33 Calyssa Calaway laughs over the intercom.

22:33 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

22:33 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

22:33 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

22:33 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

22:33 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

22:33 Rogan Steele's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "True, I love it when my girl wears her fish-net outfits."

22:33 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

22:33 Aaron Blade's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "like you did on quintsa?"

22:33 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

22:33 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

22:33 Cody Meynoso's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "hey, that's just quin"

22:33 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:33 Cody Meynoso's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "no one special"

22:33 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:33 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:08 You peer out and see...

23:08 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", the three-person voyager "Discoveries", the one-person fighter "Iron Madman", the six-person destroyer "Finish Them", the five-person transverser "Estimesta", the six-person destroyer "Quintessence", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Immortal Salvation" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, Mell the droid, and Katie the droid here.
You see Kelsey Hendrix here.
You can go north, southeast, and southwest.

23:08 You hear the sounds of somebody attempting to enter the airlock, but they're turned away by the locked hatch.

23:08 A message from Aaron Blade is piped through the ship's intercom from the external PA. You hear him say, "out out"

23:12 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:12 A loud rendition of Jingle Bells sounds as blue lights twinkle overhead.

23:12 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:12 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:12 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:13 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:13 A loud rendition of Jingle Bells sounds as orange lights twinkle overhead.

23:13 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:13 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:13 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:13 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:13 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
