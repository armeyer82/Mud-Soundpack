01:14 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

01:14 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

01:14 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

01:14 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:14 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:14 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

01:14 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:14 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:14 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:14 The ship is already moving.

01:14 The ship is already moving.

01:14 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:14 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:14 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:14 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:14 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

01:14 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:14 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:14 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:14 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:14 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:14 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

01:14 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:14 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:15 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:15 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:15 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

01:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

01:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:15 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:15 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
