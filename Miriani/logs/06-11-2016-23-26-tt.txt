Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your
periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy
white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the
distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a
bottle of expensive cognac, a white time meter, a cream plastic box labeled
'Space Imager Photos', Kosmo the humanoid service robot, and a brightly colored
poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Raissa, and a
Tardick lizard named Zeus here.
Nathaniel Owens is sleeping on a black leather sectional sofa.
Anfisa of Marzore is dozing on a modern white pod chair. Akemi Bando is sitting
on a modern white pod chair. Nissi Valdaire, Blake Madison, and Michael Winters
are dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch. Sakura Arakida is standing
in a stupor. Morris Corlew is standing here. Simon Collins and Kim Saunders are
sitting on a black leather sectional sofa. Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black
EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go southeast, southwest, and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.)
l lily
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a light purple shipsuit with purple trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of soft light purple slippers. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a clear camera with a saucy strap, and a Tardick
lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
A readout shows Asteroid Cluster 0775-7473 about 14.41 light-grand cycles toward
Galactic Northnorthwest and Up.
Sakura Arakida yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly,
indicating that it has finished sending a message.
You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate
from the reactionless drive.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.

You see a shiny yellow trash bin, a large stainless steel refrigerator, a
folding metal-framed chair, a stainless steel microwave oven, a stainless steel
kitchen table, and a sleek stainless steel beverage machine with purple accents
here.
You can go southwest and northwest.

You press a button on the front of a shiny red deluxe rice cooker with a golden
dragon on top. The device grinds for a moment, simultaneously emitting a burst
of aromatic steam, and a mound of hot chicken-flavored rice in a small bowl
drops into the dispensing area, which you promptly retrieve.

Kim Saunders takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Lily Kaise looks at shule and says ... uh you must have been very hungry!
Lily Kaise grins at you.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, looks like he was hungry
indeed."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He practically inhaled that although he
always eats pretty fast."

You laugh.
Kim Saunders giggles.
Lily Kaise grins at you.
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo wanders in from the southwest.
'I was hungry.
You say, "I was hungry."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Depending on drift, we've traveled about
27 and a half lTC since last charting."
'Ah, ok
You say, "Ah, ok."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That is a whole lot better than
yesterday."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So will be interesting to see what we
did achieve."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "When I woke this morning the NDB was
at 40 percent, now at 54. We must be getting closer."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The NDB is the same as when I left
Arthur Compton so my original guess that it is a little more than 60 lTC from
the Torus is probably reasonable."
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo stares curiously up at you.

You are receiving no signal from the NDB at Earthgate.
You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem quite clear. The signal strength meter reads: 54%.
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo wanders southwest.
Melinda Michaels strolls in from the southwest.
You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls,
followed by some scraping sounds.
Melinda Michaels sits down on a black leather sectional sofa.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Hi and byeeee roid cluster."

You wave to Melinda Michaels.
Lily Kaise waves to Melinda Michaels.
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "I can determine position."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Anfisa of Marzore presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the
starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Anfisa of Marzore removes a tyrian purple slipcloth embroidered with a nested
Apollonian gasket from a midnight blue backpack for a moment.
Anfisa of Marzore removes a slightly scratched and pitted tablet of transparent
plastic material dotted with points of various colour from a tyrian purple
slipcloth embroidered with a nested Apollonian gasket.
Lily Kaise applauds sedately.
Anfisa of Marzore looks out a viewport while occasionally glancing down at a
slightly scratched and pitted tablet of transparent plastic material dotted with
points of various colour.
Akemi Bando smiles at Anfisa of Marzore.
Anfisa of Marzore notes the current location of the ship on a slightly scratched
and pitted tablet of transparent plastic material dotted with points of various
colour.
Anfisa of Marzore traces her finger between two points on a slightly scratched
and pitted tablet of transparent plastic material dotted with points of various
colour.
Anfisa of Marzore quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 250.0,
-20.0.
Anfisa of Marzore flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control
board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Anfisa of Marzore removes a tyrian purple slipcloth embroidered with a nested
Apollonian gasket from a midnight blue backpack for a moment.
Anfisa of Marzore puts a slightly scratched and pitted tablet of transparent
plastic material dotted with points of various colour in a tyrian purple
slipcloth embroidered with a nested Apollonian gasket.
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "Much faster."
Anfisa of Marzore says in a Spinward accent, "58 light-trade cycles."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Not bad, we should be home Monday."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I figured 58.35 so I was close."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Well, depending on flow."
Lily Kaise nods.
Kim Saunders nods. "Let's hope the flow will be kind to us."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Kim Saunders takes several bites of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a
small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.
Kim Saunders retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of
the bowl and slurps them up.
Kim Saunders takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo wanders in from the southwest.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.
