00:56:18 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:56:18 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

00:56:22 Lily Kaise cheers.

00:56:23 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

00:56:24 You cheer.

00:56:47 Lily says to you, "You ready to rock some big artifacts?"

00:57:15 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

00:57:15 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:57:25 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:57:26 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:57:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:57:35 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

00:59:07 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

00:59:07 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.

01:50:19 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:35:02 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red refrigerator, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a Tardick lizard named

03:02:47 (20 seconds roundtime.)

03:03:07 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red refrigerator, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a Tardick lizard named

03:39:56 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

03:39:57 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Glyphmaker Artifact; Chamber] (inside a battlesuit)
The corridors open up into a wider chamber here. This seems rather more well lit. Miscellaneous supplies are scattered around, often tipped over haphazardly or spilled across the deck, as though someone left in a great hurry or someone else has already looted the place. There is an occasional strange crystalline container which seems largely intact, however.
You see the wreckage of Glyph Warrior Alpha and a space-grade detonator here.

04:55:38 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red refrigerator, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a Tardick lizard named Aste

05:41:59 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

06:23:11 (20 seconds roundtime.)

06:23:31 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red refrigerator, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go up and
06:23:31  out.
Lily Kaise (League Paladin) returns from deep space.

06:23:34 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

06:23:34 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red refrigerator, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, an AEU Combat Universalist, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.
You collect the items you retrieved from the battle and place them into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

06:23:50 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

06:23:53 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

06:23:57 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:23:57 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."

06:23:58 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:24:06 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:24:08 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:24:08 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:24:09 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:24:11 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well that was fun!"

06:24:16 The starship has left a unique area of space.

06:24:18 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

06:24:20 You grin at Lily Kaise.

06:24:22 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

06:24:25 You exclaim, "It was!"

06:24:30 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:24:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

06:25:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:25:04 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:25:04 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

06:25:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

06:25:14 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station.

06:25:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:25:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:25:48 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

06:25:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

06:26:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:31:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

06:35:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:35:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "'he made her scream!"

06:35:45 You laugh.

06:35:47 Lily Kaise says, "I so want to say that."

06:35:48 You scramble to your feet.

06:35:48 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers & Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers & Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, and a pair of baby blue leather clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes here.
You can go south and down.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact re

19:17:02 Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a body-skimming neon purple racerback tee, a pair of blue low rise denim jeans, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
19:17:02  holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

19:38:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:38:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:38:15 I see no "coffeecake" here.

19:38:19 You remove a large wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel from a clear plastic food storage container.

19:38:28 You grin at Lily Kaise.

19:38:30 You take a bite of a large wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel.

19:38:36 You take a bite of a large wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel.

19:38:48 You take a bite of a large wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel.

19:38:56 You take a bite of a large wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel.

19:38:59 You finish off a large wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel.

19:39:20 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:39:20 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.

19:39:24 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

19:39:24 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:39:34 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:39:34 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:39:36 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:39:44 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

19:40:18 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

19:40:18 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:40:23 You grin.

19:41:12 Lily Kaise giggles.

19:41:33 Lily Kaise says, "Ok so the way the beacon is oriented with respect to GMG, you need to set heading to 165 2."

19:41:41 You say, "Ah, ok."

19:41:44 You say, "Good to know."

19:41:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hello AEU."

19:41:48 Lily Kaise nods.

19:41:56 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

19:41:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hello Vern#s and everybody."

19:42:15 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

19:42:19 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

19:42:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:42:44 The starship transitions into another sector.

19:43:05 The starship transitions into another sector.

19:43:25 The starship transitions into another sector.

19:43:44 The computer reports the presence of an artifact.

19:43:44 The starship transitions into another sector.
The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

19:43:52 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

19:43:54 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:44:02 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

19:44:43 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:44:52 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:44:53 You grin.

19:45:03 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

19:45:03 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

19:45:05 Lily Kaise glides up.

20:12:54 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

20:40:31 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red refrigerator, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white microwave oven 
21:35:02 here.

22:25:03 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:35:29 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:35:39 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:35:39 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:35:44 The starship has left a unique area of space.

22:35:49 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

22:35:53 Lily Kaise says, "Holy cow."

22:36:00 You exclaim, "Wow!"

23:19:27 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.
