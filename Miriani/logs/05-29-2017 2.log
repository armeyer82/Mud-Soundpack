00:07:53 You can't go that way.

00:07:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:07:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

00:20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, right. I will keep an eye on her. And yeah, some people are very good at that."

00:20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "What is going on?"

00:27:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, what else can I do? Violence certainly isn't an option, so yeah, write to the liaison office, if nothing else helps, maybe?"

00:27:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "She had everyone upset."

00:27:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think that was Nathaniel actually."

00:27:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wow, ahum."

00:27:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Violence is always an option. You just have to ask yourself if it's worth it. Next time I see her, it very well might just be worth it."

00:28:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Again, she is making us look bad, and just when the program was opened up again."

00:28:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A few thousand docked points, maybe a no fly order for a couple weeks might be worthwhile if I toss her onto a temp station somewhere out of comms for a week or two."

00:30:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said, it'd be worth it to keep her off of comms for a week or two, provided no one is idiotic enough to go bring her back."

00:31:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, hmm, let's hope angry words finally did have an impact on her."

00:31:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But let's hope for the best for now. Maybe she fell off a cliff and out of our hair."

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:43:21 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:43:21 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:43:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:43:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:43:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:43:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:43:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:43:34 The ship is already moving.

01:43:37 The ship is already moving.

01:43:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:43:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:43:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:43:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

01:43:41 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

01:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "We don't do that. It is what makes us a good core. We work for our living."

01:43:42 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

01:43:43 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

01:43:43 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

01:43:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:43:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:43:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:43:47 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

01:43:50 Via general sector communication, Beacon C-09 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Dusty Reaches."

03:08:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:08:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

04:03:34 [Asteroid Belt Management Station]

04:03:34 This is an asteroid belt management station. Through large transparisteel windows, you can see the asteroid stations themselves glittering amongst the tumbling asteroids of the belt. The station managers need never actually visit these stations, however, instead conducting their business via a number of terminals.
The four-person mule "Liberator", the scout "Pathseeker", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are parked here.

04:03:50 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

04:03:50 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

04:03:51 You begin the launch sequence.

04:03:57 A launch trajectory is located.

04:03:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:04:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:04:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:04:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:04:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:04:08 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.

04:04:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:04:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:04:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:04:14 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:04:15 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:04:19 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:04:22 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

04:04:23 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" has launched from New Earth.

04:04:27 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:04:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:04:36 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Hi"

04:05:03 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:05:03 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:05:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:05:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:05:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:05:23 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:05:28 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:05:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:05:30 You peer out...

04:05:31 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.

04:31:51 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

13:58:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:58:34 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:58:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

13:58:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:58:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:58:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:58:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

13:58:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

13:58:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

13:58:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:59:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:59:11 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:59:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:59:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:59:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:59:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:59:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:27:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

15:27:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

16:27:48 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

16:27:48 You can go up.

16:27:52 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

16:27:52 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to battlesuit storage aboard this ship.

16:27:53 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

16:27:53 You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

16:27:54 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:27:54 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:27:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:27:57 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

16:28:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:28:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:28:10 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Friend but not an Ally transmits, "I suppose that's the dis' of it all."

16:28:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:28:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:28:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:28:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

16:28:19 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:28:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:28:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:28:22 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
[General Communication] Creator of Disunity Emily Ford transmits, "Could you repeat your last over, over?"

16:28:23 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 150,142.88 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

16:28:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

16:28:24 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:28:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:28:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:28:27 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:28:30 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

16:28:31 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

16:28:31 --

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:28:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

16:28:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:28:25 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Friend but not an Ally laughs.

16:28:36 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What is it with titles today."

16:28:39 [General Communication] Palm Greaser Kim Saunders transmits, "I can grease palms of others any day I like."

16:28:45 [General Communication] Creator of Disunity Emily Ford transmits, "Owens started it."

16:28:47 [General Communication] Emergency Responder Melinda Michaels whistles.

16:28:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:28:52 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:28:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

16:28:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:29:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "He probably did, I was including him in the comment."

16:29:05 [General Communication] Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew transmits, "Ahem."

16:29:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:29:09 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:29:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:29:11 You scramble to your feet.

16:29:11 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:29:12  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

16:29:12 You are carrying nothing.

16:29:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:29:13 [General Communication] Slack-Jawed Reg Tourist Lily Kaise transmits, "Just give me a pose!"

16:29:14 You exit the ship.

16:29:14 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]

Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega is sitting on a comfortable black leather couch. Gonzales Bourne and Damien Alexander are standing here.
You can go out.

16:29:19 You turn general communication off.

16:29:20 [Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

16:29:20 Sheets of tinted glass form a transparent window into the outside world around this crescent-shaped lounge, giving you a clear view to both the landing pad and the surrounding mountains and other Chetumalian scenery. Comfortable couches are spaced in neat clusters for pilots to sit in as they socialize and are brought refreshments by the attractive waitresses. Scattered close to the groups of couches are multiple holovids tuned to the latest news, captions scrolling around the edges. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

16:29:26 Damien Alexander waves to you.

16:29:26 You wave.

16:29:33 Damien Alexander takes you into his group.

16:29:36 You say to Damien, "Wow! Long time no see!"

16:29:41 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:29:45 Damien Alexander smiles at you. "Yeah."

16:29:48 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega tunes a metachannel FTL communicator and watch.

16:29:59 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega says, "They're playing with the titles now."

16:30:01 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega laughs.

16:30:06 Damien Alexander says, "I think this is fine, Alko."

16:30:08 You say to Damien, "Thought maybe you got swallowed by some blackhole or something."

16:30:12 You chuckle.

16:30:25 I don't understand that.

16:30:30 I don't understand that.

16:30:32 Gonzales Bourne asks, "Then taking 3. Is that so?"

16:30:32 Damien Alexander says, "Nah, just been busy."

16:33:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:33:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:33:58 [MTTS] alc_71: I know this has probably been discussed but how IC are these titles?

16:34:03 The starship transitions into another sector.

16:34:07 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

16:34:07 You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

16:34:11 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let's do mother nest!"

16:34:28 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I do want to do one someday."

16:34:36 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

16:34:37 [MTTS] voyager1000: If they were OOC, I doubt they'd show up on comms.

16:34:38 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I want my rats suit."

16:34:47 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's only tier 2, yeah?"

16:34:57 [MTTS] usfolks: At one point I was told it was fairly ooc but then someone once mentioned it's a button on the comm. So I have no idea.

16:36:35 [MTTS] nadira: I think that answer can be found in help pilot titles where it says that the IC to OOC barrier is a bit flimsy, so you can either see it as a title shown with someone's name on the communicator, or as something someone is known for, whichever is more appropriate.

16:37:49 [Starship "Tlazacani"; Control Room]

16:37:49 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

16:47:01 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

16:47:02 Damien Alexander's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Moderate."

16:47:05 You press a button on a Fringe Hunter, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

16:47:08 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

16:47:09 (20 seconds roundtime.)

16:47:29 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

16:47:29 (20 seconds roundtime.)

16:47:49 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

16:47:49 [RATS Nest; Drop Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This is just inside a location where the nest is open to space. Before you extends a series of tunnels, which are strangely organic-looking, yet clearly crafted from metal.
You can go east.

16:47:55 You peer east...

16:47:55 
[RATS Nest Interior] (inside a battlesuit)
This is the interior of the nest. There is no light here save that provided by battlesuit torches. Tunnels twist here and there, many too small for you to navigate. The walls possess a manufactured regularity, while the layout seems organic and unpredictable.
You see Sentry Horde Replicator and Enhanced Warrior Alpha here.
You can go east and west.

16:47:57 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Gonzales Bourne (AISSF Rental Advanced Combat Armour).

16:47:57 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega (League Knight).

16:48:01 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Damien Alexander (AEU Utility Combatant).

16:48:09 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega says, "Now I need a moment to fix stuff."

16:48:09 You wave.

16:48:23 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega springs into the air and does an impressive flip.

16:48:26 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega nods.

16:50:33 Damien Alexander says, "I forgot ta send the mule away."

16:50:38 You say, "Oh dear."

16:50:43 You say, "Go back and hide it."

16:50:46 Damien Alexander says, "Lemme go do that."

16:50:48 Damien Alexander lights his battlesuit's ascent rockets and begins speeding upwards.

16:50:49 You nod.

16:51:44 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega asks, "Ok tell me about the league suit, shule?"

16:51:57 You ask, "What do you want to know?"

16:52:03 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega says, "It's my first time."

16:52:06 You say, "Just keep them focused on you."

16:52:07 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Damien Alexander (AEU Utility Combatant).

16:52:14 You say, "So, flare first usually."

16:52:38 You say, "And keep using light abilities and shoot when you can."

16:52:53 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega says, "What is the differense between flare and directed flare."

16:53:00 Damien Alexander taps his fingertips together.

16:53:21 You say, "Flare is more general and directed flare is specifically for one target."

16:53:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Rock Duet". The organization has earned 486,246.44 credits.

16:53:41 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega nods.

16:53:51 You say, "So, flare as often as you can."

16:54:08 You say, "As soon as you enter."

16:54:15 You say, "Or move."

16:54:27 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega nods.

16:54:35 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega says, "Ok, let's do this."

16:54:39 You say, "Hang on."

16:55:02 Shule glances east.

16:55:17 Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega says, "Regen and squad."

16:55:23 You say, "Good."

17:56:40 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:56:42 Damien Alexander flicks a small switch.

17:56:42 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

17:56:43 Damien Alexander presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

17:56:44 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

17:56:45 You grin.

17:56:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:56:49 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks for the nest."

17:57:05 Damien Alexander runs a hand through his hair.

17:57:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:57:13 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:57:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Tlazacani. We read your Fringe transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of Chetumal City."

17:57:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:57:19 You wave.

17:57:20 [Starship "Tlazacani"; Airlock]

17:57:20 You can go out and enter into the ship.

17:57:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:57:30 You exit the ship.

17:57:30 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The two-person light transport "One Debris At A Time" and the four-person mule "Tlazacani" are landed here.

You can go up and out.

17:57:36 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:57:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:57:37 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:57:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

17:57:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:57:49 The ship is already moving.

17:57:54 The ship is already moving.

17:57:56 The ship is already moving.

17:57:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:57:57 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:57:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:57:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:58:01 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

17:58:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:58:04 You sit up onto a black leather captain's chair.

17:58:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:58:04 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:58:05 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:58:09 The starship is already moving.

17:58:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:58:12 The starship is already moving.

17:58:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:58:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:58:14 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:01:02 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:02:04 I don't understand that.

18:03:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Know it all Morris accused me of not firing torps but I was on the heavy vessels and you know i'm a light grid user."

18:04:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I jsut didn't choose to argue with him because I know better and I know which weapons to fire on which."

18:05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Wow."

18:05:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, he is such a know-it-all."

18:05:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "He clearly got confused because Kim only had chains in room 3 but I was definitely firingtorps but I kept missing."

18:06:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Shows his lack of experience as an engineer."

18:06:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, he probably did. Exactly."

18:07:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Did he listen to the ship's weapon sounds? If you were firing chains, he'd have been able to hear it too."

18:09:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have no idea but when Jason asked for chains I was definitely using chains and when he said torps, I was. I really don't give a shit though as I know that I fired the right weapons and Jason didn't even say to use torps on the last warship and It was moving around like crazy so it was difficult with torps which is another issue at times. Sometimes, as you know it's better to use a faster weapon but of course I used torps on that one. I'm just saying."

18:10:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "He irritates me when he makes assumptions without asking first."

18:11:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Are you all still working on that nest?"

18:12:30 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Who would like to have a large bell-shaped amethyst Jullybulb. First one who answers, I'll send you the egg."

18:12:35 [General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "I."

18:12:38 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Me."

18:12:48 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn, wasn't quick enough."

18:12:49 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Do you have an aquarium?"

18:12:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, he does make assumptions. We're done with the nest, but Alko sucks as a lead."

18:12:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes."

18:12:56 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Though I don't have a tank for fish or anything. So never mind."

18:12:59 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

18:12:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:12:59 You exit the ship.

18:12:59 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

18:13:01 Board what?

18:13:02 [General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "Oh, no..."

18:13:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

18:13:06 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:13:07 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:13:07 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:13:12 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm so."

18:13:20 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "What color egg is that?"

18:13:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have lots of space and none of those yet."

18:13:44 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm willing to give you each an an aquarium and some eggs but you need to take care of them."

18:13:52 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Of course!"

18:15:42 You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

18:15:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh, actually, I was thinking another thing, let someone else have that."

18:15:44 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "I meant the egg."

18:15:47 Board what?

18:16:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think it's Eve that's always looking for jellybulbs, but not sure."

18:17:01 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Jellybulb sounds like a glow in the dark. Fish."

18:17:03 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "God. I have a ton of those."

18:17:10 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "She asked for Dark Purple with butterfly wings and I only have live ones of those currently."

18:17:44 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "I don't have a fish tester."

18:17:58 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Yeah. Those biological tester things."

18:18:30 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That plant I bought from you would buy 5 of them nearly."

18:18:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait, you bought a plant for 2.5 bill Ted?"

18:18:54 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "They are half a billion, Ted."

18:18:54 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I do things voluntarily but not on demand."

18:20:50 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I've tried it. I didn't feel like I was actually getting anywhere with it."

18:20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ryo so I'll build you a large Aquarium and give you some fish eggs to start with. You will need fish food which is inexpensive and you'll need to fill it with water and you are on your way. Do you know where to buy the Fish Food?"

18:21:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thanks Lily."

18:21:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I run my mine by the seat of my pants. More interestin that way."

18:21:47 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sure thing and enjoy. I hope you have a pair so you can reproduce them."

18:21:57 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ahem or they will haha."

18:22:16 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Ted, get your cream out and help the fish."

18:22:29 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Like I said, I got eggs confused, I did have some of those ones, I forget their name, so I'm more than happy to pass it to a good home if one of the others who wanted to start out wants one."

18:33:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead! Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be annoying, but... but... oh God, I've wasted my life."

18:34:20 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:34:20 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:34:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

18:34:24 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:34:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

18:34:25 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

18:34:30 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire and Lily Kaise.

18:34:40 I see no "lily" here.

18:34:41 [Starship "William Dove"; "Hope"]]

18:34:41 You see a silky electric blue cushion decorated with embroidered pale blue flowers, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a large bubbling azure blue-lit aquarium containing violet aquatic life and round rocks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot here.
You can go east.

18:34:46 I see no "corpse" here.

18:34:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]

18:34:50 You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, and a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.

You can go west.

18:34:52 I see no "corpse" here.

18:34:56 a small bubbling white-lit aquarium containing crimson and blue aquatic life and round rocks

18:34:56 This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is closed.
Inside it you see a black plastic undersea castle, a small plastic statue of a bikini-clad mermaid, a dark purple egg, and a dark purple egg.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet butterfly-like wings, a tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and violet butterfly-like wings, a tiny startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet round wings, a tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and violet butterfly-like wings, and a tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and violet round wings are living in it.
That's five creatures, and it looks pretty crowded.

18:35:14 You open a small bubbling white-lit aquarium containing crimson and blue aquatic life and round rocks.

18:35:20 You remove a dark purple egg from a small bubbling white-lit aquarium containing crimson and blue aquatic life and round rocks.

18:36:12 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:18:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

20:18:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

20:53:56 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Can crew if needed."

20:54:06 [Tactical Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Unsure sorry am out of sector."

20:54:08 Lily Kaise says, "Weird as I put a stealth on the Asteroid station."

20:54:22 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Roughly. Was it two, five? Fifteen?"

20:54:25 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I'll go along."

20:54:26 [Tactical Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Can tell you when we're hauling back."

20:54:43 [Tactical Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "3 or so? I am unsure truly I can't give a number."

20:54:56 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Lily and I can both crew."

20:54:57 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

20:54:59 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

20:55:26 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh yes and I promise to just use lasers!"

20:55:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:55:32 You laugh.

20:55:44 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Meet at Earth."

20:55:48 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

20:55:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:55:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

20:55:53 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:55:53 You say, "Ok, let's go."

20:55:56 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

20:55:56 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "On our way."

20:55:57 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

20:55:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:55:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:56:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:56:09 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

20:56:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:56:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

20:56:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:56:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:56:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:56:16 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:56:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

20:56:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:56:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:56:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:56:23 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:56:26 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

20:56:28 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

20:56:29 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

20:56:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:56:35 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Cosmic Crossings" has jumped into the sector.

20:56:35 I don't understand that.

20:56:38 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello there, Cosmic Crossings! Welcome to home space!"

20:56:40 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

20:56:41 The computer reports that the four-person mule "Stinger" has jumped into the sector.

20:56:44 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello, Stinger! Welcome to League space! Make yourself at home!"

20:56:45 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

20:56:52 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep"

20:56:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:56:58 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:57:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:57:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:57:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:57:15 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

20:57:15 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:57:18 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:57:20 Lily Kaise is already in your group.

20:57:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

20:57:22 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.

20:57:24 You exit the ship.

20:57:24 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 148", the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", and the two-person Accord gemini "Cosmic Crossings" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.
Lily Kaise followed you.

20:57:25 The reactionless drive of the two-person Accord gemini "Cosmic Crossings" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

20:57:25 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

20:57:26 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, and a sanitation drone here.
Harley Richardson is sleeping on the floor.
Jason Rat is dozing on a cushy booth seat.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

20:57:27 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

20:57:31 Johann Schraft just arrived.

20:57:32 Lily Kaise waves.

20:57:36 You wave.

20:57:36 Johann Schraft takes control of your group.

20:57:39 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the four-person mule "Stinger".

20:57:40 Johann Schraft nods to Lily Kaise.

20:57:41 Johann Schraft nods to you.

20:57:45 Alko Delovega just arrived.

20:57:53 Johann Schraft takes Alko Delovega into his group.

20:58:01 Johann Schraft says, "Good enough."

20:58:03 You follow Johann Schraft into the stairway to the garage.

20:58:04 [Manhattan Spaceport; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
Johann Schraft and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go up.

20:58:04 Lily Kaise nods.

20:58:06 You nod.

20:58:07 You follow Johann Schraft aboard the five-person hammerhead "Wuthering Fights".

20:58:07 [Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Airlock]
Johann Schraft and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:58:08 You follow Johann Schraft into the ship.

20:58:08 [Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a decoy beacon launcher, a large leather couch, and a black destination finder here.
Johann Schraft and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go south and out.
You follow Johann Schraft south.
[Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Corridor]
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Allied Libertarians" here.
Johann Schraft and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

20:58:09 Johann Schraft disbands his group.

20:58:10 Alko Delovega says, "I saw cargo hauler coming."

20:58:10 Lily Kaise glides south.

20:58:12 [Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Living Quarters Block]

20:58:12 Lily Kaise is standing here.

20:58:20 Johann Schraft walks in from the south.

20:58:20 Johann Schraft walks down.

20:58:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:58:24 You peer south...

20:58:25 
[Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a large leather couch and a temporary wormhole drive here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north and south.

20:58:40 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "1 and 2 are unfilled."

20:58:54 Alko Delovega slinks in from below.

20:58:57 Alko Delovega slinks down.

20:59:14 You peer down...

20:59:29 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We got Josh."

20:59:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:59:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I would imagine that Johann will multi in the other room."

20:59:33 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I stole him."

20:59:38 Josh Preston's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "He kidnapped me."

20:59:39 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh."

20:59:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:59:43 Josh Preston's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he cackles!

20:59:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:59:49 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:59:50 You chuckle into the PA microphone.

20:59:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:59:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:59:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:59:58 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello stolen Josh!"

20:59:59 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:00:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:00:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:00:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:00:07 You sit up.

21:00:11 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 150,284.74 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

21:00:11 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:00:16 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep, she's engineering."

21:00:21 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:00:21 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:00:23 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:00:24 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:00:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

[Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

21:06:53 You can't do that here.

21:06:55 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

21:06:55 There are no other ships in the sector.

21:07:01 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Was about to start out with one it won't break my supplies bank."

21:07:08 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep, they jumped."

21:08:13 [Tactical Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Thank you."

21:08:13 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:08:13 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:08:14 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:08:15 The starship has left a unique area of space.

21:24:53 Lily Kaise says, "I left it in your pulsar last."

21:24:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:24:56 You say, "Ah, ok."

21:24:58 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:24:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:24:59 You grin.

21:25:08 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:25:10 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

21:25:12 You say, "Glad you didn't forget it this time."

21:25:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

21:25:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:25:19 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

21:25:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:25:28 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:25:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:25:29 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Full Dive" has jumped out of the sector.

21:25:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:25:31 Lily Kaise asks, "Did you want to go by Glittering or did you do that already?"

21:25:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:25:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:25:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:26:49 You grin.

21:26:52 Lily Kaise grins.

21:27:02 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Our awesome Navy!"

21:27:09 You exclaim, "I love our navy!"

21:27:12 Lily Kaise says, "Me too."

21:27:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:27:16 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

21:27:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

21:27:22 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We have the best!"

21:27:25 You grin.

21:27:25 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

21:27:26 You fall from Lily Kaise's lap.

21:27:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

21:27:29 You're already standing.

21:27:31 Lily Kaise puts Lily Kaise's workbench in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

21:27:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:27:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

21:27:31 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and Xavier the old big silver soldier felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:27:32 Lily Kaise glides in.

21:27:32 You exit the ship.

21:28:58 A launch trajectory is located.

21:28:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:29:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

21:29:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:29:09 Lily Kaise says, "I had 46 points. Not a lot but will help."

21:29:14 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:29:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:29:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:29:16 You grin.

21:29:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:29:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:29:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:29:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:29:26 You say, "I'm going to go convert some of my Teslabucks."

21:29:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

21:29:29 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:29:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

21:29:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:29:43 You say, "That should help."

21:30:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:30:09 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:30:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:30:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:30:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:30:25 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

21:30:25 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:30:28 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:30:37 You say, "Ok, I'll be back. Going to go convert teslabucks."

21:30:47 Lily Kaise says, "Ah ok."

21:30:50 You say, "Or exchange them."

21:30:52 You grin.

21:30:54 You kiss Lily Kaise.

21:30:55 Lily Kaise grins.

21:30:55 You're already standing.

21:31:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

21:31:01 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and Xavier the old big silver soldier felo here.

You can go up and out.

21:31:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:31:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:31:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:31:11 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

21:31:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:31:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:33:24 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.
