A row of large windows together with a skylight in the high vaulted ceiling allow light from outside to fill this vast entrance area. Along the east wall, a wide staircase leads up to the second floor and down to the starship hanger below. The entrance area continues north to a well-lit marble corridor and heavy ornate oak double doors lead outside to the front porch.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

Many of you lately have been submitting descriptions that tell the reader how they feel, what they think, or how they respond to their surroundings.  This should be avoided, always.  For example, the following should never be used in a room description:

You notice blood dripping down the walls and think that this might be an unsafe place to stay for the night.  You decide to get out of here as soon as possible.

First, the details should be provided without telling people what they see, smell, or otherwise notice.  Second, to tell them that they think this is a bad place to be is digging into their brain.  Don't do that.  And third, telling people what they decide to do, or how they respond to the surroundings is a huge no-no.  Let people decide for themselves how to respond to things based on their own character's RP.  Any descriptions submitted with these kinds of things in them will be rejected.

So I really like the announcements I was reading having to do with homes. I would like to see if maybe we can take it a step farther and bring in some custom objects. For example, you said how you wanted to make neighborhoods. I think it would be awesome if we could actually have a custom object in the room that would be the house. By that people could then describe what their home on the outside looks like with an actual object when others enter the room. I've seen this on a few other games and it actually works out pretty well. Also, the ability to have more custom exits that look like objects. Like stairs, doors, things that would add more detail in a room without having to just write a room description.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Architectural Design Simulators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Architectural design simulators allow you to build and customize property to add to the game. Through a holographic avatar of yourself, you can configure and customize a blueprint to your liking. All building commands work inside a blueprint, and no charge is incurred for your character in reality.

  Getting Started
Once you have purchased an architectural design simulator, you should BOLT it down and USE it. You will be presented with a number of options, most prominently to create, edit, or delete a blueprint. To get started, choose 'Create Blueprint' and follow the prompts.
First, you will be asked for a name. This name should be indicative of what you wish your completed area to be called. It cannot have punctuation save for hyphens, and it will appear before each room name when you are in the area itself. Once you have decided on a name, you will arrive in a menu of choices for which real estate you wish to simulate. If you are building this property for yourself, pick what type of structure it should be upon finalization. If you are building this area for eventual inclusion in the game's global geographics, choose house. Be sure that you have spoken with a host prior to building an area for general inclusion, as you will need permission to add a public area to a pre-built planet.  Public areas should be thematically appropriate and not offer exclusive benefits to the person creating it. If your simulator is bolted in a private structure that you are an owner of, you will also be presented with the option to import it in as a new design. This may be useful for experimenting with possible new additions to your current structure. Submissions of imported designs will not, however, usually be accepted. If you wish to update your current design, you need to build it by hand.
Finally, you will be asked if you want to password protect this blueprint. If other people have access to the simulator and you do not want them modifying the design, choose yes and enter a password. Passwords are encrypted one-way, so if you forget your password, it cannot be read or recovered by a host. Keep this in mind when adding a password.

  Building
Once you have finished configuring your blueprint, you will be connected to a holographic avatar. Your avatar is naked, and thus lacks a communicator, message board reader or other gadgets. You can use the NEWBIE channel or the DESIGN channel. The design channel is IC and allows you to speak to any other avatars that may be connected to the blueprint. It should not be used to circumvent communicators.
Most building commands work inside of a blueprint. For more detail on these, review HELP BUILDING COMMANDS. You cannot create or submit stores inside of a blueprint, nor can you access authorization lists or use security center functions. Similarly, holographic avatars can move through any biometrically locked exit without requiring authorization. There are some commands that are exclusive to building avatars, which are listed below.

DESIGN <text | who> - Speak on the design channel. This channel employs minimal filtration and is for conversing about your design with other avatars that may be connected. It should remain in character. Providing the [who] argument will show other avatars that are connected to your design.
@DESCRIBE/DESCRIBE <object | here> as <text> - Describe <object>. Using "here" as the object will describe the room you are standing in. If you wish to have a multi-line description, use the syntax DESCRIBE <object> by itself instead.
CREATE <name> - Create a custom item. Custom items can be props, containers or furniture and there is a limit; 5 for a house, 10 for a space station, 15 for a moon and 20 for a planet. Each item will add 5,000,000 credits to the final cost of the blueprint.
DESTROY <item> - Destroy an item. This is not reversible.
DIG-GO <exit name> to <room> - Digs a go exit with the provided name. If you don't provide a name, the room name will default to "New Room".
DEMOLISH-GO <go exit> - Demolishes a go exit. The other side must not have any connecting rooms.
ENVIRONMENT (or ENV) - Alter the environment of a room.
EXIT-MESSAGES (or EXITMSG) <exit> - Set messages that are shown when moving through an exit. Pronouns and other substitutions can be used here.
PRONOUNS - Show a list of pronouns that can be used in various messages.
LIGHTING (or LIGHTS) - Turn lighting on or off in a room. Rooms that are not lit will not show descriptions or contents.
DOORTYPE - Change the door type for an entrance accessible with the ENTER-command. You must be standing in the room with the entrance.
ROOMFIX (or DEMOLISH HERE) - Remove a room that has no exits, go exits, or enter exits and move your avatar back to the first room of the blueprint.
ROOMS - View all rooms in your blueprint.
WORTH - View a cost breakdown for the entire blueprint. This is how much you will need to pay once you wish to make this design a reality.
ZAP (or TELEPORT) <room name> - Instantly transport your avatar to <room name>.
ADDNOTE <text> - Add notes for a specific room. Notes can be deleted or reviewed through the manage notes function when modifying your blueprint. You should leave a note in the room that you wish to set as a docking bay or landing pad if you are making anything other than a house.
END - Terminates the simulation.

  Further Customization
The second option in the initial menu allows one to edit blueprint parameters. If your blueprint is password protected, you will need the password to access and change settings.

Change Parent - Change the type of structure that governs your design.
Enable/Disable Map - Toggle specific mapping on your blueprint. This defines whether people can type MAP [room] to receive directions to a specific room.
Rename - Change the name of a blueprint.
Add/Change Password - Change an existing password. If you have not set a password, this option will guide you through adding one. If you wish to clear the password, type the old password and then leave the new password field blank.
Manage Notes - Add or delete attached notes. Notes should detail special accommodations for your structure such as lifts and should also include where you wish to place it in the real game world.
Set Sector Coordinates - Set coordinates for a private station, moon, or planet. These will be the coordinates that your new structure occupies in the sector once it has been physically built.

  Submitting Blueprints
Once you have finished your blueprint, you should submit it. Keep in mind that you cannot submit a design if you lack the points to own it. Submission can be done through the simulator menu and puts your design in a queue for hosts to review. While your blueprint is in the queue you will not be able to access or modify it. Once it has been approved, a host will approach you to take payment and implement your design into the world. Be sure to include painful amounts of detail in the notes attached, lest it not be done exactly how you intended.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-toole

Greetings humans,

    There has been an increase lately of people submitting descriptions that presume too much, telling people what they notice, how they feel, what they think, etc.  As stated in post 62388, these types of things are unacceptable and will be rejected.  The easiest way to prevent this is to avoid using the word 'you' in any description.  Please note that replacing the word 'you' with the word 'one' does not automatically eliminate the problem.  The result is still the same.  Please be careful of this.

    Another thing that has been popping up a lot lately is that some of you are beginning your descriptions with action statements.  For example:

Stepping into the hallway, the floors are covered with a lush blue carpet and the walls are lined with fanciful tapestries of varying colors and patterns.

    The beginning of that sentence, (Stepping into the hallway,) is the description of an action being taken, presumably by the player.  Not only is this also a presumption that the player is stepping instead of rolling, crawling, running, cartwheeling, or anything else, but it falls outside the bounds of what is asked f
04:50 or.  When describing a room or setting in Miriani, you are being asked to provide a description of the room or setting only, not the player who reads the description or that player's actions.  Please keep this in mind when submitting descriptions.

Thank you.

This is for those who missed the changelog entry, or don't read the changelog. Shame on you. Shame!

To make the whole policy acception concept less heavy-handed, alliance choosing no longer checks to see if new characters have accepted the policies, and the reminder is now on a one hour interval and doesn't send to newbies. You should still read them all and accept them when you have time, of course.

To clarify, you can read the policies when and where you wish, during or after character creation. What policies you have read will still be tracked, and you will still need to accept them at some point unless you want to see a spammy reminder every hour if you're not a newbie.

For those of you who maintain soundpacks, I would like to ask you not to gag the policy reminders. This system will be useless if you gag them. Thanks.

Many of you lately have been submitting descriptions that tell the reader how they feel, what they think, or how they respond to their surroundings.  This should be avoided, always.  For example, the following should never be used in a room description:

You notice blood dripping down the walls and think that this might be an unsafe place to stay for the night.  You decide to get out of here as soon as possible.

First, the details should be provided without telling people what they see, smell, or otherwise notice.  Second, to tell them that they think this is a bad place to be is digging into their brain.  Don't do that.  And third, telling people what they decide to do, or how they respond to the surroundings is a huge no-no.  Let people decide for themselves how to respond to things based on their own character's RP.  Any descriptions submitted with these kinds of things in them will be rejected.

This is just a quick reminder to all players submitting descriptions for houses and apartments. When submitting, please make sure to use proper grammar, punctuation and capitalization. A large amount of descriptions have come through lately that were not within these guidelines and had to be rejected, so please, if you want your description approved, just make sure to do those three simple things.

Greetings humans,

    There has been an increase lately of people submitting descriptions that presume too much, telling people what they notice, how they feel, what they think, etc.  As stated in post 62388, these types of things are unacceptable and will be rejected.  The easiest way to prevent this is to avoid using the word 'you' in any description.  Please note that replacing the word 'you' with the word 'one' does not automatically eliminate the problem.  The result is still the same.  Please be careful of this.

    Another thing that has been popping up a lot lately is that some of you are beginning your descriptions with action statements.  For example:

Stepping into the hallway, the floors are covered with a lush blue carpet and the walls are lined with fanciful tapestries of varying colors and patterns.

    The beginning of that sentence, (Stepping into the hallway,) is the description of an action being taken, presumably by the player.  Not only is this also a presumption that the player is stepping instead of rolling, crawling, running, cartwheeling, or anything else, but it falls outside the bounds of what is asked f
05:23 or.  When describing a room or setting in Miriani, you are being asked to provide a description of the room or setting only, not the player who reads the description or that player's actions.  Please keep this in mind when submitting descriptions.

Thank you.

Many of you lately have been submitting descriptions that tell the reader how they feel, what they think, or how they respond to their surroundings.  This should be avoided, always.  For example, the following should never be used in a room description:

You notice blood dripping down the walls and think that this might be an unsafe place to stay for the night.  You decide to get out of here as soon as possible.

First, the details should be provided without telling people what they see, smell, or otherwise notice.  Second, to tell them that they think this is a bad place to be is digging into their brain.  Don't do that.  And third, telling people what they decide to do, or how they respond to the surroundings is a huge no-no.  Let people decide for themselves how to respond to things based on their own character's RP.  Any descriptions submitted with these kinds of things in them will be rejected.

-------------------------------------------
It's that time again, dear friends! Time to talk about room descriptions!

We've been noticing an alarming amount of room descriptions being submitted that contain extremely bad spelling and/or grammar. Sometimes words are used incorrectly. Sometimes people write letters in place of words such as u, r, and b. While this may be acceptable when chatting with your friends on your favorite instant messaging client or texting on your smartphone, this sort of writing is not acceptable when submitting room descriptions in Miriani. We won't name names. You know who you are.

We recognize that not everyone who plays here is going to have a perfect grasp of the English language or grammar. I sure don't. Some of you from overseas may have English as your second language. Typos happen. Spelling mistakes happen. We'll gladly edit your descriptions to make them a bit more presentable if we see that you're putting in an effort to write them well.

However, our jobs are made much more difficult when people can't be bothered to even put in an effort to write properly. In addition to making sure descriptions make sense for their locations, we also have to make sure they use as much proper spelling and grammar as possible. If we see a description with a ton of mistakes and bad grammar, we're more than likely going to just deny it on principle.

So what can you do to insure your descriptions have a better chance of being approved?

Proofread your work. Go through and check for spacing and capitalization errors, typos, misspellings, etc. Use a spell checking program to help you if you have one. If you don't have one, obtain one. Google can also be used to spell check in some cases. In this day in age, there should be no excuse not to spell check your work or look up a word. Miriani also has a spell checker with a rather impressive dictionary, but it isn't perfect. If you don't feel able to do this yourself, have a friend help. Even us hosts have to proofread, so don't feel like I'm looking down on you. We're all human here. I think...

Write words out. Don't use u in place of you, r in place of are, b in place of be, etc. Keep that to text messages if you must write that way at all. Failing to write whole words will probably get your description denied on sight without remorse.

There are more tips for writing descriptions in posts 62388 and 75561.

But Mitchell, I'm lazy! I don't have the patience for all that!

If this is the case, then I'd recommend against submitting descriptions altogether. If you can't put a reasonable effort into writing and expect us to fix everything for
05:25  you, then please don't bother. Ask someone to describe for you. I believe there are people who do so for an in character fee. Just make sure they're willing and able to put in the effort to write properly. This isn't meant to discourage anyone, only to emphasize how serious this issue is. We have you submit descriptions for approval for a reason.

Thanks for your understanding and continued support!

P.S. If you're stressed, pet a cat.

11:06 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a white wicker wardrobe, a pink suitcase, and a pair of brown leather tennis shoes here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Architectural Design Simulators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Architectural design simulators allow you to build and customize property to add to the game. Through a holographic avatar of yourself, you can configure and customize a blueprint to your liking. All building commands work inside a blueprint, and no charge is incurred for your character in reality.

  Getting Started
Once you have purchased an architectural design simulator, you should BOLT it down and USE it. You will be presented with a number of options, most prominently to create, edit, or delete a blueprint. To get started, choose 'Create Blueprint' and follow the prompts.
First, you will be asked for a name. This name should be indicative of what you wish your completed area to be called. It cannot have punctuation save for hyphens, and it will appear before each room name when you are in the area itself. Once you have decided on a name, you will arrive in a menu of choices for which real estate you wish to simulate. If you are building this property for yourself, pick what type of structure it should be upon finalization. If you are building this area for eventual inclusion in the game's global geographics, choose house. Be sure that you have spoken with a host prior to building an area for general inclusion, as you will need permission to add a public area to a pre-built planet.  Public areas should be thematically appropriate and not offer exclusive benefits to the person creating it. If your simulator is bolted in a private structure that you are an owner of, you will also be presented with the option to import it in as a new design. This may be useful for experimenting with possible new additions to your current structure. Submissions of imported designs will not, however, usually be accepted. If you wish to update your current design, you need to build it by hand.
Finally, you will be asked if you want to password protect this blueprint. If other people have access to the simulator and you do not want them modifying the design, choose yes and enter a password. Passwords are encrypted one-way, so if you forget your password, it cannot be read or recovered by a host. Keep this in mind when adding a password.

  Building
Once you have finished configuring your blueprint, you will be connected to a holographic avatar. Your avatar is naked, and thus lacks a communicator, message board reader or other gadgets. You can use the NEWBIE channel or the DESIGN channel. The design channel is IC and allows you to speak to any other avatars that may be connected to the blueprint. It should not be used to circumvent communicators.
Most building commands work inside of a blueprint. For more detail on these, review HELP BUILDING COMMANDS. You cannot create or submit stores inside of a blueprint, nor can you access authorization lists or use security center functions. Similarly, holographic avatars can move through any biometrically locked exit without requiring authorization. There are some commands that are exclusive to building avatars, which are listed below.

DESIGN <text | who> - Speak on the design channel. This channel employs minimal filtration and is for conversing about your design with other avatars that may be connected. It should remain in character. Providing the [who] argument will show other avatars that are connected to your design.
@DESCRIBE/DESCRIBE <object | here> as <text> - Describe <object>. Using "here" as the object will describe the room you are standing in. If you wish to have a multi-line description, use the syntax DESCRIBE <object> by itself instead.
CREATE <name> - Create a custom item. Custom items can be props, containers or furniture and there is a limit; 5 for a house, 10 for a space station, 15 for a moon and 20 for a planet. Each item will add 5,000,000 credits to the final cost of the blueprint.
DESTROY <item> - Destroy an item. This is not reversible.
DIG-GO <exit name> to <room> - Digs a go exit with the provided name. If you don't provide a name, the room name will default to "New Room".
DEMOLISH-GO <go exit> - Demolishes a go exit. The other side must not have any connecting rooms.
ENVIRONMENT (or ENV) - Alter the environment of a room.
EXIT-MESSAGES (or EXITMSG) <exit> - Set messages that are shown when moving through an exit. Pronouns and other substitutions can be used here.
PRONOUNS - Show a list of pronouns that can be used in various messages.
LIGHTING (or LIGHTS) - Turn lighting on or off in a room. Rooms that are not lit will not show descriptions or contents.
DOORTYPE - Change the door type for an entrance accessible with the ENTER-command. You must be standing in the room with the entrance.
ROOMFIX (or DEMOLISH HERE) - Remove a room that has no exits, go exits, or enter exits and move your avatar back to the first room of the blueprint.
ROOMS - View all rooms in your blueprint.
WORTH - View a cost breakdown for the entire blueprint. This is how much you will need to pay once you wish to make this design a reality.
ZAP (or TELEPORT) <room name> - Instantly transport your avatar to <room name>.
ADDNOTE <text> - Add notes for a specific room. Notes can be deleted or reviewed through the manage notes function when modifying your blueprint. You should leave a note in the room that you wish to set as a docking bay or landing pad if you are making anything other than a house.
END - Terminates the simulation.

  Further Customization
The second option in the initial menu allows one to edit blueprint parameters. If your blueprint is password protected, you will need the password to access and change settings.

Change Parent - Change the type of structure that governs your design.
Enable/Disable Map - Toggle specific mapping on your blueprint. This defines whether people can type MAP [room] to receive directions to a specific room.
Rename - Change the name of a blueprint.
Add/Change Password - Change an existing password. If you have not set a password, this option will guide you through adding one. If you wish to clear the password, type the old password and then leave the new password field blank.
Manage Notes - Add or delete attached notes. Notes should detail special accommodations for your structure such as lifts and should also include where you wish to place it in the real game world.
Set Sector Coordinates - Set coordinates for a private station, moon, or planet. These will be the coordinates that your new structure occupies in the sector once it has been physically built.

  Submitting Blueprints
Once you have finished your blueprint, you should submit it. Keep in mind that you cannot submit a design if you lack the points to own it. Submission can be done through the simulator menu and puts your design in a queue for hosts to review. While your blueprint is in the queue you will not be able to access or modify it. Once it has been approved, a host will approach you to take payment and implement your design into the world. Be sure to include painful amounts of detail in the notes attached, lest it not be done exactly how you intended.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent star

I think there should be a house limit.  If planets are like Desolo where the house numbers are limited, it seems that people should be able to buy a limited number of houses so that those who don't have houses can do so in a place of their choosing without there being 50 houses owned by the same person.  Sorry, I know this might not make sense, and maybe someone else can put things more eloquently than I can ATM.

I think there should be a limit as to how many houses someone owns on one planet, however overall, i don't agree with a house limit in general.

I disagree with both of the above posts. This doesn't really apply to me because I don't have multiple houses in one spot, but if you got the money, why can't you own more than one property on a planet? How does this prevent others from also investing in a property on that planet? Maybe something has change since the last time I was active.

I dont think there should be a limit on how someone wants to spend their money if you want to work hard and buy 5 10 15 houses you should be able to!

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:55 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:55 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

22:55 You must stand up first.

22:55 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:55 You stand up.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Planet 102141.
