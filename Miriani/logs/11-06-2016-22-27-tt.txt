Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
}SU^(dny2>=m)xBYr?&d`<R7`G`1D+R@X72\'Of<
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, welcome to Belt of Orion. As you travel to the bubble or one of the
asteroid stations, fly safe, keep an eye on your charge and make sure to have
enough EAOS credits for the tolls. Have a nice day!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its
existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased
destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris
still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.
A beacon marks the site of the failed attempt to hold back an Outsider task
force on its way to Mir at the start of the Outsider War. Nearby space glitters
with the wreckage of starships and other debris.

Salvage Outsider Wrecks

A patrol recently ran into a bunch of Outsider ships near Battle of Mir.
The fighting's done, but the people in R&D think there might be something to
salvage from the wrecks.
Head out there and pick up 90,000 units from the wrecks and we'll see what we've
got.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
ymihEwa.Qkdo$wU"raKE@l$vm&OO!Tl28abZo=cY
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.

The starship is already moving.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

You peer into a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge...
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
You can go out.
Ather Jammoa takes Lily Kaise into his group.
Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail
curled loosely around her.
You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a
landing.
Keegan Wantz asks in an Asuncionite accent, "Do you have a Pincer?"
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "I have two frigates."
Keegan Wantz exclaims in an Asuncionite accent, "Ah!"
The long-range sightseer "Epiphany" touches down smoothly on the ground.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "EAOS frigate, right."

quiet hiss of hydraulics.
Lily Kaise grins.
Ather says to Aisling the Fox in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat
New Phoenecian accent, "Ditch the catbot."
Aisling the Fox looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.
Aisling the Fox asks in an unusual Irish accent, "Why?"
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Well OK fine. It has no weapons."
Ather Jammoa takes Aisling the Fox into his group.
The long-range sightseer "Epiphany" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and

Aisling the Fox asks in an unusual Irish accent, "Then how can you partake?"
Ather Jammoa takes Damien Alexander into his group.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Ather says to Aisling, "I am a superiorly evolved creature, not a robot."
Lily Kaise gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
The three-person phantazein "Tetzahuitl" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and
slowly moved into a large garage.
You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a

you enter the cloud, or turning?"

grin lily
You grin at Lily Kaise.
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I generally get about 2.93."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I literally scoop up the
whole cloud. So like, when I enter the cloud, I wait maybe, seven, or eight
seconds, pop open the valve, then I turn. It's how I was taught by someone, ages
ago. It gives me much good gas."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Hmm, I always found turning
lowers the triddium rate."
kiss lily on nipple
You kiss Lily Kaise on one nipple.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I found that, too, but it

through the cloud until it dicipates."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah don't turn while in the
cloud. But be certain to close the intake prior to exiting the cloud and don't
turn until you exit."
[General Communication] "Sounds like most other things, everybody's got their
way." Nicolette Lawrence laughs. "But I'm going to try that approach and see if
it helps."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Wow wonder who told her that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Try all the ways."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I don't think any way is
right, or wrong."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Yep, it's whatever is most
tolerable."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, a robotic

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
A small space station is here, an aged hunk of metal in space, with bright
lights mounted to show that it's still operational. A basic friend-or-foe ident
signal is all that advertises it to be Chet's Grill and Space Sports Bar.
Occasionally, the station expels a jet of particles as the kitchen empties its
fryers of grease.

About ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, this section
of smoothly finished gray corridor curves slightly as part of the outer ring of
the station, commonly called the Outring. Polished metal girders protrude from
the walls, which arch gradually to meet overhead. Though the light here is never
bright, the tall glowing panels recessed into the walls provide a steady
illumination. On the east side of this area is a wide, open hatch leading into a
spacious corridor extending toward the center of the station. Smaller hatches
follow the outring around the station to the north and south, and the sounds of
ships landing and launching often comes from the corridor leading west from
here. In one corner of the intersection, a narrow circular set of stairs leads
down to a lower level.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

each set into a shallow alcove with a keypad beside it. In the dim but steady
light, you can see a metal plaque on one of the doorways, reading, 'Damage
Control.' Visitors wandering into this area usually get a stern look from
station personnel passing by, while familiar faces get a nod of recognition. It
is quiet here, footsteps muffled by the thin dark gray carpet.

semicircular wheel-like brace overhead where the girders meet. The light is dim
but steady, provided by tall glowing panels that match the curvature of the
walls. Along the corridor are several doorways set into shallow alcoves, one
identified as 'Trade Licensing and Certification,' though entrance into that
area requires a code unlikely to be known by civilian pilots.

is a laminated notice of the corridor being closed for maintenance in what might
be the near future.

doorway reads: 'Electronics Fabrication.' Beside it are instructions for general
deliveries to the shop.

brace. Between the girders are alcoves containing doorways marked as various
station offices. One of the doorways here has a metal sign bolted to it,

[Lambda Facility T-K56-3; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is home to dozens of the large, fairly haphazard Lambda
transport ships. Several dozen wild-eyed men and women continually move large
pallets and hoverbouts back and forth, occasionally filling the transports, but
rarely just moving an empty pallet back and forth in the same area for several
minutes. A wide elevator is apparently used to move containers and supplies to
and from the storage area. An open hatchway to the north reveals an unlit
corridor.

Leading away from the docking bay, this unlit corridor terminates in a locked

portal to the west is locked and sealed, however.

contemplation. Or a bar, one of the two. Religious symbols that your
subconscious half-recognises cover the walls, along with fragments of text that
seems familiar, yet cannot be placed. Near the wall opposite the doorway is a
raised dais. Candles rest at each corner of the room, polluting the air with
their smoke, while incense burners are hung on either side of the room,
increasing the work for the air filtration system even more. A sigil has been

The storage floor is aptly named, giving a reason for the surprisingly large
size of a station with so few services. Taking probably three quarters of the
station up and almost half a mile long, the floor is divided into subfloors and
sections, each area apparently designated for a specific type of supply or
material. The largest subfloor seems to contain large medical drums, though you
can also see starship parts and even plasteel plating in other sections. A wide
elevator is apparently used to move containers and supplies to and from the
docking bay.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Lambda Facility T-K56-3; Docking Bay.

their smoke, while incense burners are hung on either side of the room,
