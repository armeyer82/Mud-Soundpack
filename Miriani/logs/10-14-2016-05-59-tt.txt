Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown

service robot, a cardboard box labeled 'Here be keys', an orange plastic box

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy
poster of Nouveau Quebec Premier Maxime Roberge giving two thumbs up, a small
cinnamon brown trash bin, a large bubbling royal blue-lit aquarium containing
white round rocks, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a
side table dressed with a fancy white cloth decorated with gold fleur-de-lis, a
black plastic tray of spider chow, a glossy dark violet ceramic felo chow bowl,
a soft square brown floor cushion, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
