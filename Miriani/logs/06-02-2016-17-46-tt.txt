-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.

Currently 13.25 LTC out of the Radio Bubble on course 45.0 15.0
The riftflow has been turning through our course again. Present flow rate of
6000 lmc/sc from Northeast and Up.
On top of that, the rift drive began making weird noises. I dropped us out of
the rift for repairs. As soon as repairs were complete we were under way again
at 1JIJI.J0G [1609 GST]. Prior to repairs our speed had been 1620 lmc/sc. After
repairs we were making 2000 lmc/sc.

The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on

Sakura says to Kim, "No harm in imaging it and finding out though is there?"
Kim gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "It would take us, hmm,
roughly guessing which I am not good at, 30 minutes at least."
"So a total of an hour out of our way?" Morris asks. "I'm not opposed, if that
makes a difference."
Sakura says to Morris, "Not an hour. Maybe half that."
Kim asks, "Any opinions from our expedition experts?"
Morris says to Sakura, "If it's half an our off course, then to get on course
from there would be another half hour...right? Or am I oversimplifying it?"
"Well these probably won't pay as much as those farther out," Lily says. "It's
up to you all though."

interesting looking."

east, also known as coreward. 90 is north, also known as spinward, 180 is west,
rimward, and 270 is south, anti-spinward."
"It's a spherical coordinate," says Akemi. "The first part is a compass heading,
and the second part is how high or low you are aimed along that heading."
Kim says, "I meant, 0 is east."
Akemi nods to Kim.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades

Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,

"The trick is keep an eye on your location and if it changes, then adjust your
course," Sakura says.
Kim says to Simon in a New Bristol accent, "As for the second part, 0 is neither
up nor down. Then anything between 0 and uh, I think 23 is very slightly up,
then you get slightly up, up, and in the end you are either mostly going up and
slightly in another direction and 90 is straight up. I can never remember the
exact figures. For the down it becomes -1 through -90 and it works basicly the
same."
Kim says to Akemi in a New Bristol accent, "Want me to write on the board about

"Oh you're welcome," says Zandria.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
Zandria Marschaund says, OOCly, "The most embarrassing thing about that was that
I was going to add love at the end of that. Considering that fuckup, I'm glad I
didn't just because...well...anyway..."
Kim nods to Sakura. "Looks good so far."

Lily chuckles.
"Long range scans only pick up other ship signatures," Sakura says. "Not planets
or anything."
Lily nods.
Zandria says, "Oh..."
"Or station sigs," says Sakura.
Zandria says, "Oops..."
Zandria says, "Good think to know."
Sakura says to Zandria, "All good you didn't know."
Kim smiles. "Well, we're here to learn."
Michael nods.
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Use rift loc to see what the sensors have detected."
"Passive sensors aren't all that great at picking up stuff either," Akemi says.
"You need to be fairly close, even for something being noisy."
Lily nods.
Morris Corlew opens a new black leather-bound book with the title embossed in
silver and the pages edged in silver gilt.
Sakura Arakida says, OOCly, "Rift l I use to see what we've found. As well as

Kim says to Sakura, "That's always nice."
Sakura says to Zandria, "The trick is keep an eye on your rift location to make
sure you don't need to adjust, if you do, then check your rift status to make
sure your direction and the direction of the thing you're going to match."
"Ah okay," says Zandria.
Zandria grins.
"It's good to keep a close eye on it," says Akemi, "so that you can pick a
direction that's on the boundary between the vague directions the rift sensors
report."
Zandria nods.
"I'm sitting here running over compass directions in my head trying to calculate
exact edges to headings," says Nathaniel, "don't ask me why, but it helps for me
to get a better idea."
Sakura says to Akemi, "That's what I did. Though the flat direction hasn't
changed, just the elevation."
"I'm never very good with the edges," says Kim, "but practice makes it easier."
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

"Faster speeds mean you'll see those changes more often, and pay more for not
being well aimed," Akemi says. "So you struggle for awhile, and then get better
at it."
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all
directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the
depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

redshift or blueshift.
Lily nods.
Simon asks, "What's redshift and blueshift?"
"Dying stars often eat planets," Akemi says.
Lily says, "Swolen stars make me sad too."
Morris asks, "Change in the light spectrum right?"
Morris says, "Just a guess, but..."
The planetary surveyor displays a field of moving waves as it searches for
nearby gravity wells.
"Oh, that describes the doppler effect," Akemi says. "Objects moving toward you
will be more blue, objects moving from you are more red."
Morris says, "Hmm thanks."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
southwest.
The planetary surveyor displays a field of moving waves as it searches for
nearby gravity wells.
"I thought it might have to do with the spectrum stars are emitting," Morris
says.
"So if you have a good idea of what color the object should be already," says
Akemi, "you can use that to measure how fast it is moving away or toward you."
Akemi says, "It does, sort of."
"Not the application I was thinking, though." Morris nods. "I was thinking it
was used to determine age of stars or something because how their spectrum
shifts with age."
The planetary surveyor emits a series of quiet beeps, then continues working.
"If you know what color the star is," says Akemi, "you can use the redshift and
blueshift to identify it with better certainty."
"The color light they emit," Morris says.
Morris says, "Ah, ok."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
The planetary surveyor displays a comparison of spectrum analyses, searching for
redshift or blueshift.
"So if you know it's a yellow dwarf but there's a lot of blue shift," asks
Morris, "is it coming toward you (or rather you toward it)?"
"On the scale the surveyor works at though," says Akemi, "it's looking for
objects that are reflecting light from the primary here and are moving in a
possible orbit."
Morris says, "I've never seen how it's actually reported before."
Morris gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
The planetary surveyor emits a series of quiet beeps, then continues working.
"Well, using it on stars is most useful if you have a starchart that includes
that star," Akemi says. "If you're on one side of it, it will seem to be moving
at you, and on the other it will seem to be moving away."
"But for planets it's just looking for reflected light, basically," Akemi says.
The planetary surveyor displays a handful of moving points of light which could
be planets. Text alongside shows probable composition and mass.
Akemi says, "It's just one of the ways you winnow down all the objects in a
system until you just have a few that are probably planets."

Akemi Bando glances down at her black wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.
Morris frowns. "Ah darn."
"Well," asks Kim, "don't think we need to see debris from other sectors in
here?"
Akemi says, "This is a fairly large nebula."
Lily shakes her head.
Lily says, "This is a pretty good sample of what's here."
"Ok, onward," says Kim.

Kim nods. "I didn't think so."
Kim Saunders quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 45.0, 15.0.
Kim Saunders flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control
board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
"If we were going somewhere and we knew where," says Akemi, "or we were trying
to scout out a position for an observatory, it'd be different."
"There," says Kim, "now to write a board post."
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Kim Saunders navigates her metallic green touch einrophone to a text-heavy
application and peers at the screen.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

majorly important?"
Akemi says, "Looks okay to me."
"Only other thing that might be interesting is the non-directional beacon
strengths, but it's not a big deal for this one," Akemi says. "It's not a place
we're likely to look specifically for."

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, Zorya
the hovering dragonfly robot, an elegant crystal decanter, a small blue
insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a bottle of

We spotted Nebular Signature 6466-9001 and decided to go in for a look. sakura
changed the heading after we had traveled 5.18 LTC from where the drive was
repaired, the nebular was then at approximately 23.15 LGC north northwest and
slightly up.
the luminosity was slightly dim and we saw grade 60 and 70 lumpy rocks and super
heated masses. An image was taken and placed in the box, and we scanned for
planets but found none.
We then continued on our heading of 45 15.
