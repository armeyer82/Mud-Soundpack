00:12 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

00:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:12 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

00:12 You're already sitting down.

00:12 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:12 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:13 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:13 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Empanda Station.

00:13 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:13 The one-person expediter "Emarld Phoenix" has launched from Miriani.

00:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:13 The three-person freighter "Sky Wolf" has landed on the planet Miriani.

00:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:13 You should stand up first.

00:13 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

00:13 You should stand up first.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the three-person cruiser "Molnija", the five-person transverser "Stellar Glider", the one-person expediter "Flying Cat", the six-person destroyer "Dark Desires", and the eight-person gunship "Star Sapphire Dragon" landed here.

06:11 Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
06:11 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food
frosting:
    none
    with chocolate frosting
    topped with chocolate whipped cream

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the one-person expediter "Flying Cat" landed here.

A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the one-person expediter "Flying Cat" landed here.

06:50 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, and a metallic silver starship simulator here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here.
You can go south.

13:53 Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
13:53 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food

14:16 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, and a metallic silver starship simulator here.

14:28 [Empanda Station; Robotics Lab] (indoors) (lying on the ground)
This large room is jam-packed with tables full of machinery and crates of spare body parts leftover from some mad scientist's nefarious doings. Harsh white lights cast a blinding glare throughout the area, and the white walls and floor tiles reflect the light, brightening every square inch of the place. Strong-looking metal doors are set in intervals along the walls, and a constant stream of people can be seen coming and going through them. One of the tables has a hologram projector mounted above it, and when activated, images are shown on the table and can be manipulated for quality assurance.

Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
14:38 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food
frosting:
    none
    with chocolate frosting
    topped with chocolate whipped cream

Pale silver light from ornate sconces mounted on the cream-colored walls reflect off the polished marble floor. Set into the gleaming stone is a pattern of mosaic tiles, their varying shades of blue and green combining to form elaborate swirling patterns against the ivory background. A steady stream of traffic flows constantly down the long corridor from the pilots who dart for the security checkpoint or disappear into one of the large archways that branch away from the strip. Mounted above the closest entrance is a sign designating the room beyond as the Empanda pet tracking facility.

19:22 Dear Tibo Beauchene,
We apologize for the inconvenience, but we've found that your tradesman request is not in compliance with the rules set forth by the merchants alliance and/or the tradesman who issued your certificate. A complimentary copy of the rules has been enclosed in this envelope along with a certificate redemption token and the reason for the rejection has been included below. Please feel free to USE this certificate to request another item after you familiarize yourself with the enclosed information.
Reason for Rejection:
First, the item name isn't proper. Special Party Caterer really isn't a proper name for an object. Second, the menu has several capitalization errors. Many words are capitalized when they shouldn't be, and names of items have mixed capitalization that makes no sense. Please proofread your menu and resubmit the item.
Sincerely,
Merchant Frank Foil

* Once a tradesman item is complete, it cannot be added to unless you use another month's tradesman item. For example: You got a baby and you saw that your friend's baby can throw feces at people. So you assist and ask if your baby can do this too. No, it can't. You will have to wait for your next tradesman item and request that ability the next time around. Another example: You want to add toast to your food bot. Sorry, not going to happen. Compile a small list of foods to add on your next tradesman request or live without toast.
* Food dispensing things are limited to 20 items per tradesman request.
* Space stations come with some basic functionalities, such as flight control, security systems, and one or two food stores, but that's it. Any additional special functionality will have to be a tradesman request.
* Houses are likewise limited. You get the house wherever you want it, security systems, and a private garage. Any special items or abilities beyond that will have to be through a tradesman.
* One custom verb per item per month. One item per month. A verb is defined as a special action that the object can perform. If you want a lamp, for example, turning it on and off would count as the verb. Some items come with several verbs already defined, such as pets and babies.
* Tradesman items cannot stun or otherwise incapacitate another player.
* It is fully up to a tradesman to create a way to "defend" against a tradesman item that you receive. For example, room scanning eye patches may be pulseable, towels will wipe off whipped cream or water, etc. If we see a need to balance something or protect players in some way, it may be added. Getting angry won't change a thing.
* Tradesman may also refuse any request for any reason. This can be a balance reason, a work reason, a conflict of interest, or anything else. If your item is refused, you will receive a letter in the mail.
* Since tradesmen are in character entities, you will no longer receive tradesman requests out of communications range. You will also no longer receive any kind of tradesman correspondence when out of comms. It is recommended that you finish any kind of tradesman interaction BEFORE taking long trips out. (Yes, this is one of the disadvantages to going out of comms.)
* Tradesman items can be revoked after the fact should they prove to be a danger to gameplay in any way. If this occurs, you will be able to request a new item.
* As tradesman items are considered to be in character, we will not replace lost modifications to items should those items be lost to legitimate in-character activities. For example: If you have rooms renamed in your ship and then you lose your ship, those modifications are lost, much as they would be if you hired somebody to paint a mural in your bedroom and your house burned down.
* If you request an item that is copying another person's item (e.g. you want a copy of somebody's vanity), that counts as a single request. You will NOT be able to add additional options on top of that. (See board post 77469)
* Items that modify walking style should follow these guidelines:
    - Single words. (e.g. runs, sprints, meanders)
    - No flying, levitating, or hovering. (You would hurt yourself!)
    - Styles should make sense in the context of shoes. (e.g. ice skates probably won't roll you around on tank treads)
*  Pulse emitters and stun guns must have pulse or stun in the name somewhere.
* Unless it makes sense for your item to perform some sort of action constantly, don't include actions in its description. A dog isn't always going to be sniffing around or wagging his tail, nor is a baby always going to be smiling or kicking her legs and  waving her arms. Avoid using adjectives in the description, such as cute or adorable

You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a translucent architectural design simulator, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, a red-haired female nanny bot, an orange and white cat, and a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You see Kitty Mars (sitting on a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

23:30 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.
