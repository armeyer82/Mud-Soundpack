The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2486 light-minutes per second from Galactic West and

Many hellos,
I am posting this as a notice of increased Omega Pirate Cartel activity in
Mutuality space, specifically in Tandem area and Gateway. These are ships not
flying under Tandem Pact transponder, and you may even notice Tandem Pact Omega
ships respond to these and engage.
If you do see this happen, be mindful not to fire upon Tandem Pact vessels. Also
be mindful that Omega ships are not equipped with escape pods. If you have no
choice but to engage, that is one thing, but remember you may be taking a life
in doing so.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple
and amethyst flower quilt, and a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket on it, a large
oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a pair of tan suede clogs, a pair of gray
canvas sneakers, and a large periwinkle bed pillow here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
