When debris is getting too big for your storage room, you have a few options. You can either destroy it by shooting it, make room by expelling something, leave it be and try salvaging something else, or transfer it somewhere. Due to how debris is implemented, making it able to be split into smaller pieces isn't really easy to do.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
