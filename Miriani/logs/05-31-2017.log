-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic lif

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Star Conquest Help: Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying
--
Category: Activities
--
This help file describes various scientific tasks you can perform on points of interest you find in deep space. Points of interest can be nearly anything -- asteroid clusters, nebulas, star systems, and more! You will find these objects at intervals when exploring in deep space, and your first step is to simply approach them and have your ship arrive within the area of interest. After that, there are several things you can do, depending on your ship's equipment, to study the object. The data you bring back home is likely to be very valuable!

IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, AND ANALYZING

Space imaging is described in detail in the Space Imaging help file.

Once your starship has space imaging equipment, it can be augmented with a series of spectroscopes and scanners sold by Central Stellar Cartography at the main location on The Torus. The command to begin using this equipment is SPECTROSCOPE. Once started, the computer will iterate through all of the analysis equipment it has available. If you wish, the scan can be aborted by repeating the command. The data gathered will be stored in the ship's surveying databanks -- more on this below!

PLANETARY SURVEYING

Certain points of interests will be planetary systems! Exoplanets are of particular interest to scientists back home and are always an exciting find.

The first step, if your ship has the necessary planetary surveyor, is to use the SURVEY command. This will begin a series of scans that will eventually locate and plot the orbits of all planets in the system.

Once the planets are found, you can use the JUMP command to have your ship perform a field triangulation and travel via wormhole to your newly discovered planets! However, this is where your advancement of scientific understanding ends... unless, of course, you also have probes aboard, as detailed in the next section!

PROBES AND LANDERS

If you have enough points, you may purchase a probe launcher from Central Stellar Cartography. It can then be loaded with probes at any CSC branch using the usual MENU and BUY commands. If you find you have too many of a particular type of probe, you can unload them for some of your money back using the SELL command.

Probes are used to study points of interest as well as individual planets. Each probe can be deployed using one of three programs: close approach, extended observation, or lander. A close approach probe is simply fired directly at an object and transmits telemetry for as long as it can, often right up until it impacts. An extended observation probe orbits or holds station near an object for at least several hours, gathering much more information. And a lander will gather information about the surface of a planet.

You do not need to stay and wait for a probe to complete a lengthy observation. If you return to the site at any time after a probe has completed its program, it will transmit the data to your ship within a minute or so. Since both probes and time are limited, it is a good idea to save them for particularly worthy targets, like green planets or exotic objects.

DISCOVERER CREDIT

Discoverers are the first people to image, survey, scan, or probe a new point of interest and will be accorded a certain special status forever. If you cannot complete all possible tasks at a point of interest, then any future followup work will still be credited to any qualifying discoverers, even if they are not on the new crew.

Uncertain if you're the first one to visit an area, or which studies have already been performed? Be sure to get the CSC's onboard library upgrade and use the LIBRARY command!

DATABANKS

Images are physical hardcopies and planetary surveys are stored in the ship's main databanks, but all other data is stored on special surveying databanks. These databanks have a limited capacity depending on the type of ship, which can be viewed with the DATABANKS command. This capacity can be extended with upgrades.

CREDITS FOR DATA

Surveying data can be transferred to any Central Stellar Cartography branch using the SUBMIT command. Crew members must individually submit their planets, but only the ship's owner can submit the contents of its databanks. Once the data is processed, each member w
01:08:27 ill be mailed their reward and given the appropriate points.

2017 Exploration Revision

We have revised planetary surveying and space imaging and added a new progression of equipment to these activities. The purpose of this is to make the benefits of exploration less frontloaded while adding to the sense that exploration crews are making new discoveries and doing important work.

 - Let's start with the bad news. Planetary surveying and space imaging as you know them are now just preliminary work and will reward you less than before.

 - A range of spectroscopes and other more sci-fi scanners have been added as follow-on work to space imaging. Each type of scan you perform increases the value of the data you will bring home.

 - Planetary surveying now actually generates complete planetary systems.

 - The ship's computer will now let you perform field triangulations to jump your ship into orbit over newly discovered planets.

 - Probes of various types have been added, deployable for close approaches, extended observations, and planetary landings. Probes are additional follow-on work after imaging points of interest, as well as follow-on work to planetary surveying.

 - Existing points of interest have been retroactively flagged as if the new data has already been gathered, since they have already paid out under the old structure. The onboard library upgrade will reflect this.

 - Exploration ships now possess surveying databanks to hold all of this data, whi
01:15:43 ch can be extended with new upgrades.

 - A Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying help file has been added to explain the new activities and equipment.

As with any new addition, expect minor adjustments to occur for a little while until we feel the system is in a balanced state. Future plans for expansion include exploring the surface of new planets!

Recent Minor Changes:

-----
New profiles now require a short character concept to be written first.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 56 minutes, and 19 seconds ago
-----
Cadet point caps have been adjusted. The limit in each category for those without an approved concept is 100. The limit for those with a concept but no profile is 250.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 37 minutes, and 51 seconds ago
-----
Old space features (oort clouds, asteroid clusters, systems, etc.) will now be purged periodically. The purged features are algorithmically determined to be of little relevance, so ideally you won't notice much of a difference. Let us know if you do!

01:17:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:19:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

01:19:58 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Delta.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a large periwinkle bed pillow here.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it.)

01:23:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:23:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:23:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:23:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:23:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:23:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:24:23 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:24:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:24:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:24:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:25:03 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:25:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:32:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:32:31 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:32:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:32:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:32:38 The ship is already moving.

01:32:46 The computer reports that the four-person space constructor "Silent Horizon" has jumped into the sector.

01:32:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:32:48 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:32:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:32:48 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Silent Horizon! Welcome to home space!"

01:35:33 Recent Major Changes:

-----
2017 Exploration Revision

We have revised planetary surveying and space imaging and added a new progression of equipment to these activities. The purpose of this is to make the benefits of exploration less frontloaded while adding to the sense that exploration crews are making new discoveries and doing important work.

 - Let's start with the bad news. Planetary surveying and space imaging as you know them are now just preliminary work and will reward you less than before.

 - A range of spectroscopes and other more sci-fi scanners have been added as follow-on work to space imaging. Each type of scan you perform increases the value of the data you will bring home.

 - Planetary surveying now actually generates complete planetary systems.

 - The ship's computer will now let you perform field triangulations to jump your ship into orbit over newly discovered planets.

 - Probes of various types have been added, deployable for close approaches, extended observations, and planetary landings. Probes are additional follow-on work after imaging points of interest, as well as follow-on work to planetary surveying.

 - Existing points of interest have been retroactively flagged as if the new data has already been gathered, since they have already paid out under the old structure. The onboard library upgrade will reflect this.

 - Exploration ships now possess surveying databanks to hold all of this data, whi
01:35:34 ch can be extended with new upgrades.

 - A Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying help file has been added to explain the new activities and equipment.

As with any new addition, expect minor adjustments to occur for a little while until we feel the system is in a balanced state. Future plans for expansion include exploring the surface of new planets!

Recent Minor Changes:

-----
New profiles now require a short character concept to be written first.
   Posted 6 days, 4 hours, 16 minutes, and 8 seconds ago
-----
Cadet point caps have been adjusted. The limit in each category for those without an approved concept is 100. The limit for those with a concept but no profile is 250.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 57 minutes, and 40 seconds ago

Old space features (oort clouds, asteroid clusters, systems, etc.) will now be purged periodically. The purged features are algorithmically determined to be of little relevance, so ideally you won't notice much of a difference. Let us know if you do!

Star Conquest Help: Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying
--
Category: Activities
--
This help file describes various scientific tasks you can perform on points of interest you find in deep space. Points of interest can be nearly anything -- asteroid clusters, nebulas, star systems, and more! You will find these objects at intervals when exploring in deep space, and your first step is to simply approach them and have your ship arrive within the area of interest. After that, there are several things you can do, depending on your ship's equipment, to study the object. The data you bring back home is likely to be very valuable!

IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, AND ANALYZING

Space imaging is described in detail in the Space Imaging help file.

Once your starship has space imaging equipment, it can be augmented with a series of spectroscopes and scanners sold by Central Stellar Cartography at the main location on The Torus. The command to begin using this equipment is SPECTROSCOPE. Once started, the computer will iterate through all of the analysis equipment it has available. If you wish, the scan can be aborted by repeating the command. The data gathered will be stored in the ship's surveying databanks -- more on this below!

PLANETARY SURVEYING

Certain points of interests will be planetary systems! Exoplanets are of particular interest to scientists back home and are always an exciting find.

The first step, if your ship has the necessary planetary surveyor, is to use the SURVEY command. This will begin a series of scans that will eventually locate and plot the orbits of all planets in the system.

Once the planets are found, you can use the JUMP command to have your ship perform a field triangulation and travel via wormhole to your newly discovered planets! However, this is where your advancement of scientific understanding ends... unless, of course, you also have probes aboard, as detailed in the next section!

PROBES AND LANDERS

If you have enough points, you may purchase a probe launcher from Central Stellar Cartography. It can then be loaded with probes at any CSC branch using the usual MENU and BUY commands. If you find you have too many of a particular type of probe, you can unload them for some of your money back using the SELL command.

Probes are used to study points of interest as well as individual planets. Each probe can be deployed using one of three programs: close approach, extended observation, or lander. A close approach probe is simply fired directly at an object and transmits telemetry for as long as it can, often right up until it impacts. An extended observation probe orbits or holds station near an object for at least several hours, gathering much more information. And a lander will gather information about the surface of a planet.

You do not need to stay and wait for a probe to complete a lengthy observ
01:36:25 ation. If you return to the site at any time after a probe has completed its program, it will transmit the data to your ship within a minute or so. Since both probes and time are limited, it is a good idea to save them for particularly worthy targets, like green planets or exotic objects.

DISCOVERER CREDIT

Discoverers are the first people to image, survey, scan, or probe a new point of interest and will be accorded a certain special status forever. If you cannot complete all possible tasks at a point of interest, then any future followup work will still be credited to any qualifying discoverers, even if they are not on the new crew.

Uncertain if you're the first one to visit an area, or which studies have already been performed? Be sure to get the CSC's onboard library upgrade and use the LIBRARY command!

DATABANKS

Images are physical hardcopies and planetary surveys are stored in the ship's main databanks, but all other data is stored on special surveying databanks. These databanks have a limited capacity depending on the type of ship, which can be viewed with the DATABANKS command. This capacity can be extended with upgrades.

CREDITS FOR DATA

Surveying data can be transferred to any Central Stellar Cartography branch using the SUBMIT command. Crew members must individually submit their planets, but only the ship's owner can submit the contents of its databanks. Once the data is processed, each member w
01:36:25 ill be mailed their reward and given the appropriate points.

On either side of the corridor is a row of tall windows that provides on one side a glimpse of the inner curve of the opposite side of the Torus and, on the other, the sight of the starry black space beyond the station. Between two windows on the outer side of the corridor is a slim doorway marked 'Xenology Center.'

You can go south, up, and out.

01:39:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:39:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:39:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:39:51 The ship is already moving.

01:39:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:39:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:39:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:39:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:39:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:39:59 I can't find "chair."

01:40:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:40:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:40:02 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:40:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:40:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:40:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:40:07 The stellar cartography library will only work in space.

01:40:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:40:09 This is a sector within a FTL beacon network.

01:40:10 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Justen Moon! Welcome to home space!"

01:40:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

01:40:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:40:21 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Icarus" has jumped out of the sector.

01:40:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:40:55 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:41:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:41:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:41:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:41:10 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:14:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:14:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:14:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:14:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:14:33 The ship is already moving.

02:14:35 The ship is already moving.

02:14:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:14:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:14:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:14:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

02:14:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:14:41 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

02:14:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

02:15:12 Board what?

02:15:15 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

02:15:15 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Elaina Destri and Reed Bohrds are sleeping on a cushy booth seat.
Joel Kringle is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.

02:15:15  You are wearing a blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a red cotton pajama top and a pair of red cotton pajama bottoms. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

02:15:15 You are carrying nothing.

02:15:17 Joel Kringle stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

02:15:21 You wave.

02:15:24 Joel Kringle waves.

02:15:24 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

02:15:24 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Elaina Destri and Reed Bohrds are sleeping on a cushy booth seat.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go out.

02:15:26 Joel Kringle says, "Word up bruh."

02:15:29 Joel Kringle grins.

02:15:39 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:15:41 You grin.

02:15:43 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person Accord gemini "Galactic Tornado".

02:16:05 Nathaniel Owens just arrived.

02:16:17 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Cool."

02:16:23 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Come to earth."

02:16:26 You say to Nathaniel Owens, "We can go undercrewed or someone can drop out."

02:16:38 Joel Kringle says, "Either option I'm good with."

02:16:38 You ask, "Unless you got a fifth?"

02:16:42 Nathaniel Owens says, "We can do under crewed. So long as we have an eng we'll be fine."

02:16:45 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the one-person cargo hauler "Dandelion" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

02:16:48 You nod.

02:17:00 You say, "I can engineer."

02:17:05 Joel Kringle gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:17:05 Nathaniel says to you, "Thanks."

02:17:09 Joel Kringle says, "That works."

02:17:16 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Fuck."

02:17:20 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Dandelion".

02:17:26 A well-dressed man speaks in hushed tones to a nearby pilot and hands him a small credit chip.

02:17:26 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:17:29 You say, "Ummm, not here. I'd rather not."

02:17:33 Joel Kringle chuckles.

02:17:34 Nathaniel Owens removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a black flightbag.

02:17:38 Joel Kringle snickers.

02:17:38 Angela Caesar just arrived.

02:17:41 Joel Kringle says, "That's rich."

02:17:41 Nathaniel Owens says, "Say again? Sorry space suit."

02:17:41 Angela Caesar waves.

02:17:43 You wave to Angela Caesar.

02:17:52 Angela Caesar steps up to a brightly-lit candy vending machine.

02:17:53 Joel Kringle waves.

02:17:54 Angela Caesar carefully presses a button on a brightly-lit candy vending machine and receives a Caramel Fusion Bar.

02:17:55 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "We could just burn through some."

02:18:01 Angela Caesar steps up to a brightly-lit candy vending machine.

02:18:04 Angela Caesar carefully presses a button on a brightly-lit candy vending machine and receives a Caramel Fusion Bar.

02:18:16 Angela Caesar puts a Caramel Fusion Bar in a white vinyl duffel bag.

02:18:18 Angela Caesar steps up to a brightly-lit candy vending machine.

02:18:20 A brightly-lit candy vending machine buzzes alarmingly at Angela Caesar and emits a shower of sparks.

02:18:25 Nathaniel Owens speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

02:18:25 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "One more, one more."

02:18:26 Angela Caesar steps up to a brightly-lit candy vending machine.

02:18:28 Angela Caesar taps a button on a brightly-lit candy vending machine and receives a Caramel Fusion Bar.

02:18:33 Nathaniel Owens says, "See if we can't get one more."

02:18:38 You nod.

02:18:40 Angela Caesar says, "That should last awhile."

02:18:43 Angela Caesar grins.

02:18:44 Joel Kringle grins.

02:18:47 I don't see that here.

02:18:49 Angela Caesar puts a Caramel Fusion Bar in a white vinyl duffel bag.

02:18:49 You grin at Angela Caesar.

02:18:59 Angela Caesar says, "I am addicted to these."

02:19:01 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I can do it real quick if you want."

02:19:01 Angela Caesar laughs.

02:19:05 Angela Caesar tears the end off a wrapper of a Caramel Fusion Bar.

02:19:05 You grin.

02:19:11 Joel Kringle grins.

02:19:15 Angela Caesar bites off the end of a Caramel Fusion Bar and chews slowly.

02:19:26 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

02:19:28 Angela Caesar

02:19:28 She appears to be 20 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is of average build with slightly curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has slender shoulders and average-sized breasts. Her face is long and girlish, with a wide nose and round chin. Her lips are faintly downturned and pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are blue and wide. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is dark blonde and drawn back in a ponytail. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a slender golden crown decorated with beautiful sparkling jewels, a soft amethyst velvet top with a ruffled collar and short puffed sleeves trimmed with shimmering gold braid, a silky fringed amethyst sash embroidered with white roses, a pair of soft white velvet pants with a gold harlequin print on the right leg, and a pair of amethyst heels decorated with swirls of sparkling gold glitter. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a charred metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, a plain flat einrophone in a dark gray leather phone holster, an indigo guitar case, a black flightbag, a white vinyl duffel bag, and a compact metallic blue camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery blue camera strap. Her face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and
02:19:28  both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a Caramel Fusion Bar in her left hand.

02:19:32 Angela Caesar takes a larger bite of a Caramel Fusion Bar. A strand of caramel briefly dangles and then attaches itself stickily to her chin.

02:19:35 Joel Kringle says, "Nom."

02:19:38 Joel Kringle smiles.

02:19:41 Angela Caesar nods.

02:19:56 Nathaniel Owens says, "Um, would one of you mind if we borrowed your gunship? Slight issues have came up."

02:20:03 Joel Kringle says, "Sure."

02:20:08 Joel Kringle holds your hand, taking you into his group.

02:20:10 Angela Caesar says, "If SSN sold a case of these I would buy."

02:20:10 Joel Kringle holds Nathaniel Owens's hand, taking him into his group.

02:20:14 Joel Kringle holds Angela Caesar's hand, taking her into his group.

02:20:17 Joel Kringle gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:20:22 You follow Joel Kringle out.

02:20:22 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The five-person strike gunboat "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin and a sanitation drone here.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

02:20:24 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "We're just gonna use joel's. I can rent it and do it I think."

02:20:26 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods northwest.

02:20:33 Angela Caesar chews thoughtfully at the chocolate and caramel concoction in her mouth, then swallows.

02:20:44 You smile at Angela Caesar.

02:20:47 The reactionless drive of the five-person strike gunboat "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

02:20:49 Angela Caesar smiles.

02:20:53 Angela Caesar pops the last bite of a Caramel Fusion Bar into her mouth, then she spends a moment trying to pick sticky caramel from her chin.

02:20:54 The five-person hammerhead "Love Hate Tragedy" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

02:20:54 You follow Joel Kringle aboard the five-person hammerhead "Love Hate Tragedy".
[Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Airlock]
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:20:55 You follow Joel Kringle into the ship.

02:20:56 [Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Control Room]
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a large leather couch, a dark purple leather captain's chair, and a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior here.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:20:57 Joel Kringle disbands his group.

02:20:59 [Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Corridor]

02:20:59 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Business Cats" here.

You can go north and south.

02:21:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:21:06 [Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Engineering Room]

02:21:06 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior, a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

02:21:10 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

02:21:15 Joel Kringle strides in from the north.

02:21:15 You sit down on a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior.

02:21:22 Joel Kringle says, "You're good. Just checking."

02:21:28 You grin.

02:21:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:21:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:21:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:21:45 Joel Kringle strides north.

02:21:46 Joel Kringle strides in from the north.

02:21:47 Joel Kringle strides south.

02:21:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:21:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:21:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:35:47 [Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Engineering Room]

03:35:47 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior, a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go north and south.
(You are sitting on a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior.)

03:37:22 You say, "That's just me."

03:37:24 You grin.

03:37:26 Joel Kringle says, "I sure am."

03:37:31 Joel Kringle says, "I just don't want them to roll out."

03:37:34 You nod.

03:37:37 You say, "Makes sense."

[Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

04:14:39 This large docking bay appears to have been deliberately overbuilt. Fortified by several layers of heavily shielded metal plating integrated into the design and by blast doors and emergency shutdown mechanisms around the airlocks and entrances to other areas, the station seems to have been constructed with defense in mind. Security cameras monitor the bay, though the mechanics in navy blue coveralls who maintain the starships docked here ignore them.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior, a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

04:17:23 [Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Control Room]

04:17:23 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a large leather couch, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl interior, and an airlock chime here.
Jason Rat is hovering on a sleek red and white striped hoverboard.
You can go south and out.

04:17:24 [Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Airlock]

04:17:24 You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:17:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:17:31 You exit the ship.

04:17:31 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The five-person hammerhead "Love Hate Tragedy" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic lif

We have quite a few newer pilots and cadets joining the corps, and it has been some time since we all sat down. This is a good time to talk about common goals and interests for the corps, and anything else we might like to discuss. So, if the date or time does not suit you, drop me a note. For the rest I wish you all a lovely day, fly safe. [17:33 31 May 2317 GST]

23:11:11 Hey Love,
I have the awesomest! news for you. I had heard some little hints about an expedition coming up and then Nissi invited Eli over the General channel yesterday morning I think it was. I didn't say anything there but I wrote her a letter and asked if she had room for us. It was just a humble little query as i did feel a little awkward about inviting us. Still, perhaps others didn't know that we would be interested.
The news is great! Nissi said there is room for us and we will be leaving at midnight on monday. So be ready if I need to take you with me. We will be gone for two weeks and I know if nissi planned this, it's going to be truly amazing!
We'll leave pets except for the lizie and guess we could take Higgins but I'll just put enough food down for him. I probably will load up the fish on a hover pallet and we just feed them every day if there's no room to put the tanks down. Generally though, we can put them in the docking bay so that a robot can feed them.
I love you,
Lily
