Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. You see a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset and a twinkling strand of blue lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a jelly-filled yellow beanbag chair, and a glittery lavender purple star-patterned gold armchair here.

00:18 ["Magical Melody" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a soft royal purple velvet combat chair, an internal stun turret, and a jelly-filled blue beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest.

00:19 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

00:19 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:19 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

00:19 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

00:19 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

00:19 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:19 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:19 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:19 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:19 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:19 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:19 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:19 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:19 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

01:03 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:03 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:03 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

01:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:03 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:03 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:03 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:03 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:03 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:03 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:03 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:03 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

01:03 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:03 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:03 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:03 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:03 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:04 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:04 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

01:04 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

01:04 You stand up.

["Imminent Demise" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a long metal pole holding a gas-fueled stained glass lantern in the shape of a knight's sword, and an antique rich red leather king's throne with a tiny golden phoenix perched on the back here.
You see Brianna West here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

If you don't know if you can fly a particular mission, set it up using my drone settings, then, instead of fighting the ships, just see if you can fly in range of a chosen target for the first five minutes. If your ship is still alive, you most likely have the skill to fly that mission"

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

14:50 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

14:50 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:50 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

14:50 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:50 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:50 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:50 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:50 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:50 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:50 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

14:50 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

14:51 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:51 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

14:51 You have 1,218,927,188.31 credits.

14:51 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Cheetah" has jumped into the sector.

14:51 You remove a droid remote titled "rolukssica" from a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

14:51 You put a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in a black leather briefcase.

14:52 You remove a droid remote titled "acrylon" from a black leather briefcase.

14:52 You gently slide a droid remote titled "acrylon" into a slot on the side of a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. With a soft click, the remote snaps into place and the screen is filled with a live broadcast of Observation Center.

14:52 You're already watching that.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

19:54 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.

21:53 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, and a shiny white starship simulator here.

22:24 You peer out and see...

22:24 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the five-person transverser "Iridescent Dragon" landed here.
You see a sparking airlock, Yawn the droid, Mer the droid, Ozil the droid, and Lose the droid here.
You can go down.

22:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

22:24 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:24 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:24 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:24 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Woo I need one more now. Mikey's leaving me."

22:24 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:24 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Either that or we can do friggits."

22:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:24 You remove a droid remote titled "rolukssica" from a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

22:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:25 [General Communication] Amy Draksen transmits, "Frig it all."

22:25 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:25 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:25 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:25 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

22:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:25 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

22:25 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:25 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:25 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

22:25 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:25 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:25 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:25 The ship is already moving.

22:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

22:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

22:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

22:25 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:25 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

22:26 [General Communication] Amy Draksen transmits, "Alpha."

22:26 You must stand up first.

22:26 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:29 You peer north and see...

22:29 ["Your Sweetest Downfall" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

22:47 ["Your Sweetest Downfall" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
