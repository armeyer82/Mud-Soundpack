11:57 Katrianne Beauchene
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a pale yellow triangular flower blossom in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.

The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a tight-fitting floral beaded halter top with dragonflies embroidered along the bottom over a misty rose lace underwire bra. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of sun-bleached white denim skinny jeans with butterfly shaped purple sapphires on the back pockets over a pair of misty rose lace bikini underwear. She is wearing a pair of white platform sandals on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysts, a long nec

11:57 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

11:57 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

11:57 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

11:57 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

11:57 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

11:57 The ship is already moving.

11:57 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

11:57 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

11:57 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

11:57 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

11:57 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

11:57 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

11:57 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

11:57 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

11:57 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

11:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

11:57 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

11:57 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

11:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

11:57 There are no ships here.

11:58 The one-person expediter "Flying Cat" is located at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

11:58 You indicate to your group members that you no longer wish for them to follow you.

11:58 You peer out and see...

11:58 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Fearless" powered down here.
You see the eight-person gunship "Fire Bandito" landed here.
You see Dee the droid, Tausha the droid, Yowl the droid, Boomer the droid, Scrappy the droid, Karalyn the droid, Calyssa the droid, Cletus the droid, Sameer the droid, Jessicapops the droid, Delta the droid, Chander the droid, and Dixy the droid here.

11:58 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

14:47 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

14:48 Erik Yobi indicates that he no longer wishes you to follow him.

14:48 You notice Erik Yobi using the radio to request launch clearance.

14:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hexanity, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:48 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:48 You wave.

14:48 [General Communication] Erik Yobi transmits, "Last call, one spot for mods!"

14:48 Erik Yobi deftly enters a security code on a pearl gray reconnaissance kit and slides a droid remote titled "HGC Delta" into an inside pocket.

14:48 ["Hexanity" Engineering Room] (indoors)
You see a comfy bright yellow velvet engineer's chair, a cozy baby scarlet silk sofa with lace pillows scattered over it, a soft lavender fluffy divan accented by plump pillows, an enormous turquoise beanbag chair, a glossy green starship simulator, a polished white marble entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a light blue skeeball machine, a shiny white air hockey table, a tall tinkling ice white marble fountain with water pouring down its sides into the bottom, a large granite fireplace with a limestone hearth and a glass mantel, a silver steel storage box, a lime green refrigerator, a green trash bin, a radiant orange tree, a banana plant, a raspberry bush, a strawberry bush, a blueberry bush, a blackberry bush, a watermelon vine, a purple grape vine, an aloe plant, a berry-scented air freshener, a sparkly stun target, an internal stun turret, a misty green woven rug, and Shayla the droid here.
You see Moiraine Yobi (sitting on a comfy bright yellow velvet engineer's chair) and Anara Webster here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

14:49 ["Hexanity" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

You can go northwest.

14:49 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:49 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

14:49 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

14:49 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

14:49 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:49 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:49 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:49 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:49 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:49 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:49 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

14:49 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:49 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:49 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage.

16:34 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

16:34 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:34 Nicholas Prescott's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "with ya there"

16:34 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:34 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:34 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:34 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:34 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

16:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:34 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."
