The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Aquatimis; Landing Pad.

04:50 ["Intergalactic Battle Taxi" Weapons Room 8] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex.
You can go east.

04:51 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

04:51 Jack West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ready or not here we go"

04:51 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

You can go down and out.

14:00 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:00 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

14:00 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

14:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sacrifice, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:00 There are no ships here.

14:00 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:00 A small voice says, "Please prepare for evacuation. You have 60 seconds to ABORT the escape sequence."

14:00 You abort the escape pod launch.

14:00 The computer announces, "Escape pod launch canceled."

14:00 A loud klaxon sounds as blue lights flash overhead.

14:00 The computer announces, "Self-destruct sequence initiated. Destruction in sixty seconds."

14:01 You hear several rumbling sounds as the starship explodes around you.
The computer announces, "Crisis alert! Starship destruction imminent. Beginning emergency evacuation of all personnel."
You are suddenly seized by a powerful EM field and deposited into an escape pod.
Your torso has been injured!

You see nowhere obvious to go.
The pod rocks gently as it rapidly breaks free from the starship's hull.

14:02 The experimental wormhole drive suddenly kicks to life, creating a high-pitched mechanical whine that fills the enclosed space.

14:02 You have a gaping wound on your torso.

14:02 Your head, left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg are uninjured.

14:02 The pod vibrates violently as it approaches the wormhole mouth.

14:02 The sound of strained components echos throughout the pod. It sounds as if it's going to break apart altogether.

14:02 With one final burst of acceleration, the pod emerges from the wormhole and begins accelerating through space under the power of the relativity drive.

14:03 #$#soundpack_pong

14:03 #$#soundpack_lag 104

14:03 You feel mild acceleration as the pod descends.

14:03 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

14:03 With a final jolt, the pod completes its landing. As you depart, you notice an army of automated drones arrive to clear the spent pod away.

14:55 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:55 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

14:55 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:55 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:55 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:55 Taleila Castle's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Thanks all!"

14:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:55 Taleila Castle's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Have a great new year!"

14:55 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the three-person cruiser "Saving Innocence", the one-person cargo hauler "Titanic", and the one-person cargo hauler "Haram Khor" powered down here.

21:25 Invalid selection.

21:25 Command help: CONDENSE - This will condense certain destinations on autopilot and, if desired, on the starmap. This means that if there are 50 pieces of debris in the sector, autopilot will only show the nearest piece rather than the entire list.

21:25 That matches multiple help files. Please be more specific: 
[1] Secondary Topic: Condense Debris Coordinates in Weapon Readout on Starmap

21:25 --------------------------------------------------

21:25 Condense Debris Coordinates in Weapon Readout on Starmap
--------------------------------------------------
When enabled, the coordinate rundown of the starmap will only show the coordinates for a single piece of debris, similar to how the MOVE command only shows one piece of debris. If disabled, the coordinate rundown will show the coordinates of every piece of debris in the sector.

21:26 --------------------------------------------------

21:26 Always Display Coordinate Rundown
--------------------------------------------------
Typically, non-weapon rooms in ships will only display a basic starmap. This is beneficial for pilots, for instance, in removing distractions and allowing them to focus exclusively on the starmap. With this option enabled, the coordinate rundown will be displayed on all starmaps regardless of room type.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a silver trash bin tucked discretely in a corner. A red plastic cooler on wheels and a compact turquoise cooler tucked beneath a small white marble side table with elegant gold leafing twining up the legs.

23:49 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:49 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:49 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:49 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:49 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

23:49 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:49 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

23:49 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:49 Moiraine Yobi's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "good luck!"

23:49 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:49 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:49 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:49 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

23:49 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:49 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:49 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

23:49 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.
