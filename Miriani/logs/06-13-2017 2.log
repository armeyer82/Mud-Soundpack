00:00:53 Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. probably about the right time for tension, can't keep this many people cooped up together for so long without a little of that."

00:00:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "Some. Nothing major probably."

00:01:02 Eli Grey nods to Nissi Valdaire.

00:01:11 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

00:01:11 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

00:01:35 Aisling the Fox sniffs and rubs her red eyes slightly, then tries to compose herself.

00:01:50 Aisling the Fox sits down on a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

00:02:18 Eli Grey raises an eyebrow at Aisling the Fox.

00:02:23 Eli says to Aisling, "You alright?"

00:02:28 Aisling the Fox says, "I am fine."

00:03:05 Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. you don't seem fine but.. well maybe I better stay out of whatever this is.."

00:03:09 Eli comforts Aisling.

00:03:17 Morris says to Aisling, "Look...I didn't mean to imply you didn't understand or minimize your situation...and I'm sorry. I wasn't tryin to hurt you. I do understand the situation you and your folks are in...more than you realize."

00:03:33 Eli Grey says, "Oh boy."

00:03:43 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:03:45 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "You do not understand!"

00:04:00 Aisling the Fox says, "That is the whole point of this."

00:04:12 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

00:04:27 Aisling the Fox says, "But drop it. Just drop it."

00:04:37 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not wish to discuss it further. Just forget it."

00:04:38 Morris says to Aisling, "I don't? I don't know what it's like for lives to be in danger? I can't understand because I didn't live the exact way you did? It's impossible? How do you not get that folks can understand, can get it...even if the situation isn't exactly the same?"

00:04:52 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

00:04:56 Morris Corlew sighs.

00:04:58 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:04:59 Morris Corlew lopes south.

00:05:03 Aisling the Fox growls.

00:05:18 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I've seen that tactic before. Make a statement, run off."

00:05:53 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes. I am sorry. I did not wish to cry in front of everyone."

00:06:06 Aisling the Fox sighs.

00:06:28 Eli Grey says, "Hey it's ok, perfectly normal biological function."

00:06:33 Vernos Bailey nods.

00:06:39 Aisling the Fox says, "It is hard keeping it together all the time and putting on happy face."

00:06:57 Damien says to Aisling, "Now that I completely understand."

00:07:11 Aisling the Fox says, "That I am sure others can."

00:07:38 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, this one girl gave me a note and ran off, that's mostly what I was thinking of. I think it was about sex."

00:07:42 Damien says to Aisling, "You should have met me 3three years ago when I first became a pilot."

00:07:57 Aisling the Fox says, "But Morris cannot understand what it is like to have a ship full of people, their lives, depend on you."

00:08:04 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

00:08:44 Aisling the Fox looks at Damien Goss thoughtfully.

00:08:50 Aisling the Fox asks, "Why is that?"

00:08:54 Melinda Michaels says, "I have not had this happen to me either. However, I understand that it has to be terrible feelings and scary because of the tragic implications."

00:09:10 Melinda Michaels says, "So that is understanding."

00:09:28 Aisling says to Melinda, "Perhaps understand is not quite the right word."

00:09:34 Eli Grey says, "Kinda sounds like the problem here, is the word "Understand" sounds like there's a bit of a difference in what they are meaning."

00:09:38 Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.

00:09:49 Damien Goss says, "I was stillrecovering from serious emotional trauma and I kind of had major anger issues."

00:09:59 Melinda says to Aisling, "Sympathize."

00:10:06 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:10:16 Aisling the Fox says, "Empathize."

00:10:24 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay here is part of the problem."

00:10:29 Melinda Michaels says, "And I'll be honest."

00:10:41 Melinda Michaels says, "I don't like people telling me how I feel or that I am stupid reg either."

00:10:45 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Come on though, Morris has had a case against us for a while now. Cycles and cycles, and it was even before the Kelsey thing. Maybe it started with Akemi, I don't know. Maybe before that."

00:11:00 Melinda Michaels says, "That's hurtful too."

00:11:36 Melinda Michaels says, "So everybody says and does things because of whatever is causing this tension thing. Like Cheri said, there has been something for awhile now."

00:12:11 Aisling says to Melinda, "Repeatedly said it has nothing to do with anything like that. What I experience does not make me better or you worse. Just experiences cannot all be... empathized with unless you too have experienced it."

00:12:22 Aisling the Fox says, "Not saying Morris or anyone is stupid."

00:12:44 Eli says to Aisling, "Yeah, I sorta get that."

00:13:17 Aisling the Fox says, "I get he is trying to say he understands. But at same time he does not fully. And then has to argue over it."

00:13:39 Melinda says to Aisling, "You see, it's not the same situation but, I have experienced loss of loved ones, we all have. So people take offense when they get told nobody understands. People understand loss, maybe waiting for something bad to happen while a loved one is fighting for life. Everybody knows somebody that has had that and gets it."

00:14:04 Melinda Michaels says, "That's the roadblock."

00:14:37 Eli Grey says, "It doesn't compare to what unregs have to deal with, but it's kinda like how everyone is always saying my skin is cool, and they may even have some empathy about it, but they haven't experienced walking through their home town and folks looking at you like you're a freak or like they are scared."

00:14:48 Damien Goss nods.

00:14:59 Damien Goss says, "That's actually a pretty good comparison."

00:15:11 Aisling the Fox nods to Eli Grey.

00:15:49 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, the point is, we all have shit."

00:15:55 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:16:09 Eli says to Melinda, "And what you said was said very well, just saying."

00:17:00 Melinda Michaels says, "Like sure, I may be stupid reg but do you think I want to be called it? No, same as you wouldn't ant to be called stupid unreg. It's hurtful."

00:17:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Anyway, I am done."

00:17:22 Melinda Michaels says, "Sorry."

00:17:26 Aisling says to Melinda, "Have I called you stupid reg though?"

00:17:38 Melinda says to Aisling, "I am not pointing at you literally."

00:17:50 Melinda says to Aisling, "These are just htings that happen."

00:17:55 Aisling the Fox says, "Frankly I feel more stupid that I think most regs are."

00:18:07 Melinda says to Aisling, "Well you are not."

00:18:09 Aisling the Fox says, "Than I think."

00:18:26 Aisling the Fox says, "There are many things I do not know and do not understand."

00:18:37 Melinda Michaels says, "We are all that way if we admit it."

00:18:46 Damien Goss says, "That's par for the course, if you are human."

00:18:48 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:18:56 Eli Grey says, "Everyone is ignorant, just depends on about what."

00:19:02 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know or understand what Anfisa's life was like. She is not reg. But we are vastly different."

00:19:44 Melinda Michaels says, "We can't truly know something that we have not experienced. We can only show some understanding to various aspects of a situation."

00:19:58 Aisling the Fox points vaguely off into space.

00:20:04 Aisling the Fox says, "That is what I am saying."

00:20:06 Cheri Lindbergh says, "That's what Aisling was saying."

00:20:10 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah."

00:20:13 Melinda Michaels says, "Right but."

00:21:04 Aisling the Fox says, "I feel like this has less to do with anything other than Morris wanting to pick fights with me."

00:21:06 Melinda Michaels says, "Morris is saying he understands, I'll say it too. I understand it has to be terrifying to worry about your family like that. That they will be gone because I know this pain of losing people."

00:21:22 Melinda Michaels says, "So everybody is correct."

00:21:30 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:21:41 Damien says to Aisling, "Let me ask you a question about something you said earlier?"

00:21:41 Aisling the Fox says, "He seems very quick to do that. He did not engage Anfisa in this conversation. He engaged me."

00:21:47 Cheri says to Aisling, "I feel like he's doing that too."

00:21:55 Aisling says to Damien, "Sure."

00:22:11 Melinda Michaels says, "Then find out why he is picking fights, there has got to be an underlying issue. I think Cheri alluded to that."

00:22:19 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Too bad he's not here so he could explain things or help us come to some understanding."

00:22:29 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Morris."

00:22:35 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes?"

00:22:40 Aisling the Fox says, "He will just deny it."

00:22:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'll go start venting sections of the ship starting from aft so he'll be driven back in here."

00:22:48 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a white leather sofa.

00:22:49 Damien says to Aisling, "When you told Morris he didn't understand about your specific situation about your home and family. Did you mean the specific situation or just a general concern?"

00:22:53 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Nissi Valdaire.

00:22:55 Aisling the Fox grins at Nissi Valdaire.

00:22:57 Nissi Valdaire glances around at her surroundings.

00:22:58 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

00:23:03 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Come back in here and we are not going to argue."

00:23:24 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Sort this out before it gets worse."

00:23:36 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sounds like an argument waiting to happen."

00:23:37 Cheri Lindbergh says, "It depends on what you mean by arguing."

00:23:46 Aisling says to Damien, "The whole thing. That I have a ship full of people whose lives depend on me. That is not an experience he has had to deal with."

00:23:48 Melinda Michaels says, "Yelling and stomping out."

00:23:51 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

00:23:54 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

00:24:13 Cheri Lindbergh says, "No punching."

00:24:19 Aisling the Fox asks, "Kicking?"

00:24:23 Melinda Michaels says, "No."

00:24:26 Aisling the Fox sighs at Melinda Michaels.

00:24:27 Aisling the Fox grins.

00:24:41 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Come on."

00:24:44 Cheri Lindbergh says, "No accidentally swinging your arms and just happening to slap somebody."

00:24:51 Damien Goss nods. "Ok, I am not saying one way or the other but that may have been a point of miscommunication."

00:24:52 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:25:07 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

00:25:08 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah I understand what he means by the understanding thing."

00:25:20 Morris Corlew begins leaning against a bulkhead.

00:25:41 Aisling says to Damien, "It would not be first time I have had communication error. I am not best ad doing this."

00:25:46 Melinda says to Morris Corlew, "Right then, tell her what you mean by you understand her situation."

00:25:51 "Me too!" Damien Goss nods.

00:26:01 Morris Corlew lowers his head.

00:26:13 Damien Goss says, "I suck at expressing my self sometimes, that's why I try to just shut up and listen, heh."

00:26:13 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

00:26:20 Morris says to Aisling, "Do you understand the difference between experiencing a situation and having empathy?"

00:26:53 Morris quickly rubs at his eyes, turning away briefly.

00:27:12 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

00:27:32 Aisling the Fox says, "Sympathy is when you are feeling bad for a person. Empathy is when you have had experience that person has had and can speak to it."

00:27:46 Damien Goss exclaims, "Wait!"

00:27:51 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Empathy doesn't require having had the exact same experience."

00:27:56 Eli Grey says, "I.. don't think that's quite what empathy means."

00:28:15 Damien Goss says, "Empathy is when you can feel something someone else is feeling."

00:28:20 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

00:28:26 Damien Goss says, "So fear, roger, worry, roger, and so on."

00:28:40 Eli Grey says, "It works though, for the purposes of this discussion I think, lacking a better word."

00:28:48 Ather Jammoa asks, "Are we really discussing the differences between empathy and sympathy?"

00:28:50 Morris Corlew says, "It doesn't require that I have lost loved ones on a ship. It just requires that I 'get it.'"

00:28:56 Damien Goss says, "Well, there's sympathy, empathy, and understanding."

00:29:06 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

00:29:26 Damien Goss says, "Understanding is specific, empathy is general, sympathy is just expression."

00:29:32 Aisling the Fox says, "I just do know know if you do without having actually experienced it."

00:29:35 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

00:29:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "There's a difference between understanding that a thing happens and actually having past trauam about it."

00:29:46 Damien Goss nods.

00:29:48 Morris Corlew says, "No, I have not been on a ship in literal fear of my life. I know that our ship safety systems are damn good. But anything can fail."

00:29:50 Melinda says to Aisling, "Okay, that little girl."

00:29:53 Ather says to Nissi, "It's OK if I feel no sympathy, right?"

00:29:53 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire. "This is my point."

00:29:55 Nissi Valdaire says, "Or trauma even."

00:30:05 Damien Goss looks at Ather Jammoa and shrugs. "Some people don't."

00:30:20 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's why they vote Best."

00:30:24 Morris Corlew says, "I have felt other loss. I have felt in danger of my life. Heck, I've put myself in those situations."

00:30:25 Melinda says to Aisling, "I was stupid reg and helped you because I understood your worry and grief. I got that you needed to know for sure to have peace of mind. So I tried to help, do you see?"

00:30:34 Ather Jammoa glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:30:47 Aisling the Fox says, "You were not stupid."

00:30:56 Melinda says to Aisling, "Do you see what I mean though?"

00:30:57 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:31:07 Aisling the Fox says, "But yes. I know that."

00:31:14 Melinda says to Aisling, "That's what he is saying."

00:31:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Same thing."

00:31:18 Aisling the Fox says, "But there is still a difference I think."

00:31:24 Aisling the Fox says, "And that is what I am saying."

00:31:35 Aisling the Fox says, "I just do not know words for it."

00:31:39 Morris Corlew says, "Differences are what drive us. None of us has the exact same experience."

00:32:12 Morris Corlew says, "But we can have empathy for each other. We can 'get it.' Being lumped into 'Reg this' and 'Reg that' hurts, Aisling."

00:32:14 Damien Goss says, "So, I have a suggestion. I read this in a book somewhere a long time ago."

00:32:23 Cheri says to Morris, "Well I do that plenty."

00:32:28 Morris says to Cheri, "I know."

00:32:32 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "So?"

00:32:48 Morris Corlew asks, "So it's ok for y'all to say hurtful things to and about us, but not if we do it? Even by accident?"

00:33:19 Morris takes a deep breath and rests is head against the bulkhead closing his eyes for a moment.

00:33:19 Aisling the Fox says, "And I am believing you cannot fully appreciate the feeling someone has unless you have had it yourself. You can understand if that is how you want to say it sure. But there is difference from understanding and sharing experience."

00:33:32 Ather Jammoa asks, "Bah, people say shit about the AEU all the time too. Who cares what people label you long as you know what you are?"

00:33:35 Aisling the Fox says, "I appreciate you understand. I am not saying I do not."

00:33:36 Cheri says to Morris, "What are you even talking about?"

00:33:52 Morris says to Aisling, "You act like you don't."

00:34:15 Cheri says to Morris, "You keep jumping out to questions that assume we know what you're talking about."

00:34:16 Nissi Valdaire says, "The universe isn't a level playing field. Our people were basically hunting their people for sport not too long ago. We still have a lot more than they do."

00:34:22 Aisling the Fox says, "I act like I don't like it when you seemed to insist you knew exactly what I was going through."

00:34:28 Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner and nods to Nissi Valdaire.

00:34:38 Eli says to Morris, "Maybe next time, just say 'I feel for you'?"

00:34:38 Nissi Valdaire says, "So yes being anti-reg is not as bad as being anti-spacer."

00:34:46 Morris says to Eli, "I've tried that."

00:34:47 Eli Grey says, "That sounds like that's all he was trying to get at before."

00:34:51 Eli Grey shrugs.

00:34:51 Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.

00:35:52 Melinda Michaels shrugs. "We all have feelings, nobody likes to be put in a box or labeled as being different or less than others."

00:36:02 Damien Goss nods.

00:36:08 Ather says to Morris, "Back in the day, bounties were placed on all unreg ships. If we ever saw a salvage junker or whatever salvaging within the FTL beacon network, we'd do our best to shoot it down, then we'd shoot down any ships that they called to aid it."

00:36:15 Morris Corlew says, "I have no control over what folks did before I was even around here...before I was even born. None whatsoever. But...somehow it's ok for me to be lumped into the folks that did these horrendous things, but it's not ok for 'unregs' to be lumped together when as a group the bad things have been done too."

00:36:30 Morris nods emphatically in Melinda's direction.

00:36:55 Cheri says to Nissi, "I gotta say, I'm not really anti-reg and any reg who's my friend knows this. I don't even talk about it much, but it seems like when I do say something, anything, about regs, it sure gets noticed. Maybe that's because I yell a lot."

00:37:04 Ather says to Cheri, "Poacher stomp?"

00:37:05 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's how it is with everything. Like having an org just for women isn't sexist because of the whole history and context of it all."

00:37:08 Morris says to Ather, "I know this. I do. And it fucking sucks. 'Scuse my language. But it does. However, I couldn't do a damn thing to change it. So why am I lumped in this group?"

00:37:11 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Ather Jammoa.

00:37:19 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sexism and racism and all that, they're words that describe punching down. Not anything else."

00:37:24 Nissi Valdaire says, "Same way with spacers I'd say."

00:37:27 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

00:37:27 There is a sudden squeak from somewhere inside the starship, cut off with a crunch and the sound of scuttling legs.

00:38:01 Morris says to Nissi, "So...saying unflattering things about regs isn't the same?"

00:38:16 Ather says to Morris, "Well, you have to understand the mindset back in the day. If you were around then you would've probably done nothing to change it. Imagine...hmm, let's put this into perspective."

00:38:29 Morris says to Ather, "How do you know that?"

00:38:31 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Oh yeah, I don't hesitate to say shit about unregs either. Anybody can tell you that."

00:38:38 Ather says to Morris, "Imagine 10 years from now, Kelsey's allied faction was also made into an alliance. Offered pardons, whatever."

00:38:41 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

00:38:43 Ather Jammoa says, "Kinda like that."

00:39:10 Morris says to Ather, "Blowin up his ships doesn't end lives. Just takes from his coffers a bit."

00:39:12 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't like being lumped in any more than anybody, but I understand the reasons for it and it's hard to get too offended when you know the history."

00:39:40 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly. "I've never gotten offended at being called a reg."

00:39:43 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "It just...it bothers me to basically be lumped in with folks who did somethin I cannot see myself doin, period."

00:39:44 Ather Jammoa says, "I -am- a reg."

00:39:53 Melinda says to Cheri, "Yes, you will go at whomever you need to. It doesn't matter, that's the right way."

00:40:03 Morris says to Ather, "It's the attitude with it, not just the word."

00:40:07 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Melinda Michaels. "I've been trying to calm down."

00:40:15 Ather says to Morris, "Still doesn't bother me."

00:40:37 Ather Jammoa says, "The stereotype is there no matter what."

00:40:38 Morris says to Ather, "So just 'cause somethin don't bother you it shouldn't bother nobody else?"

00:40:55 Morris says to Ather, "Yes, and the stereotype is wrong, and often plum hurtful."

00:41:14 Ather Jammoa says, "You were a planetborn member of the League of Old Earth Democracies. You are a reg. That label is not incorrect. It is what it is. If you read more into it, well, that's all you, pal."

00:41:23 Melinda says to Nissi, "That's the thing though, some people can take more hits and shake it off. Others, it cuts."

00:41:35 Morris says to Ather, "It's more than the label. It's the attitude and biases that are attached to it."

00:41:45 Eli Grey says, "I mean.. it's really just short for "registered individual""

00:41:48 Morris nods sadly to Melinda.

00:42:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure, but to us it's just an annoying word. To them, until a few years ago, that unreg label meant they basically weren't human. Could just murder em and no consequences."

00:42:06 Ather Jammoa says, "Cheri, Pierre and Aisling use to call me a reg all the time! Heck, the first time I ever met Aisling, she called me an Outsider. Not knowning what she was referring to with the word, I actually think I was more ofefnded at first at being called an Outsider than I ever was at being called a reg."

00:42:13 Ather Jammoa chortles.

00:42:20 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Aisling the Fox. "That's pretty funny."

00:42:28 Morris Corlew says, "You can call me a Reg all day long. I know what it technically means. But when you start implyin or statin outright I can't feel somethin, can't understand somethin 'cause I lived most of my life on a planet, that's where I have an issue."

00:42:29 Damien Goss smiles.

00:42:47 Damien says to Aisling, "That is pretty amusing, I wish I had heard that."

00:43:23 Aisling the Fox says, "Eachtrannach means outsider. Not Outsider."

00:43:29 Morris Corlew says, "When it comes down to it, we're all human."

00:43:39 Ather Jammoa grins at Aisling the Fox.

00:43:44 Aisling the Fox says, "As in, you are an outsider to my group."

00:43:44 Ather says to Damien, "See?"

00:43:46 Morris Corlew says, "There are good 'regs' and bad 'regs.' Good 'unregs' and bad 'unregs.'"

00:44:00 Ather says to Damien, "But when she elaborated, I shrugged it off again like 'Unreg'"

00:44:09 Damien Goss nods.

00:44:24 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, think about Aisling's people. We're all outsiders to them. So what, it's just how they think of things, it doesn't mean anything about who you are inside. This is just dumb."

00:44:28 Morris Corlew says, "Lump folks all in together and try and fit 'em into a neat little box, it just don't work."

00:44:37 Ather Jammoa says, "I was pretty much just like eh, fuck it. Call me whatever floats your boat. You don't know what I think about you in my head."

00:44:38 Ather Jammoa smirks.

00:44:42 Damien Goss says, "Like I said earlier I don't have a problem being called a reg. I just have a problem telling me how and what I think."

00:44:46 "It's not the word." Morris Corlew shakes his head. "That's what I'm tryin to say. It's the attitude and accusations that go with it."

00:45:04 Morris says to Damien, "Thank you."

00:45:12 Ather says to Aisling, "I use to make fun of you behind your back do you care."

00:45:43 Aisling the Fox asks, "Used to?"

00:45:49 Aisling the Fox says, "I assume you still do."

00:45:51 Eli says to Morris, "We also hae to know who we are ourselves though bud. When that girl said all AEU pilts should be fired, I honestly didn't think she was talking about me personally."

00:45:51 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, it's more fun to do it outright, I admit."

00:46:02 Ather Jammoa says, "So now I don't even bother to make fun of you behind your back."

00:46:07 Eli says to Morris, "Don't get me wrong, I can understand that it's frustrating."

00:46:09 Morris says to Aisling, "And that don't bother you, but it bothers you that I think I can feel things you don't think I'm capable of?"

00:46:09 Cheri says to Eli, "It's like, people say shit, so what?"

00:46:30 Aisling the Fox says, "Ather is like stupid brother."

00:46:35 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

00:46:37 Morris Corlew says, "'Cause that shit hurts sometimes."

00:46:38 Aisling the Fox says, "It is expected."

00:46:45 Morris Corlew shakes his head.

00:46:46 Ather Jammoa says, "And aisling is like annoyingly annoying and overly obnoctious sister that is never ever taken seriously."

00:46:52 Ather Jammoa pats Aisling the Fox on the back.

00:46:55 Aisling the Fox nods.

00:47:43 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

00:47:58 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:48:22 Melinda Michaels says, "I think the best we can do is try to be mindful of others feelings. Try to understand where they are coming from before getting all upset."

00:48:33 Eli Grey smiles at Melinda Michaels.

00:48:34 Eli Grey nods.

00:48:34 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Melinda Michaels and nods and nods and nods.

00:48:36 Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:48:37 Ather hmms.

00:48:41 Ather Jammoa looks at you and shrugs.

00:48:43 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

00:48:48 Ather Jammoa looks at Eli Grey and shrugs.

00:48:49 Ather Jammoa nods.

00:48:56 Cheri says to Melinda, "Well, I'm fine with that but not to the point where I shut up for fear of offending somebody."

00:49:05 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I'm going to go check things!"

00:49:06 Ather Jammoa stands up from a white leather sofa.

00:49:06 Ather Jammoa strides south.

00:49:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "And Ather was never seen again."

00:49:34 Melinda Michaels laughs.

00:49:39 Aisling the Fox asks, "So question remains. Does Morris like to argue with me for some reason?"

00:50:00 Eli Grey says, "I wasn't here when this all started, but it definintely sounds like the two of you got caught up on the word "understand""

00:50:01 Morris says to Aisling, "I actually hate when I argue with you. I think way more than you realize."

00:50:05 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I feel like he does. And he likes to dig on me too, like with that stupid fucking letter of dots. How stupid."

00:50:06 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

00:50:22 Aisling the Fox asks, "Then why argue with me?"

00:50:32 Melinda says to Cheri, "Yeah I don't think anybody is asking you to shut up. The difference is, when you speak, you fully understand you may get something back and are prepared to handle it. Others, get hurt and upset."

00:50:33 Morris says to Cheri, "It was a joke."

00:50:45 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

00:50:45 Cheri says to Melinda, "Oh, I am!"

00:50:47 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.

00:50:48 Aisling the Fox says, "Was hurtful joke. How rude."

00:51:04 Ather Jammoa says to Nissi, "By the way, if we do run out of probes on this thing, I do have 55 more on invocation that we could use."

00:51:09 Morris Corlew asks, "Wait, sending a little drawing on a letter...a line...is a hurtful joke?"

00:51:14 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, it's not likely that we will, but well."

00:51:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Just I don't have any impact ones."

00:51:44 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:51:52 Eli says to Ather, "What happened to your head?"

00:51:55 Eli Grey says, "You got a big bruise."

00:51:57 Aisling says to Morris, "Are you going to say what is hurtful to Cheri?"

00:52:00 Ather says to Nissi, "But I'm pretty sure if we used probes on invocation everyone on the science vessel will get credited."

00:52:10 Morris Corlew sighs to himself and shakes his head as if to himself.

00:52:17 Cheri says to Morris, "You know what I was thinking you were sending, that letter you were sending to everybody else except me. You took the time to send it, I went to Tandem thinking it was something worthy, and it was some fucking dots."

00:52:19 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:52:22 Ather says to Eli, "As always, the same thing that happened to my head that has happened for the last year or so."

00:52:25 Ather says to Eli, "Aisling."

00:52:32 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Ather Jammoa yells, "Oort!"

00:52:41 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Dammit. Oort. Become something interesting!"

00:52:49 Damien sticks a finger in one ear and wiggles it a little bit.

00:52:52 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

00:52:53 Aisling the Fox grins.

00:52:57 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

00:52:59 Morris says to Cheri, "I...I'm sorry. It was a joke...I thought better than than a random SSN gift, which have gone...wrong before."

00:53:04 Damien Goss says, "Thanks, I knew there was something I was missing today."

00:53:14 Eli Grey grins at Aisling the Fox.

00:53:16 Eli Grey grins at Ather Jammoa.

00:53:24 Eli Grey finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:53:28 Morris says to Cheri, "I wish you'd told me sooner it upset you. It certainly wasn't intended to. I can...get you a copy of that letter if you'd like."

00:53:33 Aisling the Fox says, "Ather's face just loves coming into contact with my fist."

00:53:38 Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway, next time we use invocation I'll make a more even distribution of probes."

00:53:41 Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

00:53:59 Eli Grey says, "Your face is a fist? Nah.. damn I'm just not good at like you two are."

00:54:03 Eli Grey shrugs.

00:54:09 Eli Grey says, "Mine all sound stupid."

00:54:16 Damien says to Eli, "It's the sibling rivalry."

00:54:18 Ather says to Eli, "Cause you're too innocent, pal."

00:54:36 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

00:54:56 Eli Grey asks, "Your mom's innocent?"

00:54:58 Ather says to Aisling, "Your fist tends to miss me so many times that I'll probably worry more about the people around me than my own face."

00:55:02 Eli Grey says, "Damn.. nope.. I guess you are right."

00:55:09 Anfisa of Marzore stumbles in from the south.

00:55:31 Ather Jammoa chuckles.

00:55:36 Melinda says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Hello."

00:55:39 Ather says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Nice outfit."

00:55:49 Morris says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Good wakin cycle."

00:56:15 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Oh, Thank you."

00:56:51 Eli says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Don't think I've seen one of those on someone so tall."

00:56:54 Eli Grey grins at Anfisa of Marzore.

00:57:01 Eli Grey says, "Looks good."

00:57:10 Morris Corlew examines an emerald green ice cream dispenser for a moment.

00:57:10 Morris Corlew presses a gold button on the front of an emerald green ice cream dispenser. The contraption hums and gurgles for a moment; then the noise dies away, and a small bowl of cold creamy vanilla ice cream is deposited into the dispensing area in the front, which he promptly retrieves.

00:57:18 Aisling the Fox takes a sip of a bottle of room temperature fizzy cola.

00:57:26 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small bowl of cold creamy vanilla ice cream.

00:57:32 Anfisa of Marzore says, "I have worn it before."

00:58:17 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

00:58:18 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small bowl of cold creamy vanilla ice cream.

00:58:49 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small bowl of cold creamy vanilla ice cream.

00:59:00 Morris Corlew sighs at a small bowl of cold creamy vanilla ice cream.

00:59:02 Morris Corlew gives a small bowl of cold creamy vanilla ice cream to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

00:59:07 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

00:59:07 Morris Corlew pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

00:59:17 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

00:59:31 Morris Corlew examines a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

00:59:33 Morris Corlew makes a selection on a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of white paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into his waiting hand.

00:59:35 Morris Corlew switches on a personal filing computer.

00:59:41 A fair-skinned man looking uncannily like Eli Grey walks into the room, holding a steaming cup of coffee.

00:59:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

00:59:48 Anfisa of Marzore examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

00:59:49 The fair-skinned Eli Grey lookalike glances up and nods to most of you.

00:59:49 Eli Grey says, "Um."

00:59:51 Morris Corlew blinks.

00:59:55 The fair-skinned Eli Grey lookalike notices Eli Grey and begins staring at him with increasing horror.

01:00:01 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Anfisa of Marzore removes a small round personal vegetable pizza from the open compartment.

01:00:05 The fair-skinned Eli Grey lookalike drops his cup, but both the liquid and the lookalike fade away before the cup hits the floor.

01:00:09 Eli's eyes grow  wide in surprise.

01:00:14 Eli Grey asks, "You guys.. seeing this?"

01:00:14 Anfisa of Marzore examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

01:00:15 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

01:00:16 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

01:00:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hmm."

01:00:24 Eli Grey asks, "Um.. Hello?"

01:00:25 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes."

01:00:30 Morris Corlew says, "He..."

01:00:32 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

01:00:43 Anfisa of Marzore helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

01:00:44 Morris Corlew pokes and prods at an empty white coffee cup with purple accents.

01:00:52 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:00:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Maybe this was past Eli and he could not handle his skin being so glowy."

01:00:56 Morris Corlew stops leaning against a bulkhead.

01:01:02 Morris kneels down to inspect an empty white coffee cup with purple accents.

01:01:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Wow."

01:01:11 Morris glances up at eli.

01:01:13 Anfisa of Marzore calmly sips her coffee. "Hmm. Not sure if we have enough capacity to support two of you.

01:01:25 Melinda Michaels grins at Anfisa of Marzore.

01:01:27 Aisling the Fox says, "Interesting."

01:01:42 Damien Goss removes a miniature bronze holovid from a fanny pack.

01:01:44 Damien Goss turns a miniature bronze holovid on.

01:01:51 Eli Grey pokes and prods at a cup.

01:01:54 Aisling the Fox puts a space imaging photograph of a small bright dwarf star in a worn and tattered brown leather satchel.

01:01:54 Damien Goss sighs.

01:01:57 Aisling the Fox picks up an empty white coffee cup with purple accents.

01:01:58 Damien Goss puts a miniature bronze holovid in a fanny pack.

01:02:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "What if... the remaining Eli is the fake one?"

01:02:10 Eli Grey says, "I'm... kinda shaken up.."

01:02:24 Damien Goss says, "Other dimensions."

01:02:25 Melinda says to Eli, "I'll bet you are."

01:02:28 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

01:02:30 Damien Goss closes a fanny pack.

01:02:33 Anfisa of Marzore says, "You might have to sleep in same bed if he shows again."

01:02:41 Anfisa of Marzore asks, "Is okay, yes?"

01:02:48 Eli Grey gives a day old small cactus to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

01:02:52 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:02:54 Aisling the Fox gives an empty white coffee cup with purple accents to Eli Grey.

01:03:02 Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

01:03:06 Eli Grey pokes and prods at an empty white coffee cup with purple accents.

01:03:44 Melinda says to Eli, "That comparison you made, then he shows up. Welcome to the rift."

01:03:48 Eli Grey asks, "I wonder why the cup didn't vanish?"

01:04:03 Eli Grey says, "My god.. that was me,  that was really me. Not just me seeing things."

01:04:07 Aisling the Fox says, "Because it is all real."

01:04:09 Morris Corlew shakes his head at Eli Grey. "Same reason the book didn't...I dunno."

01:04:17 Rogue Romano glances around at her surroundings.

01:04:25 Aisling the Fox takes a sip of a bottle of room temperature fizzy cola.

01:04:43 Eli Grey says, "Hmm. I haven't seen myself look like that in along time, amost didn't recognize him er.. me at first."

01:04:47 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:04:52 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

01:04:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I have not met melty rift Pierre yet, but I am sure he is very swell person."

01:05:31 Aisling the Fox nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:05:53 Eli Grey says, "Ti's got.. some residue."

01:06:05 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey. "I noticed that."

01:06:23 Eli Grey sniffs at an empty white coffee cup with purple accents. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

01:06:32 Eli Grey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

01:06:42 Eli Grey removes an empty sample container from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

01:06:43 Damien Goss asks, "Does it smell like normal coffee?"

01:06:50 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:06:53 Eli says to Damien, "Yeah.. it seems perfectly normal."

01:06:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "If you absorb the residue of rift Eli, you might gain its powers."

01:07:31 Eli Grey puts an empty sample container in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

01:07:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It works for weird bari meat and glowing vials."

01:08:01 Cheri says to Morris, "Anyway, the point is, you can go on acting like all this shit upsets you, but if you're doing the exact same thing to other people, not thinking about their feelings whatever you do or say, then don't talk about how precious you are. And by the way, I wasn't so hurt about it. I was annoyed that you wasted my time playing a dumb game with me when you made me think it wasn't a dumb game."

01:08:21 Eli grins sheepishly at Pierre-Louis.

01:08:27 Morris Corlew looks at Cheri Lindbergh thoughtfully.

01:08:29 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "So.. what you are saying is I should lick the cup."

01:08:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Grind and snort it through nose."

01:08:55 Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.

01:08:55 Damien Goss says, "Ack."

01:09:11 Morris says to Cheri, "Look. I realize I make mistakes and say the wrong thing. But I admit that I do it. Not make excuses why it's ok."

01:09:20 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That is how you gain power from rift leftovers."

01:09:32 Morris Corlew puts a sheet of white paper on a maple coffee table.

01:09:37 Morris says to Cheri, "It's there if you want it."

01:09:42 Eli Grey says, "Man on ISN said rift food was alright."

01:09:45 Eli Grey glances at an empty white coffee cup with purple accents.

01:09:54 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:10:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, no one snorted the rift sandwiches."

01:10:20 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Did we get a cup of insanity tea delivered?"

01:10:43 Cheri says to Morris, "What's there if I want it?"

01:10:56 Morris says to Cheri, "The paper I just put on the table."

01:11:28 Cheri says to Morris, "I told you Aisling posted it for us."

01:11:45 Morris says to Cheri, "I did not hear you with the excitement goin on."

01:12:33 Cheri Lindbergh says, OOCly, "Sorry, I typed it but had to reconnect. It didn't actually go through."

01:12:53 Morris Corlew says, OOCly, "Ehh, don't worry about it. I just figured I missed it. Heh."

01:13:27 Anfisa of Marzore takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

01:13:57 Eli Grey asks, "You guys are incredibly calm about an alternate version ofme wandering in here and vanishing. I take it you folks are used to this sorta thing?"

01:14:00 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Okay. So there are three Elis, and just one of them is the real Eli. Which do you pick first?"

01:14:09 Morris Corlew asks, "Wait, three?"

01:14:09 Eli Grey asks, "Wait.. there's 3 now?"

01:14:12 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

01:14:15 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:14:17 Melinda says to Nissi, "Door number 2."

01:14:18 Damien Goss exclaims, "The one that gives the thumbs up!"

01:14:20 Cheri says to Morris, "But anyway, if you have issues with me, you need to talk to me. I'm not a monster, I'm a real reasonable person most of the time. I even stood up for you when Akemi was talking shit, remember?"

01:14:25 Eli says to Lily Kaise, "Oh shit are you eli too?"

01:14:33 Lily Kaise says, "What the."

01:14:41 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:14:45 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah I think so!"

01:14:46 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Okay. I can tell you for sure that Eli #3 is a fake. Now do you want to stick with #2 or switch to #1?"

01:14:52 Morris says to Cheri, "You also called me all kinds of names when we supposedly broke some ceasefire nobody felt the need to tell us existed."

01:14:53 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:14:53 Lily Kaise glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

01:14:58 Aisling the Fox says, "I wonder if I can get to see a Rift Aisling from a time where I saved my ship and could ask if everything is okay."

01:15:00 Cheri says to Morris, "What names?"

01:15:04 Eli Grey grins at Nissi Valdaire.

01:15:06 Anfisa of Marzore says to Nissi, "Switch to 1."

01:15:13 Eli Grey exclaims, "Pick me!"

01:15:16 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:15:30 Lily Kaise puts a light green egg on a maple coffee table.

01:15:31 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Never mind. I'd rather just drop it."

01:15:32 Cheri says to Morris, "Did I call you a reg? Was that it?"

01:15:35 Eli says to Nissi, "Thanks.. that.. actually makes fel a little better for some reason."

01:15:40 Morris says to Cheri, "No."

01:15:43 Lily Kaise glides east.

01:15:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "We've seen duplicates before... or Morris has... so it's not a new thing really, just really rare."

01:16:05 Eli Grey nods to Nissi Valdaire.

01:16:05 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

01:16:08 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

01:16:11 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:16:21 Melinda says to Nissi, "Always switch."

01:16:22 Morris says to Eli, "I saw Nissi's alternate...but...I didn't actually recognize her at first."

01:16:23 Melinda Michaels beams.

01:16:24 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just slightly alternate versions of us doing the same sorta thing at the same sorta time and intersecting for a moment."

01:16:31 Eli Grey says, "It was just weird.. seeing myself looking normal."

01:16:31 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

01:16:37 Aisling the Fox says, "I would rather see rift stone bird and ask if things are going well for him."

01:16:37 Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:16:37 Morris says to Eli, "Yeah."

01:16:38 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:16:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:16:53 Aisling the Fox says, "I felt bad for him dropping his namestone."

01:17:02 Lily Kaise removes a semi-transparent egg from an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

01:17:06 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

01:17:10 Lily Kaise puts a semi-transparent egg on an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

01:17:17 Lily Kaise removes a pale purple efficient round egg storage container from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

01:17:17 Cheri says to Morris, "What was it? I mean you just called me out on this. You gonna leave the accusation out there without backing it up?"

01:17:18 Eli Grey says, "So.. somewhere there's an Eli that's also exploring with you guys, and who is now probably freaking out about his cup vanishing and now has coffee all over him."

01:17:36 Eli Grey says, "Werid."

01:17:39 Eli Grey says, "Er.. weird."

01:17:40 Lily Kaise asks, "What the... did I just walk in on anyway?"

01:17:42 Morris says to Cheri, "Let it go please. I don't want to keep this going. I'm trying to let things be peaceful."

01:17:54 Lily Kaise puts a pale purple efficient round egg storage container in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

01:18:01 Lily Kaise removes a semi-transparent egg from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

01:18:07 Lily Kaise puts a semi-transparent egg on a maple coffee table.

01:18:43 Cheri says to Morris, "Nah, see. I don't call people lots of names. I got a few standard names but that's about it. Reg, dumbass, fucker. Motherfucker. Was it one of those?"

01:18:53 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh wow we've traveled over 200 LTC how awesome is that!"

01:18:59 Morris says to Cheri, "Along those lines, yes."

01:19:13 Melinda says to Lily, "Awesome."

01:19:18 Lily Kaise grins at Melinda Michaels.

01:19:31 Morris says to Cheri, "I knew you were upset, I tried not to take it personal, so I don't remember the exact names...just that it happened."

01:19:48 Lily Kaise says, "All I can say is please folks lighten up? We have at least another week to tolerate one another. I don't like the sight of blood."

01:20:10 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

01:20:12 Morris says to Lily, "Nobody's throwin punches. Not physical ones anyhow."

01:20:21 Eli says to Lily, "Hey.. when you were in the hall, did you see someone that looked like me, except with normal skin?"

01:20:27 Lily Kaise says, "Well the verbal ones seem to be getting pretty hefty."

01:20:34 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

01:20:39 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:20:44 Lily Kaise says, "I won't say anything else."

01:21:04 Melinda Michaels says, "I am going to hide for a minute."

01:21:06 Melinda Michaels grins.

01:21:07 Melinda Michaels stands up from a white leather sofa.

01:21:08 Melinda Michaels strolls east.

01:21:16 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:21:19 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:21:20 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:21:24 You say to Lily, "Hi love."

01:21:24 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:22:29 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:23:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "So that was an amazing discovery you all did earlier. I so wish I could have been available to observe that. 5 planets!"

01:23:39 A black digital felo game beeps plaintively for food.

01:23:46 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "Yep."

01:23:54 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

01:23:54 A black digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

01:23:59 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

01:23:59 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

01:24:06 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

01:24:20 Lily Kaise says, "'there are a couple more eggs for the taking there as well."

01:25:49 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:25:58 Lily Kaise smiles at you and squeezes you affectionately.

01:26:34 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:26:44 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I would like to declare to a person that I am very insulted by a past or present thing they did."

01:26:59 Aisling the Fox grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:27:04 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's verns birthday!"

01:27:13 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "If ti's that time I farted on a beacon, I told you I was sorry."

01:27:38 Cheri stares at Morris a few moments then shakes her head and says, "Nah, see. It's out there now. People going to think I cussed you to your face even if I deny it. You made the accusation and now you want to drop it and you're saying vague shit about me being upset to keep it going. It's not honest. It's real dishonest, in fact.

01:28:00 Morris says to Cheri, "What, you want me to dig out a tape or somethin?"

01:28:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec nods to Eli Grey.

01:28:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "A tape? I have no of the tape, but I do have a disc."

01:28:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" from a small black leather backpack.

01:28:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" in a silver projector.

01:28:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

01:28:40 [From the projector] The camera shows some archival footage of the Premier Maxime Roberge eating a poutine. Offscreen, you can hear something said in a French Rimward accent, "Allo! These are more best moments of WMOS! Enjoy more the moss! Ha! Ha!"

01:28:54 [From the projector] The view pans slowly through a lush forest.

01:28:59 [From the projector] A fallen tree trunk gradually comes into view as the camera pans.

01:29:02 Eli says to Nissi, "Wow, not even the appearance of my doppleganger could end their argue."

01:29:04 [From the projector] Once the tree trunk is centered in view, the camera zooms in slowly.

01:29:07 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

01:29:10 [From the projector] You see a patch of greyish green upon the surface of the tree trunk. The camera continues zooming in.

01:29:15 Lily Kaise whistles.

01:29:18 [From the projector] It becomes clear that the greyish green patch growing on the tree trunk is indeed moss, perhaps lichen.

01:29:23 Nissi Valdaire says, "If only that oort cloud had been something good."

01:29:25 [From the projector] The camera zooms in to show the fine details of the mossy growth.

01:29:31 [From the projector] After a long, lingering gaze at the moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.

01:29:33 Lily Kaise points at an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

01:29:34 Cheri says to Morris, "I was asking for details because if it was really that harsh, you probably woulda remembered. But you don't."

01:29:38 [From the projector] A deep voice intones gravely, "You are watching... The Moss Channel."

01:29:44 [From the projector] The image fades to black for a moment.

01:29:51 The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.

01:29:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" from a silver projector.

01:29:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" in a small black leather backpack.

01:30:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:30:38 Morris opens his mouth to say something and immediately closes it. He then turns to Cheri and says quietly, "I'm not gonna keep an argument goin for the sake of arguin. If you wanna keep goin, fine. But you're doin it without me."

01:30:40 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

01:31:11 Lily says to a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, "Ok we know what you have there. Just keep them secured."

01:31:23 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:31:28 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

01:31:28 You stroke a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

01:31:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Opik could have been Outsider patrol, that would gotten some attention."

01:31:45 Morris Corlew examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

01:31:47 Morris Corlew helps himself to a cup of hot chamomile tea.

01:31:49 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

01:31:51 Cheri says to Morris, "It's just lies I can't stand."

01:32:06 Cheri Lindbergh shrugs. "But I'm done, whatever."

01:32:10 Morris appears to bite his tongue and winces.

01:32:29 Eli Grey puts an empty white coffee cup with purple accents in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

01:32:54 Anfisa of Marzore says, "She has point. Someone once said applicable phrase here is 'Shit or get off pot.' - if you have issue, is best to resolve quickly."

01:33:00 Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:33:06 Lily Kaise strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

01:33:11 Anfisa of Marzore sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:33:14 Anfisa of Marzore takes a bite of a small round personal vegetable pizza.

01:33:16 Morris stares into a cup of hot chamomile tea but says nothing.

01:35:34 Eli Grey says, "Seeing that other me has got me thinking about when a bunch of us got letters from ourselves years ago."

01:35:54 Eli Grey says, "I don't think I still have the copy of them sadly."

01:35:56 Morris says to Eli, "I saw that book that was put together once. Was...freaky."

01:36:01 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

01:37:09 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

01:39:21 A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it passes.

01:39:30 Cheri Lindbergh finishes off a glass of cold fizzy cola.

01:39:40 Cheri Lindbergh stands up from a white leather sofa.

01:39:54 Cheri Lindbergh gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

01:40:04 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "I'm gonna take a rest. I'll be back!"

01:40:09 I don't understand that.

01:40:10 Lily Kaise waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

01:40:11 You wave to Cheri Lindbergh.

01:40:13 Cheri Lindbergh says, "You lucky scrubs."

01:40:16 Cheri Lindbergh waves.

01:40:16 You say to Cheri, "Rest well."

01:40:17 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:40:19 Cheri Lindbergh walks south.

01:40:31 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Have a good sleep cycle Cheri."

01:40:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:40:50 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yeah, rest well."

01:40:55 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:41:00 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:41:07 Eli THUMBS a small silver dragonfly on a chain THOUGHTFULLY.

01:41:12 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

01:41:37 Lily Kaise pats a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly lightly.

01:42:53 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

01:43:29 I see no "dragonfly" here.

01:43:34 a hand-made blue and red dragon quilt [inside a leather briefcase]

01:43:34 This soft, heavy quilt is hand-sewn of angular sections of light and dark blue and red synthcotton, some sections printed with small flowers and stars on backgrounds of the predominant colors. A large angular blue dragon is centered on the top side of the quilt with smaller sections arranged by color and shape around it. The fiberfill between the two sides is kept in place by through-stitching, creating a image in matching thread on the solid blue back of the quilt.

01:43:50 a black filtration mask lightly tinted with royal blue dragons [inside a black engineering tool case]

01:43:50 This mask is made of a silky black material lightly tinted with royal blue dragons. With an elasticized loop on each side, it is designed to stay in place over the mouth and nose. A passive cool ventilation valve on the side reduces moisture and heat build-up.
It covers your face.

01:44:50 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the east.

01:45:12 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

01:45:36 Morris glances up at Melinda Michaels, a frown etched on his face and attempts to smile. "Yo."

01:45:42 You say to Melinda Michaels, "Hi."

01:45:44 Melinda Michaels nods to Morris Corlew.

01:45:51 Melinda says to you, "Hi."

01:46:53 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:48:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Remember that Opik-Oort that was on sensors a few mincycles ago? Those are good times."

01:49:03 Morris Corlew says, "Heh."

01:49:06 You grin.

01:49:08 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

01:49:08 Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

01:49:16 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

01:50:13 Rogue Romano yawns.

01:50:51 Rogue Romano says, "I'm goin' to rest for a bit. See you guys in a lil' while."

01:50:56 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

01:50:57 Melinda Michaels nods.

01:50:58 Morris says to Rogue, "Rest well."

01:51:04 Rogue Romano nods and waves.

01:51:07 Rogue Romano slinks south.

01:51:30 There appear to be about 20 pilots recently active.

01:51:30 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:

Additionally, there are 8 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 28 pilots.

01:51:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:51:43 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Night Rogue."

01:53:09 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:53:14 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

01:53:45 Morris glances up and seems to relax slightly.

01:53:51 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

01:54:51 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]

01:54:51 Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender sky. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a soft square brown floor cushion, Manx the little calico CatBot, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
Damien Goss is seated. Aisling the Fox is sitting on a round saffron orange zafu. Morris Corlew is sitting on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow.
01:54:51  Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow. Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec, Eli Grey, Nissi Valdaire, Ather Jammoa, Anfisa the Wanderer, and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a white leather sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:55:39 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

01:59:50 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

02:00:00 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

02:00:20 Thuds echo throughout the ship as micrometeorites slam into the hull.

02:01:02 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

02:01:49 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters into the room.

02:01:54 Magellan the arachnoid security robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks.

02:01:57 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters south.

02:02:06 Eli Grey says, "DAMN, SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE CHARTED THOSE STARS."

02:02:09 Eli Grey grins.

02:02:14 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:03:00 Aisling the Fox says, "Quick, launch charting stations and wait at least 50 cycles for observation."

02:04:07 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:04:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:06:40 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

02:06:53 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:08:40 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

02:08:53 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

02:10:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I mean, you could have recorded each stop we had on computering machine but it will not stay long enough in it to be all that relevant."

02:14:31 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:15:02 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:15:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:17:21 Eli Grey blinks heavily and then dozes off.

02:18:38 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

02:19:03 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

02:20:28 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "I could probably chart some of the systems. Well off my chart now, however."

02:22:04 Aisling the Fox nods.

02:22:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Mine too."

02:22:09 Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

02:22:12 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:22:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Farport is on edge of my charts, not very far from it."

02:22:45 Aisling says to Anfisa of Marzore, "How many lightyears does your chart cover around Helios?"

02:24:49 You examine an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

02:24:49 What would you like?

[1] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio
[2] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel
[3] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir
[4] Cafe Pepe (Secret Recipe) Sangria
[5] Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco

Enter your selection:

02:24:51 You help yourself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

02:24:55 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

02:25:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:25:41 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

02:25:57 Anfisa of Marzore says to Aisling, "Ehhh, is not centered on Helios, so depends on direction."

02:26:31 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

02:26:45 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:26:57 Aisling the Fox says, "Coreward from Mutuality space? Assuming not too far."

02:27:30 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:28:56 Aisling the Fox says, "I had asked Council for possibility of comparing my home chart to their giant chart. But would need you to probably find location if you could. I have not heard back from request. Liaison said it was a big one. But if we could match my location up to a larger chart, could be much easier to find my home ship."

02:29:11 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not read that chart though."

02:29:50 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Well, that would be travelling tangent to chart's radius. Covers enough territory."

02:29:51 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

02:30:21 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:30:53 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:31:41 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

02:31:52 Use what?

02:31:56 Use what?

02:32:50 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:33:29 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:33:32 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:33:34 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

02:34:09 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

02:34:18 Vernos Bailey gives a foam cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:34:23 Morris says to Vernos Bailey, "Happy birthing day."

02:34:24 Lily Kaise waves to Vernos Bailey.

02:34:26 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

02:34:40 Vernos Bailey glances down at his tasteful gold watch with diamond accents momentarily.

02:35:03 Vernos Bailey says, "Well its 0034 now, so I guess my birthday is over."

02:35:11 Morris Corlew says, "Oh hmm."

02:35:13 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

02:35:16 Vernos Bailey yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

02:35:26 Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

02:35:29 Morris Corlew says, "Well, at least I did say it this mornin."

02:35:32 Morris Corlew grins.

02:35:39 Lily Kaise says, "Well guess that took all his energy to say that."

02:35:47 Vernos Bailey says, "We can still celebrate it though."

02:35:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Will just be a day late."

02:36:00 Lily Kaise grins.

02:36:13 Morris Corlew says, "Nothin wrong with that."

02:36:14 Lily says to Vernos, "Well I had no idea so happy birthday."

02:36:18 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:36:19 Lily Kaise glides east.

02:36:27 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

02:36:31 Lily Kaise gives a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake to Vernos Bailey.

02:36:40 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That's the only cake I can find!"

02:36:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:36:49 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:37:06 You say to Vernos, "Happy birthday."

02:37:29 Vernos Bailey says, "Thanks."

02:37:43 Lily says to Vernos, "And let's see, since nobody has taken them you may want to help yourself to the eggs on the coffee table."

02:37:44 Vernos Bailey says, "I know what my celebration will be when I return to beaconed space."

02:37:50 Lily Kaise grins.

02:37:54 Lily Kaise asks, "What will it be?"

02:37:56 You grin.

02:38:14 Vernos Bailey says, "Twenty loads of salvage and harassing some Outsider Patrols."

02:38:19 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:38:23 You grin.

02:38:46 Thuds echo throughout the ship as micrometeorites slam into the hull.

02:39:11 Vernos Bailey says, "The second one even in celebration for my birthday will not be done lightly and will consist of total seriousness."

02:39:27 Lily Kaise says, "I'm trying to remember when I did a salvaging mission. I was working on our org's Industry but after that I just haven't done much and I think that was perhaps 8 months ago at least."

02:39:31 Morris Corlew looks at Vernos Bailey thoughtfully.

02:39:51 Morris says to Vernos, "We need to teach you to party."

02:40:19 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:40:29 Vernos says to Morris, "Maybe that is how I party?"

02:40:35 Morris Corlew grins at Vernos Bailey.

02:40:39 "Well, you worked on industry for the org a lot." You grin at Lily Kaise. "You're entitled to a nice long break."

02:40:53 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:40:57 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:41:05 Lily Kaise says, "We're still not where I want it to be but there's no rush."

02:41:10 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:41:12 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters east.

02:41:18 Anfisa the Wanderer takes a bite of a small round personal vegetable pizza.

02:41:51 Lily Kaise says, "We'll get the 65 Exploration we need to obtain the Lab when we get back so that's just awesome."

02:42:12 You exclaim, "Well, my evasions aren't where I'd like them to be yet and yeah, we will. That'll be cool!"

02:42:19 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:42:53 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:49:00 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

02:49:10 Morris Corlew says, "Rift bari."

02:51:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We cannot stop now, speed is too good."

02:51:15 Lily Kaise grins.

02:51:19 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

02:52:41 You grin.

02:52:53 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:53:12 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:53:20 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:54:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:55:01 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

02:55:05 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:55:26 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Go play now, we've had our cuddle time."

02:55:30 Lily Kaise grins.

02:55:32 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

02:55:38 You grin.

02:55:42 Morris says to Lily, "Oh. Thought you were talkin to Shule for a sec."

02:55:43 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:55:47 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:55:50 You chuckle.

02:57:00 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well I don't have to give permission to shule to play!"

02:57:03 Lily Kaise grins.

02:57:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:57:08 You laugh and grin.

02:57:30 Lily Kaise says, "If I thought so, he would anyway."

02:57:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:57:37 You laugh.

02:57:39 You say, "Very true."

02:58:00 Lily says to you, "Which is why I love you so because you are your own man."

02:58:10 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I love yo too."

02:58:15 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:59:27 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

02:59:33 Morris jerks.

02:59:37 Morris Corlew sighs.

03:00:48 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

03:00:58 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

03:01:08 Vernos Bailey says, "Well at least those two illusions make sense."

03:01:26 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:01:47 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Is not illusion so much."

03:02:12 Vernos Bailey asks, "What is it then?"

03:02:23 Vernos Bailey asks, "An actual lock at some point in time?"

03:02:43 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "It is the rift. It is real and unreal."

03:02:56 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

03:03:13 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Simply sitting on the surface, largely protected from entities."

03:04:18 Aisling the Fox says, "Best not to provoke them."

03:04:28 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:07:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:07:59 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:08:21 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:12:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly west.

03:12:56 Morris Corlew finishes off a cup of hot chamomile tea.

03:13:00 Morris Corlew gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:13:41 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

03:13:43 You finish off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

03:13:49 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:13:57 Anfisa the Wanderer takes a bite of a small round personal vegetable pizza.

03:13:58 Anfisa the Wanderer takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

03:14:11 You can't drink a goblet.

03:14:22 You give a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:16:37 Aisling the Fox finishes off a bottle of room temperature fizzy cola.

03:16:42 Aisling the Fox gives a bottle to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:18:54 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:19:41 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:20:04 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:20:10 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:29:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

03:29:49 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:29:56 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:30:49 A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.

03:30:54 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:32:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:32:31 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:34:51 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:34:51 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

03:35:08 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

03:35:16 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

03:38:02 Lily Kaise says, "Wow the speed is awesome especially that we're not in a storm."

03:38:14 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

03:38:43 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

03:38:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Nothing out there but vacuum."

03:40:54 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

03:41:03 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:41:11 Morris Corlew asks, "Uh...we're a nice ship of folks...don't eat us?"

03:41:55 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

03:43:12 [MTTS] Ulias: Is the "In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around" thing ever going to be sued or maybe it already is? I've never seen anything detected that's not in the rift.

03:43:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:43:53 [MTTS] Ulias: Perhaps I just haven't ran into the situation, so sorry if that's just a premature question.

03:44:00 [MTTS] usfolks: It is used in a few instances. One I can think of off the top of my head.

03:44:34 [MTTS] Ulias: Ah ok, cool. I'm glad because it seems neat to be able to see something like before you drop out or whatever ti's for.

03:44:51 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:45:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

03:49:23 You say, "Well, night all. I'm going to go start winding down for sleep."

03:49:37 Morris says to you, "Rest well."

03:50:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ipll put his crank in the appropriate place!"

03:50:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:50:33 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:50:46 Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

03:50:48 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:50:51 You wave.

03:50:52 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:50:54 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:50:56 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]

03:50:56 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

03:50:57 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Mid A]

03:50:57 You see a black plastic tray of spider chow, a Tardick lizard named Raissa, and a Tardick lizard named Freyja here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

03:50:58 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Mid B]

03:50:58 You see a small bubbling white-lit aquarium containing crimson and blue aquatic life and round rocks and a large bubbling azure blue-lit aquarium containing violet aquatic life and round rocks here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

03:50:59 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Aft]

03:50:59 You see a small bubbling neon blue-lit toroidal aquarium containing blue and red aquatic life and round rocks and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, east, and west.

03:51:00 You can't go that way.

03:51:01 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

03:51:01 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go east.

03:51:12 You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers off of your feet.

03:51:15 You put down a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers.

03:51:16 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

03:51:17 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

03:51:20 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

03:51:24 Lily Kaise puts down a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes.

03:51:27 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

03:51:32 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:51:35 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:52:03 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

03:52:40 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:53:16 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

03:53:24 You say to Lily Kaise, "I love you."

03:53:31 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:53:35 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:53:56 Lily Kaise smiles at you. "I love you too."

03:54:02 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:54:13 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:54:21 Lily Kaise says, "I'm so glad we were able to participate with this crew in spite of Morris's being a drama queen."

03:54:32 You say, "Me too."

03:54:34 You grin.

03:54:35 Lily Kaise says, "As well as Aisling doing essentially the same."

03:54:44 You say, "Yeah, exactly."

03:56:25 You say, "Maybe we should lock just the two of them in a room and let them argue their hearts' delight with each other."

03:56:33 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

03:56:47 You chuckle.

03:56:54 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

03:56:57 Lily Kaise says, "You know that would be sooo tempting if I were the captain of this ship."

03:57:00 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:57:02 You laugh.

03:57:10 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok you two go duke it out!"

03:57:11 You say, "Yeah, same here. Probably a good thing I'm not."

03:57:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:57:23 You laugh.

03:58:28 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah me too. I wouldn't have sent them back in an escape pod but I would give them a warning that the antagonism was not going to yield any positive results and if they didn't cease, I would be so tempted."

03:58:45 You say to Lily, "Well, rest well and sweet dreams. I should really go to sleep. I love you more than anything! And I definitely agree."

03:58:53 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:59:44 Lily says to you, "Ok Love, rest well and sweet dreams. I love you so much. I cherish every bit of time we have together. Sweet dreams Hun."

04:00:03 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Thanks. I do too."

04:00:31 Shule embraces and kisses you, "Night."

04:00:35 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:00:56 Lily embraces you and says Nite Love.

04:01:18 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

04:01:28 Listen. You need to be careful.

04:31:19 Do you know what they want?

04:37:12 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Goss."

04:41:49 No one knows who you really are. The thing you keep buried and hidden behind your fake smiles.

04:52:00 They stare at you. Of course they do.

05:02:13 Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.

05:02:40 Remember what I said.

05:02:50 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

05:32:42 A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it passes.

05:33:45 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

05:44:19 Small, bioluminescent alien insects flit above the grass, flashing bright purple hues.

05:53:11 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

05:53:11 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

05:53:21 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

05:56:07 The tunnel around the ship shudders, and a gush of blood is suddenly filling it.

05:56:07 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

05:56:09 The blood rushing around the ship gradually clears up.

05:56:10 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

05:56:12 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

05:57:06 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

06:00:29 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

06:00:29 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:00:39 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

06:01:10 He will find you at any moment! Run!

06:01:10 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

06:01:13 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

06:01:54 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

06:01:55 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:02:05 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

06:05:28 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

06:05:28 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:05:39 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

06:06:36 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

06:06:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

06:06:37 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:14:54 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is help needed outside."

06:29:44 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:29:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:29:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:29:57 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

06:30:04 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

06:30:35 Enemy gunfire erupts at the far end of the trench, and a group of soldiers rush over to defend the area.

06:30:35 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

06:30:38 Enemy gunfire erupts at the far end of the trench, and a group of soldiers rush over to defend the area.

06:30:49 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:31:01 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

06:31:09 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:31:14 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

06:31:20 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:31:26 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:31:29 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:31:31 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

06:31:33 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

06:31:35 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

06:31:37 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

06:32:07 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

06:33:04 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:38:35 Anfisa the Wanderer's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Strange storm. We were just translated 7.8 light-trade cycles."

06:38:44 Anfisa the Wanderer's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Going to take us back in."

06:38:45 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:38:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:38:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:38:59 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

06:39:05 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

06:39:24 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

06:40:40 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

06:40:40 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:40:50 Listen. You need to be careful.

06:42:36 Remember what I said.

06:42:37 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:42:47 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

06:44:21 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

06:46:02 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

06:46:02 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:46:12 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

06:47:25 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

06:48:51 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

06:48:52 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

06:50:29 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

06:50:29 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:50:39 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

06:51:50 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

06:51:50 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:52:00 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

06:53:19 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

06:53:20 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

06:55:50 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

06:55:50 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:56:00 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

06:57:15 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

06:57:15 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

06:57:25 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

06:58:32 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

06:58:33 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

06:59:27 Anfisa the Wanderer's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well."

07:00:52 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

07:00:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:01:02 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

07:04:36 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

07:04:37 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:04:47 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

07:06:59 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

07:07:00 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

07:10:28 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

07:10:28 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:10:38 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

07:11:24 The dark clouds overhead suddenly break, letting the sunlight in as the seas calm.

07:11:25 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

07:11:27 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

07:11:51 Dark clouds roll in, and the wind picks up as the surrounding waves grow choppy.

07:11:51 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

07:11:52 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

07:11:54 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

07:12:13 The dark clouds overhead suddenly break, letting the sunlight in as the seas calm.

07:12:16 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

07:12:51 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

07:12:55 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

07:12:55 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:13:05 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

07:14:02 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

07:14:02 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:14:12 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

07:17:15 Two massive hands reach down and pick up the fishbowl, jostling and sloshing everything inside.

07:17:15 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

07:17:16 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:17:18 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

07:17:18 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

07:18:33 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:18:34 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

07:19:48 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:19:49 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

07:19:51 There's a strong bump from beneath the fishbowl as it is placed in a new location. The hands which were carrying it fade away.

07:19:54 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

07:20:49 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:21:42 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

07:21:42 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:21:52 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

07:23:11 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

07:23:11 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:23:22 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

07:24:37 Webbing all around suddenly breaks, and the ship swings wildly through space.

07:24:37 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

07:24:38 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

07:24:40 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

07:25:54 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

07:25:54 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:26:04 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

07:26:29 The room ceases to spin.

07:26:29 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:26:32 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

07:41:04 The room begins spinning around you.

07:41:05 The stage lights flicker briefly.

07:42:05 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

07:42:14 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What time is it?"

07:42:41 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "0542. Good morning, Aisling."

07:43:09 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello Luja."

07:49:47 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

07:49:48 You hear a wet tearing sound.

07:50:48 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

07:53:33 The room begins spinning around you.

07:53:33 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:53:45 The room begins spinning around you.

07:54:33 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

07:55:30 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

07:55:33 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:56:15 You begin dry heaving.

07:56:15 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

07:56:40 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

07:56:40 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:56:54 You gag slightly.

07:56:55 The stage lights flicker briefly.

07:57:06 You begin dry heaving.

07:57:07 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

07:57:37 You begin dry heaving.

07:57:46 The room begins spinning around you.

07:58:06 You hear a wet tearing sound.

07:58:13 The room begins spinning around you.

07:58:27 You begin dry heaving.

07:58:44 The room begins spinning around you.

07:58:44 The stage lights flicker briefly.

07:58:44 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

07:58:44 A trio of stars orbit together here, two larger stars close together, with a third dwarf star orbiting their combined center of mass. This is a highly unstable system for any planets, but the ship's sensors indicate some small likelihood.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:59:38 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Three stars. Interesting."

07:59:44 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

08:00:01 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Fairly bright."

08:01:24 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am unfamiliar with using mainframe."

08:02:17 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Me too, I'm not helping up here."

08:14:02 Cheri Lindbergh's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gotta sleep, I love you all right now."

08:14:18 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sleep good, Cheri."

08:14:43 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well."

08:17:59 Aisling the Fox's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "One rocky planet."

08:25:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:25:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:25:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:25:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:25:46 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

08:30:31 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

08:30:44 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:30:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:30:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:30:58 The starship has left a unique area of space.

08:31:04 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

09:00:54 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

09:11:17 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

09:13:54 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

09:19:08 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll stay dililgent Mister Frenchname."

09:24:21 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

09:31:22 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

09:31:32 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

10:01:23 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

10:05:42 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

10:05:43 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

10:05:57 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

10:06:11 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else?"

10:13:17 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:13:27 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

10:13:27 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

10:13:37 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

10:16:21 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

10:20:10 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nissi, we got it."

10:20:16 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

10:20:19 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Good job!"

10:20:33 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was just checking your work."

10:43:28 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

10:48:12 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

10:53:41 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

11:02:42 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

11:13:15 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

11:14:04 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

11:14:14 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

11:31:57 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

11:44:07 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

11:45:48 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh yeeeeaaaaah, complete that maintenance.

11:54:29 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

11:56:13 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

12:07:11 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

12:15:11 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

12:15:21 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

12:17:51 You hear a wet tearing sound.

12:28:38 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Eli."

12:38:12 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

12:48:26 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

12:57:54 You hear a wet tearing sound.

13:08:22 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

13:16:27 The curtains close, to no applause.

13:16:37 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

13:17:34 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:37:48 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:41:08 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Planets!!!"

13:41:59 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

13:41:59 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

13:48:46 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

14:00:07 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

14:00:07 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

14:00:20 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

14:00:20 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:20:39 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

14:33:41 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

14:50:30 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

14:59:21 The stage lights flicker briefly.

15:09:27 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

15:10:03 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

15:10:43 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Luja."

15:19:37 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

15:20:03 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out.

15:21:49 The curtains close, to no applause.

15:22:00 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

15:28:04 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

15:28:32 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

15:43:34 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

15:51:51 A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it passes.

15:53:34 A Tardick lizard named Raissa blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:00:04 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

16:02:03 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

16:03:26 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

16:13:44 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

16:23:54 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

16:24:12 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

16:24:22 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

16:54:13 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

17:04:27 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

17:15:03 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

17:25:25 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

17:25:34 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

17:25:44 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

17:55:35 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

18:06:01 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

18:16:09 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

18:21:16 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

18:26:33 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

18:26:43 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

18:56:34 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

19:07:00 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

19:07:18 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

19:08:18 A Tardick lizard named Raissa's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

19:17:14 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

19:20:18 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

19:22:48 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

19:27:43 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

19:30:02 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

19:30:11 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

19:37:04 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.

20:00:03 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

20:10:38 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

20:21:18 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

20:28:39 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

20:28:39 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

20:31:13 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm almost certain these don't have planets, but think Nissi'd be bothered if I took the time to survey anyhow?"

20:31:22 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

20:31:32 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

20:31:33 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

20:31:41 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't think so. Because if say they did and it has like 5 or 6 planets in it.. Uh, yeah."

20:31:47 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

20:31:58 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Just wanted to check with other folks first."

20:36:01 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Considering these are pretty rare, think it's worth an observation probe or no?"

20:36:14 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

20:36:14 Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.

20:37:07 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was gonna do a close approach, but...wasn't sure about the observation one. They can take an hour or more."

20:40:22 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Her instructions were save probes for nice things. This is a nice thing. I would think it is anyway."

20:42:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Send both probe programs. Praise the stars."

20:59:17 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

20:59:17 Five stars orbit each other here in a complicated ballet, both dwarf stars and main sequence stars. Readings indicate this formation is probably unstable; within a few million years, one or more of the stars may end up ejected from the system.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

20:59:22 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wheeee."

20:59:34 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.
