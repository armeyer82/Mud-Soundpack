For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets over a black g-string with tiny metallic studs. She is wearing a pair of sexy black leather combat boots over a pair of ribbed black anklet socks on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a lovely rose gold ring with "my love" engraved on it, a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit,
