00:37 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

Hello!

As has been somewhat evident, the administration team has been lacking in some areas. For various reasons, most of us are simply not able to dedicate as much time to Miriani as we once could. To alleviate this ongoing problem, we're hiring new hosts in the following areas:

   Builders - These people will be responsible for creating new areas in the game. They will be able to create new planets/space stations as required, but should adhere to the guidelines we set forth. Unlike what has been done in the past, we will provide new builder hosts with a beginning project that they should aim to complete, and once it has been completed, the new builder can work with us to commence building on a project that they would like to see in the game. Information on their initial project such as lore and backstory will be pre-determined by us (the wizards). They will also work with the event hosts to develop new areas that may be required for events. To receive an application, type HOST-APPLICATION.
 
  Event Hosts (aka event planners and carry outers) - These people will be responsible for planning and carrying out in-character events. This includes doing the work required to set up the environment (creating sectors, ships, planets, etc) as well as any character roleplaying involved to facilitate the event. They will also be responsible for discipline during their event and any rewards that should be given at the end of an event. Any events should be cleared with the majority of hosts before beginning. We expect event hosts to have a firm grasp of game mechanics and plot, as well as a strong ability to think on their feet and anticipate the outcome of any action they perform in character. To receive an event host application, type EVENT-APPLICATION.

   Programmers - These people will be responsible for developing new, large-scale systems for the game. Additionally, they will be tasked with fixing existing bugs, closing reports, and implementing player suggestions. They should have ample experience in working with MOO code or an intuitive understanding of the semantics of object-oriented programming, and should not have any penalties for scripting or cheating. To view the programmer application, visit http://www.toastsoft.net/programmer_application.txt. Once you've filled it out, send it along in an email to hosts@toastsoft.net.

You should be aware that none of these positions are paid, nor will you receive any in character benefits. The return on investment rests purely in the warm and fuzzy feeling that you get when players enjoy a new area, event, or system you've created yourself. Pla
01:04 yers with numerous policy violations need not apply, as we have little reason to trust you with any sort of administrative duty in the first place. Applicants should at the very minimum possess a moderate to advanced proficiency with the English language and spell checking, know how to use the shift key and put punctuation where it belongs, and be a team player.

So, what do you need to know:
   Builder Hosts:   Type HOST-APPLICATION. This creates a builder application. WRITE APPLICATION to fill it out and SUBMIT APPLICATION when you're done.
   Event Hosts:   Type EVENT-APPLICATION. This creates an event host application. WRITE APPLICATION to fill it out and SUBMIT APPLICATION when you're done.
   Programmers: Point a web browser to http://www.toastsoft.net/programmer_application.txt. Save the document, fill it out, and send it to hosts@toastsoft.net when you're done.

If you've already written an application and feel you could improve upon it, feel free to resubmit it with your new answers. We sincerely appreciate the time that everyone has taken reading this or applying! We hope that with your help we can continue to make Miriani great.

01:08 [General Communication] Joseph Navarro transmits, "Bay pending."

01:08 You receive a builder host application. Please WRITE APPLICATION to fill it out and, when you are finished, type SEND APPLICATION. Your application will be reviewed and filed and, when/if we start looking for hosts, it will be reviewed again with the other applications.

01:08 [General Communication] Dorion Hunter transmits, "Maybe your landing where I'm standing at."

Insertion point is before line 1.

Type '/help' for assistance, '/abort' to abandon.

01:08 >> Command Aborted <<

01:08 You see some questions on a builder host application...

1.) Real Name:

2.) Date of Birth:

3.) E-mail Address:

4.) Characters (past and present) on Miriani and the original Star Conquest (not Catalyst):

5.) Programming Experience (no experience programming is necessary to build, but it's nice):

6.) Why do you think you would make a good host?

7.) Please describe a spaceport for the Hale Collective. Try to keep it a reasonable length.

8.) Please describe a small clothing store for the AIE.

9.) Please describe a starship store for the Commonwealth.

10.) Please describe a room of your choosing. It must fit into the Miriani setting.

11.) Imagine you are the only host connected and you are suddenly barraged with tracebacks. Apparently something has gone horribly wrong and ships can no longer launch. You have no programming experience. What do you do?

12.) How would you respond if somebody assisted about a lost ship?

13.) What would you do if somebody were to assist and inform you that they lost points and would like them returned?

14.) If you are made a builder host, what do you plan to build?

15.) Finally, please include any additional information that you feel would be helpful in our decision making process.

16.) Please be aware that, if you are made a host, there are strict guidelines that you MUST follow AT ALL TIMES. You will also not be compensated in any way for your effort (except the wonderful feeling one gets when one creates a m
01:08 agnificent area for all to explore), as Miriani is completely non-profit, and you cannot and should not expect any benefits to your player character in game. It is also worth mentioning that our system of building has been modified from that of the default LambdaCore. If you do not wish to take the time to learn this system, please @abort now and trash this application. Also please understand that anything you build will become the property of Toastsoft and you should not expect it to be removed if you demand it. Do you understand this? Please respond with yes or no.

(You finish reading.)

01:09 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Zander to Bellerophon flight control, a Hale starship is firing at an AIE starship."

She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.

02:35 Calyssa Calaway snickers over the intercom.

02:35 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:35 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:35 The cannons are already loaded.

02:35 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:35 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

02:35 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

02:35 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:35 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:35 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

02:35 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:35 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:35 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:36 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:36 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

02:36 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:36 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:36 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:36 You peer southwest and see...

02:36 ["Magical Melody" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset and a twinkling strand of blue lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a soft baby blue fluffy engineer's chair here.
You see Moiraine Soto here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

02:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:36 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

02:36 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. A tall frosted glass glossy turquoise lamp is casting a warm coral white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

04:13 ["Magical Melody" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfy rich brown leather co-captain's chair, a silver trash bin, a highly polished rich brown mahogany trunk with clawed dragon feet, a violet medical drone, three compact violet security drones, a glittery lavender purple star-patterned gold armchair, a flappy duck on wheels, Caly the droid, Mikey the droid, a fuzzy blue security drone, and a fuzzy blue medical drone here.
