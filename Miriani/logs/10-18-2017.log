This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Monster Mash" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the four-person roborant "Nebuchadnezzar", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", and the one-person expediter "Star Journey" landed here.

08:50 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: The commands pages are great to have open. Ive got the player, combat, and ship commands tabbed on my browser, but ive noted certain things you have to go digging around for.

08:51 [Newbie] Brian Tortle: If we're gonna keep debating the purpose of the newbie channel, perhaps it'd be best to move it to the metafrequencies?

08:52 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Oh. So only HGC then.

08:52 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: It is a moon but reclassification makes the moon a planet in the system.

08:53 #$#hjelp

08:53 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Yeah... Ive done combat missions, but should probably get around to salvaging and such.

08:54 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: On the activity list you might also try your hand at planetary mining, or delivering mail, or couriering.

08:55 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Waaait.... Couriering, you use a dedicated courier ship? Alright, Ive got to try this out.

08:55 [Newbie] Orelia Christelia: Salvaging is very easy.

08:55 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: At 45 points you can also atmo salvage.

08:55 [Newbie] Orelia Christelia: You just have to find a good spot.

08:55 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Is there a difference between combat and license points? I have 20LP and 24.54CP.

08:55 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Yes.

08:56 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Licence points you gain through industrial actibity,combat points through combat,I.E missions.

08:57 #$#hjelp

08:57 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: License are general points, and combat points define what upgrades you get for ships, but license points also determine this too. The lore has descriptions of upgrades. A good example of this might be to go to Miriani, and see the relativity drive. It requires 100 license, 50 combat. Those are the requirements.

08:57 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Thank you, useful to know. That was confusing me.

08:58 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: To better describe the license point and combat point system. They work hand in hand to buy upgrades. There are upgrades that only need license. There are drones that only require license points. Droids are similar to this.

08:59 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Speaking of, where/how does one acquire droids?

08:59 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: You won't until 1500 points, but the planet is zander.

09:00 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Yeah, no, that's waaay off. Thanks, still. Adding to my notes.

09:00 #$#hjelp

09:00 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Before droids. Yu will discover specialty ships in the game too.

09:01 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Most of them start about 1100, or 1200 license, and a certain amount of combat to.

09:01 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Do you mean like roid haulers and fighters, etc?

09:01 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: No.

09:01 [Newbie] Orelia Christelia: No.

09:01 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Hale is antag, sentinel, and run about.

09:01 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: What he is refering to are alliance speciality ships.

09:01 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Antag is 1150 points, forgot the combat.

09:02 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Oh. Didn't know more ships existed. Interesting!

09:02 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Each alliance has a planet where the member of those alliance can have a look at those,but that's a ways off yet for you.

09:03 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Information on other alliance ships can be gained IC,though if you so wish,through talking and making friends with pilots of other alliances.

09:03 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: The special ships are usually nicely equipped with something standard ships don't have. Some have absoroption plating, some have kick butt cannons, special wormhole drives, etc.

09:03 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: They always have a weakness invariably.

09:03 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Someone mentioned one can remove upgrades from their lore. Cant find the command for it, however.

09:04 #$#hjelp

09:04 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Oh like sorting upgrades?

09:04 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Very cool. Aye, everything needs vulnerabilities to balance, after all.

09:04 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: The upgrades are added to lore computers through cards,which can be attached and removed.

09:04 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: No, like... Remove my biometric chip and install a photo chip.

09:05 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Crap. Apparently removing it will wipe my lore?

09:05 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Be careful with biometric cards. I think the game explains it but there will render the lores unuseable.

09:05 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Or something.

09:05 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: There should be other cards you could remove though,if all the slots are taken.

09:06 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: You can unload another card and acheive the same goal.

09:06 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Yep. Seems I screwed myself in buying that. Ah well.

09:07 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: The chip takes only one slot. Your lore has 4 slots in total I believe.

09:07 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: So you could still use the other 3.

09:12 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Curious... Is there any sort of library, or player-made repository of... Whatever players have made? RP, stories, news reports, rumors, poetry, whatever.

09:12 [Newbie] Brian Tortle: Check the Boards or the galactic news on your Lore.

09:12 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Gotcha.

09:13 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Players have written books,made videos that sort of thing. There's a store somewhere,which publishes all such shite.

09:14 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Cool, sounds interesting. I love writing stories about/in MUDS!

09:14 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Wonder if a player could make a sort of publicly accessible library for the hell of it. Wouldn't mind transfering famous poetry and books to the game piece by piece.

09:15 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Unlikely,though you could try and make compelations,there's also metaf 500 for conversations like these.

09:16 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Hmm. So, question. I'm planning to write a little journalistic piece about whatever artifacts a friend finds, for the hell of it. Just to add flavor and keep me occupied. Is that a thing in this game? RP news stories? Or just admin-news?

09:16 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Would largely depend on the hosts as to whether such would depend where those would fit in in the timeline and world of the game,though.

09:17 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Aww. So no cult of Cthulhu or beating people with a compedium of Lovecraft's short stories. Ah well.

09:17 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Players have submited content before,so cann be done talk to a host,though admin,through assists.

09:17 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Gotcha! Ill look into it, thanks.

09:17 [Newbie] Victor: If you send news stories to hosts@toastsoft.net, it's likely we'll publish them if you've edited and written it to fit in with our theme.

09:18 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: Thank you, victor. Is there any sort of written guideline, or perhaps an example one can use as a base template?

09:19 Kitty Mars hangs a silky periwinkle blouse with glittering rhinestones encircling the neckline in a white wicker wardrobe.

09:21 [Newbie] Victor: The article titled "Massive Praelor Invasion Repelled: Picking Up the Pieces", visible in the NEWS-command in any starship control room, is an example of a player-written piece. Most news stories share the same stylistic format, however, regardless of them being by players or admins.

(Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

13:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

13:06 (Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" touches down smoothly on the ground.

13:06 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:06 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) You notice the windows of the one-person expediter "Dolphin" darken as the starship powers down.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" is suddenly seized by several robotic arms and hauled into the starship garage.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

13:06 A high-capacity transparent Lore computer beeps quietly, indicating that its TransLink tracking functionality has been activated.

The white walls are plastered with advertisements, and a small video screen on the western side is playing the galactic news at a low volume.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

14:30 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

14:30 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

14:30 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:30 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" is suddenly hauled onto the landing pad by several robotic arms.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

15:44 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:44 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Acrylon.

15:44 The ship is already moving.

15:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:44 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

15:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:44 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

15:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:44 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

15:44 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:44 You don't see that here.

15:44 I don't understand that.

15:44 You must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

15:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:44 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

15:44 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

15:44 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

15:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

15:44 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

15:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:44 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:44 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:45 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:45 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:45 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:45 The computer announces, "Four planets have been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "Jump complete."

15:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Set.

15:45 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:47 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:47 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:47 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:47 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:47 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:48 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:48 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

15:48 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:48 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:48 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

15:50 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

15:50 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:50 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:50 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Rolling Pop Can" has exited from Mission Jumpgate.

15:51 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

15:51 You must stand up first.

15:51 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

15:51 You stand up.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

15:58 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, Mekensie the droid, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.

15:58 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub] (indoors)
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

20:09 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:09 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" is suddenly hauled onto the landing pad by several robotic arms.

20:09 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:09 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" rises smoothly off the ground and hovers for a brief moment before rapidly accelerating towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

20:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:09 A black leather briefcase is closed.

20:09 There are no ships here.

20:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:09 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

20:09 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:10 There is no repair in progress.

20:10 The computer reports the starship is headed for Shadius (2, 3, 4). The computer estimates approximately 24 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

20:11 You begin the landing sequence.

20:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:11 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:11 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

20:11 You must stand up first.

20:11 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

20:11 You must stand up first.

20:11 You stand up.

20:11 You don't see that here.

20:11 Mekensie the droid

20:11 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is wearing a blue cotton flower-print sundress.  She is wearing a pair of black leather high heels with streaks of silver in them on her feet. She is also wearing a green keychain with "The WildHorse Saloon" printed on it.
She is carrying nothing.

20:11 You say, "mekensie remote"

20:11 Mekensie the droid says in a soothing voice, "I'm not seeing my remote in your hands."

20:11 She looks like too much effort to carry.

20:11 A black leather briefcase is closed.

20:11 You open a black leather briefcase.

20:12 You don't see "mekenise" in a black leather briefcase.

20:12 You remove a droid remote titled "Mekensie" from a black leather briefcase.

20:12 You say, "mekensie keys"

20:12 ("Dolphin" Control Room) Mekensie the droid says in a soothing voice, "My keyring contains a "F6f Hellcat" key, a "Dolphin" key, a "Mischief" key, a "Starlight Express" key, and a "Seventh Zin" key."
Mekensie the droid says in a soothing voice, "My keyring contains a "F6f Hellcat" key, a "Dolphin" key, a "Mischief" key, a "Starlight Express" key, and a "Seventh Zin" key."

Uncle Lyle keeps his establishment with the care and respect one might expect from somebody who cracks codes for a living. The majority of the room is cordoned off with bright red tape, creating a very narrow path up to a counter. Uncle Lyle himself does not make an appearance. Instead, his services are conducted through a clerk who seems to be no older than 17. Beyond the tape, you see a number of fascinating looking devices with no short supply of flashing lights and occasional beeps.

20:32 [Shadius; Docking Bay]
This dingy, run-down docking bay looks as if it should have been decommissioned years ago. Some kind of brown sludge has taken up residence here over the years, slowly trickling down the walls and collecting in pools on the floor. Puffs of smoke intermittently roll out of the ventilation system, momentarily filling the room with the acrid scent of burned wires and hot metal. Above you, light streams in from the now permanently open docking doors, providing enough illumination to reveal the areas of the docking bay that have been rusted by lack of care and excess rain. The scent of death and decay occasionally wafts in from the north.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage] (indoors)
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

22:37 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Furmoria" has launched from Rolukssica.
You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:37 ["Furmoria" Weapons Room 2] (indoors) (buckled into a tall aqua gunner's chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a shiny gold ship plaque and a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a tall aqua gunner's chair and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, southwest, and west.

22:38 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:38 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

22:38 Michael Johnson walks in from the west.

22:38 Tom Tucker's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Wheeeee! First mission on version 2 of this ship."

22:38 Michael Johnson walks west.

22:38 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "woo!"

22:38 Therman Donaldson's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "who's where"

22:38 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

22:38 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "What happened to version 1?"

22:38 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

22:38 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "In 2"

22:38 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

22:38 Michael Johnson walks in from the northwest.

22:38 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

22:38 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Furmoria" has initiated an intrasector slip.

22:38 Tom Tucker's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "It got puelled to death by a Muzano after my dart also got beaten."

22:38 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

22:38 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

22:38 Therman Donaldson's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "johnson come take 1. I'll go eng"

22:38 Michael Johnson walks southwest.

22:38 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Ouch!"

22:38 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Furmoria" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

22:38 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

22:38 Michael Johnson walks in from the southwest.

22:38 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

22:39 Tom Tucker's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "pummelled"

22:39 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

22:39 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

22:39 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

22:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:39 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "That sucks."

22:39 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:39 Michael Johnson walks west.

22:39 Michael Johnson walks in from the west.

22:39 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
