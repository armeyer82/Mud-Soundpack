the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see
some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep

[MTTS] rosey: So I am considering starting a new char after this current
roleplay event is over because I decided I want to go Fringe, can I use
the same name?
[MTTS] lunadrell has joined the channel.
[MTTS] rosey: Or maybe I will ask another way.
[0m18:00:00[0m
[MTTS] kanamoto: Probably best to change your name, as re-rolling
generally means you're starting a brand new character that has absolutely
no connection to your previous.
[MTTS] rosey: That is what I decided after I asked.
[MTTS] rosey: So after this roleplay event is up I will probably delete
and make a new char unless you think I could just delete in here?
[MTTS] something: What do you mean delete in here?
[MTTS] rosey: My char is in prison.
[MTTS] usfolks: Are they a cadet?
[MTTS] rosey: Yes.
[MTTS] something: If I were you I'd use the support command then.
[MTTS] rosey: I have nothing to lose and my reason for deleting would be
to make a Fringe char instead of league.
[MTTS] rosey: I did the assist command earlier.
[MTTS] something: That's basicly the same thing, you may have to wait for
a response from the staff.
[MTTS] rosey: And it is in the list when I typed support.
[MTTS] usfolks: Seeing as you're a cadet and therefore don't have a
profile accepted you'd probably be just fine to reroll. So either go
ahead and do it or wait till staff is available, up to you.
[MTTS] something: I don't think you can delete a character if it's in
jail like how you can't delete out of comms range.
[MTTS] rosey: Okay I will probably just go ahead and do it after I am
done doing what I am doing out of character.
[MTTS] usfolks: You can delete out of comms actually. It was done
recently.
[MTTS] something: Oh. The help file on rerolling made me think it could
not be done.
[MTTS] usfolks: Me too, until someone did it.
[MTTS] something: Occasionally you may TEMPORARILY be unable to delete
your character - this will always be for a specific reason: You are in a
liaison role, you are active in the middle of an ongoing plotline, you
are not in a location that makes sense for a character to 'retire' from,
or you have specifically requested that we make you unable to delete your
character.
[MTTS] something: That was the line that made me think.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yes, I know. But like I said, I did not know it was
possible until it happened.
[MTTS] rosey: The only way to delete is to log out and in again, correct?
[MTTS] usfolks: Yes.
[MTTS] rosey: I tested it and I need to wait but it won't be that long.

[MTTS] usfolks: Same as 2000 GMT.
[MTTS] usfolks: The game uses GMT but calls it GST.
[MTTS] rosey: I don't know how that compares with my time? How long is
that?
[MTTS] usfolks: No idea what "your time" is.
[MTTS] rosey: Central.
[MTTS] usfolks: 5pm.
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh.
[MTTS] usfolks: Uh...3pm.
[MTTS] usfolks: I apparenty can't subtract today.
[MTTS] Carroll: Is 2000 2 pm then?
[MTTS] usfolks: Central time is GMT -5 during daylight savings. So
therefore just subtract 5, which would be 1500, or 3pm.
[MTTS] rosey: Oh yes.
[MTTS] Carroll: Then is it not visiting hours now then?
[MTTS] usfolks: I...have no idea what visiting hours are.
[MTTS] rosey: Not til 3 my time.
[MTTS] usfolks: That answers your question then.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective
history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By
the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has
spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an
alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First
contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then
the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one
by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five
years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space,
bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this,
and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off
human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has
lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of
it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any
new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that
most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your
species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while
on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long
counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks
have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to
the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that
the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a
large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise
rattan table with a glass top, a bag of felo treats, and a pair of mystic
purple suede clogs here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
