00:31 Praelor Onati 327: 7, 4, 8

00:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:31 Current coordinates: 7, 4, 4

00:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:31 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Entryway.

00:31 Elijah Blackburn's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Doubt we have ground there were 33 up there"

00:31 You peer out and see...

00:31 [Humuhumunukunukuapua'a; Docking Bay]
This docking bay is a flurry of activity as people, drones, droids, and starships engage in a complicated tango of activity; somehow managing to stay out of each other's way. The only prevalent sound is the clattering of the deck beneath your feet as feet come into contact with it. A ladder leads up into the main complex.
You see the three-person heliogaster "Polaris" powered down here.
You see Hum the droid here.
You can go south and up.

00:31 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I didn't see any of the ships that usually bring ground."

00:32 #$#soundpack_pong

00:32 #$#soundpack_lag 110

00:32 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

00:32 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to green.

00:32 You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

00:32 Elijah Blackburn's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "We got this guys"

00:32 Ivan Cardenas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "unfortunately, OOCLY, I have to go"

00:32 Willow Sefdon's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "we didn't have Muzano or Ozarti. In fact, we didn't have Muz anything, so our lives just got easier"

00:32 Elijah Blackburn's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Oh boy"

00:39 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] You transmit, "Yeah, we're just about to go in."

00:39 Ivan Cardenas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I see nothings changed?"

00:39 [Short-range Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "Let me know when you launch."

00:39 Willow Sefdon's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Moiraine's taking the gunship up"

00:39 [General Communication] Katrianne Beauchene transmits, "Sorry I missed you all. Good luck."

00:39 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:40 #$#soundpack_pong

00:40 #$#soundpack_lag 105

00:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:40 [Short-range Communication] Willow Sefdon transmits, "And we're up."

00:40 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] You transmit, "I love you."

00:40 [General Communication] Elijah Blackburn transmits, "Meh if you can make it to 27 you could probably join."

00:40 Current coordinates: 6, 3, 3

00:40 [General Communication] Elijah Blackburn transmits, "Just orda and anati and stuff."

00:40 [General Communication] Elijah Blackburn transmits, "No muzati or other weird ones."

00:40 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:40 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.
You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

00:40 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Ophiuchus, there's a battle going on up there!"

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. You see a glowing picture frame containing a picture of a cylindrical spaceport floating through a mostly deserted sector hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go west.

01:48 You peer out and see...

01:48 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the six-person dart "Sea Turtle" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Alphy the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, Sinister the droid, a glowing blue medical drone, and a slim black security drone here.
You see Cris Smith here.
You can go northwest, east, and southwest.

01:48 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

01:48 You say, "enaia remote"

02:44 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] You transmit, "I'm coming back home."

02:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:44 Current coordinates: 18, 15, 14

02:44 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:44 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] Katrianne Beauchene transmits, "ok"

02:44 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:44 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:44 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

02:44 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:44 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

02:44 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:44 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

02:45 #$#soundpack_pong

02:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

02:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:45 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] Katrianne Beauchene transmits, "I'm not going to be the best company so if you really want to do other things, I don't want to keep you from that Love."

02:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:45 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:45 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Entryway.

02:45 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] You transmit, "I don't have much to do right now."

02:45 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:45 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

16:25 You can't go that way.

16:25 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:25 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

16:25 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

16:30 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
