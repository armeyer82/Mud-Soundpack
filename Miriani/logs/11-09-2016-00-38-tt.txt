#help session
Command: #session {name} {host} {port}

         Starts a telnet session with the given name, host and port.  The name
         can be anything you want, except the name of an already existant
         session or a tintin command.

         Without an argument #session shows the currently defined sessions.

         If you have more than one session, you can use the following commands:
         #session {-|+|number}:  Switches between sessions.
         #{name}:  Switches to a session with the given name.
         #{name} {command}:  Executes a command with the given session without
                             changing the active session.

         The startup session is named 'gts' and can be used for relog scripts.

Example: #act {^#SESSION '%0' DIED.^} {#gts #delay 10 #ses %0 mymud.com 4321}
