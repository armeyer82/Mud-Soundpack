["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

AIE Pilot Becomes Public Enemy Number One
-----------------------------------------
Easter celebrations ended with some excitement last night, thanks to an AIE pilot blockading various planets and the mission jumpgate with debris.
"Normally the capital sectors and Sector 12 can't be blockaded," explains Phil Halterman, who was one of the original technicians assigned to work on the long-range laser project. "The long-range lasers that we use target blockades. However, it's still possible to use debris or, as we've seen in the past, ships to blockade planets, stations, and jumpgates."
The pilot in question has been identified as Cato Arenas, who has a history of firing upon alliance property in the past. High Guard Command has deployed strikers in all capital sectors, as well as sectors 12, 15, and 19. It's been confirmed that High Guard forces are now targeting any starships owned by Arenas.
"We've tried almost everything else we can think of," says a High Guard representative who wishes to remain anonymous. "He's been jailed multiple times for past offenses. His ability to submit a specialty starship application has been revoked, and the insurance companies won't have anything to do with him either. Quite frankly, we're sick of dealing with him. So it's come to this. We're after his ships now, and we've also revoked his ability to participate in combat missions."
It's unclear what will happen next, but we can only hop
00:31 e that Mr. Arenas will see the error of his ways.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also 
21:18 see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, a translucent architectural design simulator, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, Kissy the droid, a hologram of a beach sunset projected on one wall, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, Kitcat the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
