00:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

00:25 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

00:25 There are no ships here.

00:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

00:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

00:26 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

00:26 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:26 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

00:28 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Sure. I don't mind trading off."

00:28 You peer north and see...

00:28 ["Hi-Hat" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see Karen Terese here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

00:29 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:29 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Hi-Hat" has launched from Rolukssica.

00:29 #$#soundpack social | eat | male

00:29 Daryk Karlsen's voice comes over the intercom, saying through a mouthful of food, "Come on!"

00:29 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:29 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:30 ["Hi-Hat" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see Daryk Karlsen here.
You can go south and out.

00:30 You peer east and see...

00:30 ["Hi-Hat" Weapons Room 2]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

00:30 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:30 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:30 Amanda Lynn's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "if you clog my control panels with crumbs again..."

00:30 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Hi-Hat" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

00:30 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:30 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:30 Daryk Karlsen's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "new pilot run number 3. Let's do this!"

00:30 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:30 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:30 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

01:56 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

01:56 The starship must be in space.

01:56 The computer announces, "A starship and a space station have been detected in the sector."

01:56 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:56 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

01:56 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:56 The three-person voyager "Antepasto" has docked with Jump Hub Station.

01:56 Invalid selection.

01:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:56 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:57 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:57 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:57 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:57 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:57 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "Jump complete."

01:57 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Surgyria.

01:57 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:57 There are no ships here.

01:58 The computer reports the starship is headed for Surgyria (1, 2, 3). The computer estimates approximately 12 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

01:58 You begin the landing sequence.

01:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:58 You peer out and see...

01:58 [Surgyria; Landing Pavilion]
Outside the raised metal platform reserved for the heavy starship traffic, sparkling blue and green tiles reflect back the long florescent lights set into the high ceiling of this enormous pavilion. Busy facilities ring the entirety of the space with ornate archways rather than doors leading into them. The bland beige walls and support columns have been decorated with flashy advertisements for the latest and greatest body alterations.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

02:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

02:06 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Estimesta", the one-person expediter "Autumn Breeze", and the one-person expediter "Dragon Heart" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid,
02:06  Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid the droid, Carmine the droid, Groot the droid, Chi the droid, Michae the droid, Andreas the droid, JessiePops the droid, Kaiti the droid, Christifer the droid, Arielabear the droid, and Bethan the droid here.
You can go north, east, southeast, southwest, west, and down.

02:07 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:07 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

02:07 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:07 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:07 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:07 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:07 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:07 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

02:07 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:07 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

02:07 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Planets: (4, 4, 7)

Space Stations: (15, 6, 4), (10, 14, 9), (9, 13, 9), (10, 13, 9), (11, 13, 9), and (10, 12, 9)
Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (8, 1, 5)

02:07 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:07 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:07 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

02:07 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:07 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

02:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:07 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

02:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

12:28 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:28 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

12:28 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:28 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:28 There are no ships here.

12:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:28 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

12:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:28 The ship must be in space to do that.

12:28 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:28 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

12:28 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:28 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:28 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:28 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:28 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:29 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:29 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:34 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Alliances
--------------------------------------------------
Commonwealth of Free Spirits (Commonwealth)
The Commonwealth is an alliance of people who prefer peace over violence, though they will not hesitate to use violence if it is absolutely necessary. While they are not as advanced as Hale, the Commonwealth has produced a number of impressive technological devices, including a layer of armor that is capable of absorbing partial laser blasts and converting them to energy for the starship's systems. In present times, however, a group within the Commonwealth has begun to use intimidation and violence to accomplish their goals, leading some to believe that the alliance as a whole has shifted it's beliefs, though this is a false assumption.

The Hale Collective (Hale)
The Hale Collective is an alliance devoted solely to scientific endeavors, which obviously puts them well ahead of the other alliances in terms of specialty technology. It is not uncommon for a Hale starship to do something completely unexpected, such as disappearing from sensors or traveling great distances in extremely short amounts of time. It's even rumored that Hale scientists have developed what is called a chaos bolt, which witnesses claim wreaks havoc on a starship's systems. While the existance of a chaos bolt has not been proven, there is no doubt that Hale technology makes the alliance rather formidable.

Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists
12:35  (AIE)
The AIE is most well known for its discovery of Miriani, the first planet to be colonized by humans. Members of the AIE are explorers at heart, often taking starships into uncharted space with no specific destination in mind, enjoying the freedom that comes from traveling to distant parts of the galaxy.

12:36 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

12:53 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

12:53 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a compact transparent Lore computer, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, and a black stun armor storage bag.

12:53 You are carrying a droid remote titled "Empanda" in your left hand and a droid remote titled "Rolukssica" in your right hand.

12:55 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:55 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:55 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:55 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:55 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:55 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:55 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:55 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:55 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:55 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:55 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

12:55 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:55 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:55 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:55 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

12:55 I don't understand that.

12:55 The ship must be in MANUAL mode.

12:55 There are no ships here.

12:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:56 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

12:56 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:56 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:58 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

12:58 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

12:58 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

12:58 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:58 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

12:58 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

12:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

12:58 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:49 ["Sting Ray" Control Room]
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You can go down and out.

14:13 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

Agreed.
I know there is a gag option, and I know some pilots use the things as cameras, but I can't imagine space port workers would want a bunch of droids just standing around adding crowd to the space.

Since I sincerely doubt pregnancy verbiage will ever be removed, I suggest the following adjustments to make it more realistic, because why not?

* Vomiting should actually cover your character (or clothing) in vomit.
* Moving around in later stages of pregnancy should incur roundtime.
* Lifting large objects such as furniture should incur roundtime.
* You should receive very random and disturbing messages about having urges to eat food. Like, you know, pickles. Or ice cream.
* Being hurled to the ground while going through a wormhole should give you annoying messages about landing on the baby and potentially causing damage.
* Since babies aren't allowed on missions already, it makes sense that sensors would detect the secondary lifeform inside of you and deny access to the jumpgate. Pregnant people in the mid-to-late stages of birth should not be able to go on missions.

Also, I think they should have a chance to suffer from hemroids, which causes stun time if you're sitting for too long. Time to turn up the heat.

As much as I think pregnancy need to be modified, i disagree with some of these.
First, surely mothers are sanitary enough to not be covered in voit. I do think maybe a warning should be issed to the mother that she has to vomit, and she must use a toilet quickly. if not, she could be covered in vomit.
Second, falling down actually does have very little impact for the baby. I forgot why though. Studied in child psych though.
Third, I do agree that mothers shouldn't be able to do much in the latter stages of pregnancy, but it also sems we have enough of that going around.
That's all i have so far.

You can auction properties and tradesman items. So why not starships?
Make sure that the starship is on the landing pad of Pax, then auction it. Showing its id would show the upgrade status.

From what I've heard, it's not the fact that one has fallen
rather, it is the way one falls. I think this may be a bit difficult to pull off but it's like anything. If someone falls a certain way it can damage something. It just matters how it happens. Also there is the fact of going into labor earlier than expected. My sister-in-law had that when she was pregnant with her first child last year and had to be medicated, if I remember correctly. But it depends on the situation. I hope this makes sense. Also, on the subject of pregnancies and the number of kids, I feel as though one should be able to have up to 10 kids. Yes, 10 kids is a lot, but why not make it hard for them? Children are not easy to take care of in real life either. I know a family with 12 kids, and that must have been a lot. Anyway, I hope my hopeless and unorganized ramblings did something for someone in regards to ideas.

Getting a sex change on Surgyria should not allow you to change your age. Name and appearance are fine, but getting a sex change does not automatically make you younger or older.

sorry but I feel 3 kids is the max, those who have many do it over a decade not over several months. and those who have many at once like 4 or more are rare.

As I have noticed while travelling around, certain planets and space stations seem to have a lot of droids just left on the landing pad. This can really clutter output and can delay finding something specific.
It would be great if after a set length of time droids could be moved to a droid storage facility such as the one on Miriani.

Agreed.
I know there is a gag option, and I know some pilots use the things as cameras, but I can't imagine space port workers would want a bunch of droids just standing around adding crowd to the space.

14:28 Last ten announcements:
[03/23/17 - 4:21 p.m.] Announcement: US Congress is taking a sledgehammer to the last vestiges of privacy we have left. This morning, the Senate elected to remove some of the only remaining laws that protect consumer privacy on the internet with a 50-48 vote. These laws dictate that internet service providers must receive consent from their customers before sharing or selling your web browsing data and other personal information to advertisers or other companies. Without these laws, you do not need to give your approval before ISPs sell your information. Furthermore, the Senate today used its power under the Congressional Review Act to ensure that the FCC rulemaking "shall have no force or effect" and to prevent the FCC from issuing similar regulations in the future. The House must vote on the measure before these laws are eliminated, and the President could also issue a veto. However, it's time to start considering your online safety. Visit https://www.letsgetsafe.org to learn more information about your internet safety and privacy, as well as start taking action.
[04/13/17 - 11:05 p.m.] Announcement: The annual Easter egg hunt has commenced! You can retrieve an Easter basket on Jump Hub Station. Fill it with eggs and, once Easter is over, the person who has collected the most eggs will win a fabulous prize. You can see the current rankings by typing @TOP-EGGS. Good luck!
[04/16/17 - 3:21 a.m.] Announcement: The 'Your Obligation' section of POLICY 4 has been updated with new material regarding accusations of cheating or bug abuse. Please review it as soon as possible.
[04/25/17 - 2:23 p.m.] Announcement: As a quick reminder, using the tradesman certificate marketplace to pay another player for an in character event is strictly prohibited. Furthermore, using tradesman certificates as bartering chips is also completely forbidden. If you are doing this or considering doing this, please do not. Thank you.
[05/09/17 - 11:26 a.m.] Announcement: As mentioned in message board post 87240, our IP address is going to change today after a brief shutdown. I won't go into details about the DNS situation (see OOC / Announcements for that), but suffice it to say that if you can't reconnect within an hour after shutdown, try temporarily replacing 'toastsoft.net' with 'miriani.hopto.org'. 
[05/14/17 - 9:11 a.m.] Announcement: Everyone who participated in the invasion has been awarded points and credits. ASSIST if you didn't get yours!
[05/23/17 - 3:09 p.m.] Announcement: Atmospheric salvaging has been temporarily disabled for upcoming rebalancing. It will be back soon.
[05/23/17 - 4:34 p.m.] Announcement: Atmospheric salvaging has been reenabled, with some caveats! See board post 87455 for more information.
[05/29/17 - 4:29 p.m.] Announcement: A reminder that when you give tradesman items to people, you may wish to transfer them. Otherwise, when you ret
14:28 rieve your tradesman items, any items you've given to other people without transferring will come back to you and cause the poor, unfortunate people to be confused.
[06/18/17 - 3:53 p.m.] Announcement: Happy Father's Day to all of the fatherly individuals out there! Enjoy yourselves, relax, and most importantly be reassured that your daddish efforts don't go unnoticed.
End of announcements.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

14:55 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

14:55 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

14:55 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has initiated an intrasector slip.

14:55 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:55 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:55 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

14:55 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:55 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:55 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:55 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

14:55 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

14:55 You press a large yellow button.

14:55 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to yellow.
You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

15:13 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

15:13 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

15:17 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

[Newbie] Justice Smith: Is there any other way of making combat points than doing combat missions like ground combat?

15:40 [Newbie] Carrie Reid: There are advanced missions, but you have to do those with people.

15:40 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Although out of locals combat with Praelor will get you tiny amounts of combat points.

15:42 [Newbie] Will Carter: It's also worth pointing out that some things that require combat points can also be had via industrial dispensation. Check the POINTS command in the store to see if you're eligible for that. Also check OOC / Announcements (or GOTO 84469 in your board reader) to read about that.

15:42 [Newbie] Justice Smith: So are the training combat missions meant to be relatively simple? Last I tried I had to face 2 ships by myself so any tips on dealing with multiple targets?

Subject: Industrial Dispensation

Reference: 84469   |   Votes: 0  /  0
-------------------------------------------
We've boasted for a long time that you can play the game as you wish, choosing to be a wayward vagabond, a ruthless warlord, or anything in between. But the mechanics haven't supported that as well as they could. For instance, an upgraded relativity drive benefits both the vagabond and the ruthless warlord, but you still need to war to obtain it! So to help offset that discrepancy a bit, we're introducing industrial dispensation.

What does it mean? Basically, instead of requiring combat points, certain things will instead accept your experience with aiding in the economic development of the alliances and related industries. What does THAT mean? It means they will look at your points in salvaging, asteroid hauling, trading, and things of that nature to see if you've done enough to offset the combat point requirement. Note that this is not a new point category, nor is it just adding all of those points together, so there is no set number to compare against. Instead, the new POINTS command will help you!

When available, special industrial dispensation is indicated in the POINTS command. If you don't have a high enough rating, the eligibility column will show the word 'no' followed by a number. This number is your dispensation rating, which is determined by how much experience you have in industrial tasks relative to the requirements for that particular item. Don't know what that means? You don't really need to. The numbers range from 0 to 9. 0 means you have no experience in the area of industrial activity (relative to the requirements of the particular item or upgrade) and 9 means you're just about there. When your rating is high enough, the eligibility column will switch to the word 'yes' with an asterisk, indicating that you don't have sufficient combat points but you do have a high enough dispensation rating to purchase the item or upgrade. Note that the dispensation rating will only appear after you have sufficient license points.

So, in a nutshell: If you don't have enough combat points, you may still be eligible for an upgrade or item. Check the POINTS command. If you see a number in the eligibility column, that's how close you are to getting your item without combat points. The range is 0-9, with higher being better. Sal sal sal (or whatever) until you see a YES in the column!

As of this writing, the following things are eligible for dispensation:

	Relativity Drive Enhancements
	Starship Drive Engagement Matrix
	Slip Drive Optimization
	Subwarp Drive Optimization
	Replacement Wormhole Drive
	Replacement Bardenium Cannon
	Replacement Laser Turret
	
15:43 Replacement Sensor Array
	Additional Storage Room
	Remove Additional Storage Room
	Level Two Storage Upgrade

We hope this will give people with different playing styles the freedom they need to not feel left behind. If you have any suggestions, complaints, praise, items or upgrades to add, or anything at all (we're so desperate for human contact), don't hesitate to post a message in any of your conveniently located message board categories! And as always... REPORT if you find anything unusual, embarrassing, broken, or otherwise unsavory.

Thanks!

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft.

18:58 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go down and out.

20:33 ["Snuggle Bug" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.

23:44 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

23:44 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:44 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

23:44 There are no ships here.

23:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:44 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:44 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

23:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

23:44 You'll have better results scanning in space.

23:44 There is nothing to see.

23:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

Current Coordinates: (16, 15, 8)

23:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

23:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:45 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

23:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

23:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:45 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:45 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

23:45 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:45 The ship needs to be in space to move.

23:45 You must stand up first.

23:45 You must stand up first.

23:45 You stand up.

23:45 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.
