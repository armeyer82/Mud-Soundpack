00:35 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

00:35 From a thick white leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a red flight control scanner announce, "Decker Trisolar Catapult Array to Infinitus Astrum flight control, a blue exclamation mark just disappeared from my starmap. A Praelor starship has died."

00:35 You peer out and see...

00:35 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

01:24 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

01:24 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

01:24 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the five-person transverser "Stellar Glider" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid the droid, Carmine the droid, Groot the droid, Chi the droid,

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

02:37 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:37 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:37 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:37 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:37 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:37 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:37 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

02:37 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:37 The ship must be in space to do that.

02:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:37 [General Communication] Lili Shannon transmits, "On my way."

02:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

02:37 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:37 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:37 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:37 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:37 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

02:37 The one-person expediter "Shimmering Light" has jumped into the sector.

02:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

02:38 [General Communication] Lili Shannon transmits, "Bay?"

02:38 [General Communication] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "I'll come help as well."

02:39 [General Communication] Alayna Cantrell transmits, "Alpha."

02:39 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:39 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

02:39 You must stand up first.

02:39 You stand up.

03:26 You peer out and see...

03:26 [Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay]
Despite not being the true center of the station the docking bay is undoubtedly the main hub of activity. Countless numbers of pilots as well as people seeking transportation on a ship come and go, walking up stairs that lead to gangways that are out of the way of taxiing starships. Looking up you can see many gangways that form a tangled web which appears to climb forever. Almost constantly the sound of the bay doors opening and closing can be heard, allowing a starship to enter or leave the station.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the five-person transverser "Astraeus' Odyssey" and the five-person transverser "Estimesta" landed here.
You see a shiny silver trashcan, Eram the droid, Freckles the droid, Flis the droid, Robbie the droid, RightThen the droid, a glowing green security drone, a translucent green security drone, Lurker the droid, Kimberly the droid, Carlos the droid, Fog the droid, an Easter basket dispenser, a gleaming gray medical drone, a gleaming red medical drone, a gleaming gray security drone, two gleaming black security drones, two gleaming red security drones, a gleaming black medical drone, and a gleaming blue security drone here.

04:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

04:09 Olivia Cantrell's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "now where to?"

04:09 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

04:09 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

04:09 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

04:09 From a thick white leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a red flight control scanner announce, "ISC Starship Construction Depot Delta to Venitia flight control, just pushed my starmap button and see one less Praelor starship flying around. I need a raise."

04:10 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

04:10 With no warning, the gravity in the room increases, pinning you to the floor. It sounds like the ship's computer is saying something, but you can't make the exact message out in the static.

04:10 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

04:10 With an abrupt and unexplainable popping sound, the gravity in the room fails entirely. You begin to feel the effects of weightlessness as the gravity plating returns to normal levels. You fall to the ground with an uncomfortable thud.

04:10 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

04:10 As the starship lurches forward ever so slightly, your ears pop. You glance out the window and see that it has been restored to nominal luminocity and the sector has changed.

04:10 You need to stand up first.

04:10 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Great job everyone."

04:10 You stand up.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

06:52 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

  * Alliances that are on hostile terms with any other alliances (either full war or declaration of hostility) will now have their capital planet's long-range laser disabled. This means that capital sectors can be interdicted, blockaded, or otherwise disrupted if any sort of hostility is in effect.
  * Fixed a bug that would allow players to propose a treaty for a military alliance, even if there were no active hostilities between the three alliances.

14:22 Last ten announcements:
[03/22/17 - 4:24 p.m.] Announcement: Hello! It's that time again: the United States Congress is attempting to overturn laws set in effect to protect your internet privacy by using the Congressional Review Act. In a nutshell, this means that internet service providers in the USA could sell any information they glean about you to the highest bidder. The Congressional Review Act not only allows Congress to overturn rules with a simple majority vote, but it also prevents the agency from issuing the same regulation in the future. If this happens, it's the beginning of the end of digital privacy. This isnt just your browsing history or cookies. It's geolocation data, financial info, passwords, health info, even your Social Security Number. Anything you do, any data you enter, any online video you watch, any email you write. Your ISP could store it all and sell it for their own profit if Congress throws out the FCC rulings. You should call your senators today to protest this action. For more information, please visit https://www.savebroadbandprivacy.org/ and don't forget to sign the petition. Thank you!
[03/23/17 - 4:21 p.m.] Announcement: US Congress is taking a sledgehammer to the last vestiges of privacy we have left. This morning, the Senate elected to remove some of the only remaining laws that protect consumer privacy on the internet with a 50-48 vote. These laws dictate that internet service providers must receive consent from their customers before sharing or selling your web browsing data and other personal information to advertisers or other companies. Without these laws, you do not need to give your approval before ISPs sell your information. Furthermore, the Senate today used its power under the Congressional Review Act to ensure that the FCC rulemaking "shall have no force or effect" and to prevent the FCC from issuing similar regulations in the future.

Subject: Atmospheric Salvager Rebalancing with a Side of Cheesecake
Sender: Victor

Reference: 87455   |   Votes: +10/ -9
-------------------------------------------
There have been a few fundamental changes to how atmospheric salvagers work. After reconsideration, we acknowledge that this activity had minimal risks for significant gain. As such, you are now required to keep your starship in space and within one unit of the planet before launching an atmospheric salvager. This is similar to the way gas and aquatic salvagers have always worked. To return to your ship, you should move up (hit +), rather than down. To move further into the atmosphere, move down (hit -).

Crashing an atmospheric salvager will now return you to your starship's storage room, rather than the planet's surface. Launching or returning any form of salvager will also announce what's happening sector-wide to other ships that might be present. Finally, salvagers will be notified when another ship locks on the mothership while they're launched. They'll also be alerted when the mothership's status changes to purple, or if it's been fired on.

Please report any wonkiness that occurs!

14:24 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

14:24 You stand up.

14:24 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

14:24 You peer out and see...

14:24 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

14:32 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The ten-person battlecruiser "Genocide" has left the sector.

14:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

14:33 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

14:33 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid the droid, Carmine the droid, Groot the droid, Chi the droid, Micha

You can go north, east, southeast, southwest, west, and down.

14:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Acrylon.

14:34 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:34 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:34 You're already sitting down.

14:34 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:34 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

14:34 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

14:34 The ship must be in space to do that.

14:34 The computer announces, "A starship has been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:34 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:34 Select a ship:

14:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

14:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

14:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

14:34 [Private | Abigail Starns] Abigail Starns transmits, "what's up?"

14:34 [Private | Abigail Starns] You transmit, "Just saying hi."

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
