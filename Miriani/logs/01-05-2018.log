01:40 The brown sand of an empty beach ends at the lapping edge of a calm, flat ocean, Above, the sky is on fire with the oranges and reds of sunset. At the horizon, a golden sun has mostly sunk out of sight, leaving a wedge of fading light to fall across the rolling waves. The water ebbs and flows from the beach, the gentle waves ending in white foam which sprays up and dissipates in the air. Reflecting the fiery colors of the sunset, the vast expanse of water gently ripples in the distance.

12:21 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

12:21 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I know but you left pretty early so was just curious that's all."

12:21 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Matrix of Reality" powered down here.
You see the eight-person gunship "Pirate's Grotto", the three-person heliogaster "Aqueous Transmission", and the one-person expediter "Distance Runner" landed here.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit t

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Public Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.

She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a low-cut transparent fuchsia silk halter top which has a sweetheart neck and is covered in tiny diamonds over a light yellow lace underwire bra. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of white capris over a pair of light yellow lace bikini underwear. She is wearing a pair of sexy clear wedge sandals with open-toes and with little purple jewels on the straps on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a violet spacesuit jet, a pink flight control scanner, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an ameth

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

14:29 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a dark blue suede sofa, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and an internal stun turret here.

15:23 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:23 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:24 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:24 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:24 You're already sitting down.

15:24 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

15:24 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:24 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

15:24 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:24 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

15:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:24 Kitty Mars presses a series of buttons on a sensor control board.

15:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:24 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:24 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

15:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

15:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:24 You smile at Kitty Mars.

15:24 Kitty Mars beams happily at you.

> (Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Living Room) (Docking Bay) You notice a bright flash of light in the distance; a starship must be coming in to dock.

16:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

We fly starships as a key part of the game, yet, starships have nothing anywhere that discribes how they look from the outside. We used to, Aski art and the like, but now there is nothing. And most of those were for older starships. I personally would really like to know what my fighter looks like, or my freighter, or my destroyer. I would personally like to know where all my turrets are. Where are my sensors? Where is my wormhole drive? What is the shape of my hull? Thoughts?

Unfortunately, this will never be done. External cameras are for the battlecruiser and eviscerator only. You'll have to use a droid in other cases.

Is it possible that we could have the options to design our custom landing messages for when someone lands at our space sation, moon or planet? Also, can we have the ability to describe what the actual station, moon and or planet looks like? So if I was to space walk and take a picture of the structure, I would see more than just, "you see nothing special". Thanks in advance.

I have to say, I am not thrilled with some of the things I saw on this thread. Yes, I was very close to the man behind the character, but I also watched my sister fall to pieces over the man she loved. "Rest in peace, not in pieces?" Not appropriate. Also, I personally think a memorial service would be very nice for the grieving. Even though his rp character did not die, the person behind said character did. This memorial service would be to show that his friends and family from all over the world are paying respect. I feel like more and more every day, gamers are forgetting that there are actually people behind the keyboards, and a lot of times, when something happens to a player, I.E, hospital stay, death in the family, or marriage and subsequent honeymoon, there Character is effected because they are busy, so obviously, their character will not be active.
What I'm basically saying, is that, one, who ever said the "not in pieces," be very careful how you use that phrase. It to me, was very hurtful, and to some may be more so. Just be careful. and if his friends want to organize a memorial, don't make snide comments please. Kyle Cunningham was such a good man. His hard 
21:32 "fuck the world" exterior was just a shield for one of the largest and most caring/loving hearts I have ever known. His death does teach us that "living the moment," is not as much of a cliche as it sounds. I know some people will want to use humor to vent their emotions, and as one of those people, I say this. if you want to say something to make yourself and others laugh, think of a funny memory you have of him. even those of you who may not have necessarily known him, would roll on the floor with some of the stories that others could tell about him.
Anyway, to wrap this up, be careful with those who grieve. they are already hurting enough, don't make it worse by being heartless.
Rest in Peace, Kyle Cunningham, AKA, Alissandra. You will be missed for the duration of many lives. Even though you and I didn't really know each other on a 1 to 1 basis, Nothing will replace the place you had in my life. And rest assured, you are still making us laugh our asses off!

There are many people who miss him and grieve for kyle in their own way and maybe a joking comment is just someone's way of doing just that.
also an in game service for him wouldn't make any sense and would also be against policy since you can't use a player in an rp without their permission.
I think the best thing to say is just alysandra has retired and leave it at that. it would rub too many the wrong way for a number of reasons.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to say that the player behind Alissandra Ivonov's character has died on December 18, 2017 due to a diabetic fit. He passed in his sleep. He was nineteen years old. While I'm sure there were those of us who didn't know the person behind the player well, I'm also sure there were many more of us who did. I knew him extremely well, and I have this to say. To morn the death of someone you know and care about is perfectly normal. It is a painful, long process. But that process
need not be embarked upon alone. We must come together
to morn, but more importantly to reflect. To remember the good times, the rp, the laughs. We must take all that we've experienced and learn from it, for
you never know when someone may be lost. The death of someone so young teaches us that we must make the most of every day. We must say what needs to be
said, do what needs to be done, sooner rather than later. Because if we don't, we may never be able to the next day. Let this young man's death serve not
only as a cause to reflect upon ourselves, but to change ourselves. Let this be a rallying cry for each one of us to improve who we are as people, how
we treat o
21:34 thers. Let this serve as a reminder that who we are is influenced by our experiences, and those around us. But finally, let this be a lesson
to all of us to make the most of what we have, in the time we are given. Because you never know when that time may come to an end. Thank you.
