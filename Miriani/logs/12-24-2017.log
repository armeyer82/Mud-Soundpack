[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

[Ceridwen; Formal Lounge] (indoors)
Gleaming marble of imperial blue makes up the walls and floor, tiles of various shades of greens and purples inlaid at random intervals, light bouncing between them in a chaotic spray of color. Unlike the lower levels, an oriental rug has been laid in the center of the room serving as a stage for a number of seating arrangements. A Chaise longue is positioned against each wall of the room, while tuffets and deeply cushioned armchairs are placed more towards the center. Carpeted corridors spill from each corner of the parlor leading deeper into the structure. There is a button here to summon the lift. You see a light pink frame containing a canvas titled "Just Before Teatime" and a large glass mantel clock hanging on the wall.
You see a highly polished round marble buffet table with goldleaf around the edge, an elegant snow white satin divan ringed by a flowing skirt of antique lace, two comfortable dark blue easy chairs, two deep purple rose petal-patterned satin poufs, a deep purple ovular area rug, a festive Christmas tree, a silver star-shaped crystal candy dish embedded with tiny glittering diamonds, a silver crystal decanter embedded with tiny glittering diamonds, An elegantly tiered chocolate fountain, an automated chrome and glass bar, and Stfu the droid here.

11:45 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

11:45 You begin the launch sequence.

11:45 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

11:45 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

11:45 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

11:45 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

11:45 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

11:45 You are carrying nothing.

11:45 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

11:45 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

11:46 #$#soundpack_pong

11:46 #$#soundpack_lag 131

11:46 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

11:46 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

11:46 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

11:46 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

11:46 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

11:46 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

11:46 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

11:46 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

11:46 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

11:46 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

11:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

11:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

11:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

11:46 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Apartment 26860; Foyer.

11:46 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

11:46 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table.

You see three translucent red security drones and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, southeast, and down.

12:01 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

12:01 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

12:01 I don't understand that ("chair" is an ambiguous name).

12:01 You must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

12:01 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:01 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:01 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:01 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:01 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:02 #$#soundpack_pong

12:02 #$#soundpack_lag 108

12:02 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:02 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:02 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:02 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:02 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:02 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:02 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 6, 4."

12:02 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:02 There are no ships here.

12:02 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:02 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:02 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels orient themselves toward a star.

12:02 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:02 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:02 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:02 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at 51 Pegasi b; Balloonzia Circle Landing Pad. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertain

This large docking bay is a tangled mess of starships, drones, workers, and supplies.

Harassed looking workers run to and fro, checking cargo containers or helping angry pilots with their docking situations. A thin line of yellow tape leads to the southwest through a large doorway.

Connecting directly to the docking bay, it's obvious that space was at a premium when this station was constructed.

The ceiling of this room is much larger than that of a typical station room in order to accomodate the massive excavator units lined against the wall, each unit resembling a soldier standing at attention. Harsh lights shine brightly on the units, casting elongated shadows up the wall that reach toward the ceiling and meld with the immense blackness at the top. Several racks in the room hold brightly colored repair kits, tightly wound cabling, collapsed tubing, and various repair tools in boxes or on special mounts. Other pieces of squat, heavy machinery are on display here, some displaying strips of caution tape and others nothing more than bare metal. A large door in the back accommodates the upgrade center where vehicle bays and ramps are installed into starships and heavy equipment is loaded.

Though the walls have been painted a pale shade of blue, they have begun to peal in places, and the overall effect is one of neglect.

This small, cramped room is stacked from ceiling to floor with tall antennas, seemingly swaying through the air like massive, iron tentacles. A hologram on the west wall displays several pilots assembled in a control room, talking into their communicators. In the foreground, another person can be seen, standing on some rocky surface, speaking into a communicator. The starship appears to be headed through space on a reverse route to this very same celestial body. A small notice below reads, "STARSHIP PRIVATE COMMUNICATION RELAYS! NEVER STRAND YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN!" On the opposite wall, a starship can be seen, seemingly receiving bardenium from a nearby mining tower. Behind the counter, a perfectly human female clerk smiles attractively, waving to the menu posted on the back wall, though it seems obvious that one wouldn't need it to know what's for sale here.

Asteroid Mining
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Asteroid mining is an industrial activity that involves setting up mining equipment in order to extract the valuable resources that an asteroid holds. Unlike asteroid hauling, which is accomplished by anchoring a starship to an asteroid and towing it to a collection station, asteroid mining takes place on enormous asteroids that are unable to be towed by starship. This makes them ideal for permanent mining establishments.

  Requirements
  * A starship capable of taking you into uncharted space.
  * A vehicle docking bay.
  * A vehicle docking bay ramp.
  * An asteroid rover.
  * Two asteroid stabilizers.
  * Excavators.
  * Storage towers.
  * At least one cardenium reactor.
  * A collection of power cables.
  * A collection of tubing.
  * A repair kit.
  * Replacement parts.
  * A mineral scanner.

  Locating a Suitable Asteroid
First you'll need to locate an enormous asteroid. The procedure here is similar to asteroid hauling; you fly into uncharted space until you find an asteroid. SCAN it and, if it's classified as enormous, you're set. If not, continue searching until you find one. It's worth noting that enormous asteroids are typically located several lightyears away from the inhabited sectors, so you may have to travel farther than you would on a normal asteroid haul.

It's also important to note the composition o
12:55 f the asteroid that you scan. If you're interested in refining weapons-grade bardenium, you'll want to locate an asteroid rich in bardenium. If you're interested in cornering the market on fuel, an asteroid rich in cardenium will behoove you. Keep an eye on the materials necessary to build what you need and select an appropriate asteroid.

  Selecting a Site for your Mine
Once you've landed on your asteroid, you'll want to step outside and do some surveying. You'll need a mineral scanner for this step.

When you first exit your ship, type USE MINERAL to use your mineral scanner. You'll be presented with a map displaying all of the detectable pockets of mineral in the scanner's range, along with a rundown of the appropriate coordinates. Once you find a nearby source, walk to it and USE the scanner again. This time it will display the type of mineral located where you're standing.

It's a good idea to look around a bit to find which mineral pockets interest you and create a rough map in your head of how your mine will be setup. You'll want everything to be easily accessible.

  Stabilizing an Asteroid
Once you've located the minerals that you want, it's time to stabilize your asteroid so that it's safe to mine. It's important to remember that your excavators will NOT function on an asteroid that hasn't been properly stabilized.

In order to stabilize an asteroid, you will need exactly two stabilizers. Not one, not 
12:55 three, not four... two. These stabilizers must be placed at least 20 units away from each other and they must be powered.

To deploy a stabilizer, you must load it into your asteroid rover and DEPLOY it in the location that you desire. For more information on how to operate an asteroid rover, please see HELP ASTEROID ROVER.

Once you've deployed the stabilizer, you'll have to attach it to a power source. Since you can't take an attached power cable into a rover, this may require a bit of a walk. The procedure itself, however, is quite simple. You ATTACH CABLE TO STABILIZER, walk to your reactor, and ATTACH CABLE TO REACTOR.

  Tubing and Wiring
Tubing is used to connect any two pieces of equipment that may want to share materials. For this reason, you'll want to buy one length of tubing for every two pieces of equipment you want to connect. The following situations may require a length of tubing:

  * Connecting an excavator to a storage tower.
  * Connecting a storage tower to a cardenium reactor.
  * Connecting a storage tower to an asteroid rover.

Wiring is used to connect a cardenium reactor to a piece of mining equipment to supply power. You will need one length of wire for every piece of equipment that you purchase.

Once you have your tubing and wiring, you use the ATTACH command to attach them. For example, to attach a tube to a storage tower, you simply type: ATTACH TUBE TO TOWER.

To detach something that's attached to a piece of equipment, you use the DETACH command. For example, to remove the tubing we attached earlier, type: DETACH TOWER. You will be presented with a menu of things to detach, which will include (if applicable) what the thing is attached to on the other end so that you know what you're detaching.

To see what a particular piece of equipment is attached to, you use the CONNECTIONS <equipment> command.

  Deploying Excavators
Excavators are the machines that do all of the hard work in your mine. They're responsible for actually digging up the materials that you want and transferring them to the storage towers.

To deploy an excavator, make sure you're standing on a mineral pocket that you want by typing USE MINERAL. Once you're sure, return to your asteroid rover and type DEPLOY. Select the excavator from the list and wait for it to be deployed. NOTE: Make 100% certain that you've set a FREQUENCY in your rover's control room before you deploy anything. See HELP ASTEROID ROVER for more details.

Now step outside of your rover and ATTACH a POWER cable to the EXCAVATOR. Once that's done, you'll want to take a brisk walk to your cardenium reactor and ATTACH the cable to it. This will power your excavator.

The final step is to connect your excavator to a storage tower.

  Deploying Storage Towers
The procedure for deploying a storage tower is mostly the same as everything else. You'll want to DEPLOY it from a rover control room, attach a power cable to it, and attach the power cable to a reactor.

Once that's done, you'll need to grab a length of tubing and ATTACH it to your storage tower. Now you'll need to take a brisk walk to an excavator and ATTACH the tube to it.

It's important to note that storage towers can only contain a single type of material at any given time. If your tower contains cardenium and your excavator is mining bardenium, the bardenium it mines will simply be discarded. To empty a storage tower, please see the section on emptying a storage tower.

  Emptying a Storage Tower
There are two methods available for emptying storage towers. One wastes everything inside, while the other transfers it to safety.

Method 1 - Transferring
  1.) ATTACH one end of a length of tubing to the storage tower and the other to an asteroid rover.
  2.) Enter the rover and type TRANSFER.

Method 2 - Dumping
  1.) Type DUMP TOWER.

  Recharging Your Reactor
As you operate your mine, you'll quickly come to realize that your reactor's internal battery is not very large and you'll want to replenish it. Fortunately, the easiest way to do this is by introducing fuel into the equation.

Cardenium reactors are fueled by, you guessed it, cardenium. It's important to either have a surplus of cardenium stored in your ship or to find an asteroid where you can mine it. The easiest option, though perhaps not the safest, is to mine the cardenium directly and pump it into the reactor.

Method 1: From ship to reactor
  1.) Purchase cardenium from another pilot or a trading center.
  2.) DOCK your asteroid rover in your ship's vehicle bay.
  3.) Type TRANSFER in the rover control room.
  4.) Choose the option to transfer cargo from the ship to the rover.
  5.) LAUNCH the rover and navigate to your cardenium reactor.
  6.) Step outside and ATTACH a tube to the reactor and to the rover.
  7.) Enter your rover and TRANSFER again. It should recognize the reactor and begin the fuel transfer.

Method 2: Cardenium mining
  1.) Ensure that your mine is producing and storing cardenium.
  2.) Attach one end of a tube to the storage tower containing cardenium and the other end to your reactor.

  Linking Droids to Communication Towers
Droids can be an invaluable resource when it comes to asteroid mining. With the additional of a communication uplink card, droids can link with a communication tower in your mine and relay important information to you as long as you and the droid are within the tower's broadcast range.

The first thing you'll want to do is purchase a communication uplink card for your droid. 

The next thing you'll want to do is establish a frequency to use for your communications. If you choose a frequency that's already in use and within range, you may receive updates for a mine that's not yours. To set y
12:55 our own frequency, type FREQUENCY in your rover control room before deploying a communication tower. NOTE: It's very important to set the frequency in your rover BEFORE you deploy any equipment. If you neglect to do so, the frequency of the tower may not match the frequency the equipment is broadcasting on.

Finally, walk your droid to the communication tower and type USE TOWER. Your droid will now be linked to the tower. You can instruct your droid to inform you of its current uplink status, as well as receive the last few transmissions, by saying: Droid name, uplink. If you wish to clear the uplink buffer, say: Droid name, uplink clear.

  Repairing Damaged Components
Almost all of the equipment used in asteroid mining will break down at one point or another. For this reason, repair kits are sold that will contain a number of useful items for maintaining equipment.

Due to the breadth of repairs available, this information has been put into a repair manual that you will find in your repair kit.

  Miscellaneous Warnings
It's best to keep an eye on your equipment. You may not get warnings until things are in really bad shape.

It's also best to remember that mining cardenium and bardenium could be very dangerous. These are both highly combustible substances.

13:00 Solar Panels
--------------------------------------------------
Land-based solar panels can be constructed on an asteroid using a solar panel construction facility. When used in conjunction with a recharging platform (which can, as the name implied, be constructed on an asteroid with a recharging platform construction facility), one or more starships can be slowly recharged on the surface of an asteroid while mining operations are underway.

Each recharging platform has connectors for up to four solar panels. The more solar panels you attach to the platform, the more total power is generated. You can see how much power is being generated, as well as how many starships are consuming that power, by attaching a diagnostic device to a recharging platform.

With constant exposure, solar panels may occasionally get particulates or other filth on their glass. The dirtier the panel is, the less power it's able to produce. You can check a solar panel's efficiency with a diagnostic device. When a solar panel is not performing at peak efficiency, you'll want to clean it. For very small jobs, a brush will suffice. However, if you want to get a lot of cleaning done in a hurry, you'll want to purchase solar panel cleaning gel. Simply squeeze some on, smear it around, and squeegee it off.

13:04 Starship Communication Relay
--------------------------------------------------
A starship communication relay is a transmitter that allows your ship to relay transmissions to authorized users up to 10 lightyears away. Essentially it's a private communication channel centered around a starship crew rather than a private organization or an alliance. The relay itself must be constructed with the asteroid mining construction facility. Once you have the upgrade installed, the following commands apply:

CHANNEL - When used in the control room, allows you to enable/disable the relay, authorize communicators, and deauthorize communicators. 
TR SHIP <message> - Transmits to the ship's private channel.

NOTE: The relay will only function within 10 lightyears of the ship.

13:06 Starship Retrofit Construction Facility
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
A starship retrofit construction facility allows you to construct a starship retrofit facility on an asteroid's surface.

  Requirements
 * An asteroid rover to deploy the facility.
 * One or more droids.

  Commands
USE: Allows you to assign a destination for the finished product as well as assigning and relieving droids.
STATUS <facility>: Displays a report of the facilities current progress.
REQUIREMENTS <facility>: Displays a list of the required materials to build a single chunk. Can be shortened to REQ.
CARGO <facility>: Displays a list of what the facility currently contains.

  Special Droid Commands
DELIVER: Instructs a droid to make another delivery attempt if it's carrying a chunk. This command is typically never used, but is useful if something goes wrong with the first delivery attempt. If a chunk delivery fails for too long, the entire project will be automatically scrapped.

  Procedure
Once the facility is deployed, you'll want to select a site to begin building the actual retrofit facility. This site can be located at any set of valid coordinates on the asteroid, provided those coordinates aren't occupied by any other piece of mining equipment. It's wise, however, to choose a location close to the retrofit construction facility to minimize transit time. To set a site, type USE FACILITY and select option 1 to change the destination.

The next thing you'll want to do is assign one or more droids to the facility. When the facility completes building a chunk, it will require a droid to deliver that chunk to the destination site and begin integrating it into the final product. The facility is capable of storing only so many completed chunks before it's full. You can see how many chunks have been queued for delivery by viewing the STATUS. It's important to note that all other droid functions will be superceded by the delivery task. To assign a droid, type USE FACILITY and choose option 2, assign droid. To restore a droid to normal function, choose option 3, relieve droid.

Once you have everything assigned, you'll want to begin transferring the raw materials to the facility. This is accomplished by ATTACHing a length of tubing to both the facility and an asteroid rover. Type TRANSFER in the rover's control room to begin the material transfer.

Once the requirements are met, the facility will begin constructing "chunks". Chunks are small building blocks that are used in the construction of a larger, more complex project. You can view the STATUS of the facility to see how many chunks have been completed and if the facility is currently working or not.

  Miscellaneous Notes
 * The facility will draw enough power to complete a chunk when it begins working. This means that if your reactor suddenly stops supplying power, the facility will still be able to complete the chunk that it's working on. However, be aware that a reactor explosion could still potentially damage or destroy the facility. Always keep your reactor maintained.
 * This facility can be loaded into a rover. The retrofit facility that it constructs, however, is a permanent structure.

Asteroid Rover
--------------------------------------------------
  Description:
Asteroid rovers are large vehicles that are used to ferry equipment from a starship to various point on an asteroid's surface. Due to the size of the vehicle, it requires a vehicle docking bay to house it, along with a ramp if you wish to dock it back in your ship when you're done using it.

  Commands:
Launch - Launches the vehicle from the vehicle bay. If you have a ramp, you can safely travel down to the asteroid surface. If not, your starship will utilize the vehicle catapult and hurl you out the side of the ship and onto the asteroid surface. That could result in injury!

Dock - Returns the rover to a vehicle bay. You must have a key to the ship that you wish to dock with. If multiple options are available, you will be prompted to choose one.

Charge - Displays how much power your vehicle has remaining. See the section on recharging below for more information on keeping your vehicle powered.

Nav - Displays your current coordinates, which can also be obtained by typing LOOK. Also, if a powered landing beacon is found, it will display the coordinates of your landing site.

Cargo - Displays what minerals or equipment you have loaded and how much more you can store.

Deploy [item] - Sets up [item] on the asteroid surface. You can specify an item name in the command or just type DEPLOY to get a list.

Retrieve - Removes an ite
13:12 m from the surface and places it back into the rover cargo area.

Repair - Repairs a damaged drill bit or antenna.

Transfer - Transfers cargo from a storage tower to the vehicle, from the vehicle to a ship, or from a ship to the vehicle.

Frequency - Automatically sets the frequency of any communication towers deployed by the vehicle. The frequency is important for ensuring the privacy of your reports.

Map [all] - The standard MAP command can be used inside the rover to view the asteroid's surface. If you specify the all argument, the entire asteroid will be mapped instead of the immediate area.

Out - Exits the vehicle.

  Vehicle Charge:
Like almost every other vehicle in the game, asteroid rovers require power to continue operating. They can get powered in one of three ways:

1.) The first is through a starship. By docking in a vehicle docking bay, your rover will receive a full battery of power.

2.) Asteroid rovers also conveniently have a cardenium generators interface. Simply LINK (or ATTACH) them to a generator and wait for it to accumulate charge.

3.) A good old charge booster! USE a booster in the control center for a quick boost to allow you to dock or reach a generator.

  Communication
The FREQUENCY command is extremely important. It establishes the base frequency that all of your equipment will operate on. Every time you DEPLOY a piece of equipment, your rover will set that equipment's 
13:12 frequency to whatever you set with the FREQUENCY command. Make sure you set it before deploying.

When you type SYSTEMS in the engineering room of a starship, you will be presented with the following options:

* Main Power - When disabled, your starship will have no power. Typing POWER in the control room will not work until main power is restored.

* Subwarp Drive - When disabled, the subwarp drive will not be utilized by NAVI or GATE and cannot be manually activated.

* Slip Drive - When disabled, the slip drive will not be utilized by NAVI or GATE and cannot be manually activated.

* Docking Bay Door - If your starship is equipped with a docking bay, no other starship can enter or exit your ship's docking bay when this is disabled. They can still dock to the docking ring of your ship.

* Holographic Avatar - If available, this will disable the usage of a holographic avatar.

* Salvage Line Launchers - When disabled, your ship will be unable to launch salvage lines, making salvaging impossible.

* Solar Panels - When disabled, the solar panels will not automatically deploy when the ship gets in range of a star.

* Laser Reflectors - The reflectors will not automatically reorient to reflect laser fire when disabled.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video 
13:25 screen, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at 51 Pegasi b; Balloonzia Circle Landing Pad.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves s

Starship Retrofit Construction Facility
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
A starship retrofit construction facility allows you to construct a starship retrofit facility on an asteroid's surface.

  Requirements
 * An asteroid rover to deploy the facility.
 * One or more droids.

  Commands
USE: Allows you to assign a destination for the finished product as well as assigning and relieving droids.
STATUS <facility>: Displays a report of the facilities current progress.
REQUIREMENTS <facility>: Displays a list of the required materials to build a single chunk. Can be shortened to REQ.
CARGO <facility>: Displays a list of what the facility currently contains.

  Special Droid Commands
DELIVER: Instructs a droid to make another delivery attempt if it's carrying a chunk. This command is typically never used, but is useful if something goes wrong with the first delivery attempt. If a chunk delivery fails for too long, the entire project will be automatically scrapped.

  Procedure
Once the facility is deployed, you'll want to select a site to begin building the actual retrofit facility. This site can be located at any set of valid coordinates on the asteroid, provided those coordinates aren't occupied by any other piece of mining equipment. It's wise, however, to choose a location close to the retrofit construction facility to minimize transit time. To set a site, type USE FACILITY
13:58  and select option 1 to change the destination.

The next thing you'll want to do is assign one or more droids to the facility. When the facility completes building a chunk, it will require a droid to deliver that chunk to the destination site and begin integrating it into the final product. The facility is capable of storing only so many completed chunks before it's full. You can see how many chunks have been queued for delivery by viewing the STATUS. It's important to note that all other droid functions will be superceded by the delivery task. To assign a droid, type USE FACILITY and choose option 2, assign droid. To restore a droid to normal function, choose option 3, relieve droid.

Once you have everything assigned, you'll want to begin transferring the raw materials to the facility. This is accomplished by ATTACHing a length of tubing to both the facility and an asteroid rover. Type TRANSFER in the rover's control room to begin the material transfer.

Once the requirements are met, the facility will begin constructing "chunks". Chunks are small building blocks that are used in the construction of a larger, more complex project. You can view the STATUS of the facility to see how many chunks have been completed and if the facility is currently working or not.

  Miscellaneous Notes
 * The facility will draw enough power to complete a chunk when it begins working. This means that if your reactor suddenly stops supplying power, the facility will still be able to complete the chunk that it's working on. However, be aware that a reactor explosion could still potentially damage or destroy the facility. Always keep your reactor maintained.
 * This facility can be loaded into a rover. The retrofit facility that it constructs, however, is a permanent structure.

14:00 Starship Communication Relay
--------------------------------------------------
A starship communication relay is a transmitter that allows your ship to relay transmissions to authorized users up to 10 lightyears away. Essentially it's a private communication channel centered around a starship crew rather than a private organization or an alliance. The relay itself must be constructed with the asteroid mining construction facility. Once you have the upgrade installed, the following commands apply:

CHANNEL - When used in the control room, allows you to enable/disable the relay, authorize communicators, and deauthorize communicators. 
TR SHIP <message> - Transmits to the ship's private channel.

NOTE: The relay will only function within 10 lightyears of the ship.

14:06 You begin the launch sequence.

14:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:06 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:06 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

14:06 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:06 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

14:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:06 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

14:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:07 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:07 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:07 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:07 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

14:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

14:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

14:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

You see nothing special. You see a tapestry depicting a blossoming apple orchard at dawn hanging on the wall.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a light blue dragon-shaped garden fountain, an extra large thick green and blue rectangular outdoor rug, a sturdy blue baby walker with a butterfly print padded seat and an assortment of toys on the attached plastic tray, a shimmering red metal horse carriage with gold wheels, a hovering sapphire blue metal spaceship with silver wheels, a fierce jet black hovercycle with attached golden bells, an orange satin-lined umbrella double stroller patterned with lions, a red furniture trolley, a hovering quadruple stroller with light yellow padded seats, and a chrome silver hovercraft here.
You can go east.

15:15 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.
You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with sev
15:15 eral shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several

17:03 As the ship descends toward the planet, the tops of the gleaming silver structures below can be seen.

17:03 Details of the structures begin to become more apparent as the ship comes closer to the planet.  The overall heart-shape of the structures can be noticed upon final approach.

17:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Keyton; Keyton Landing.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

18:35 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

18:35 The one-person space sleigh "Santa Claus is Coming to Space" has jumped into the sector.

18:35 Via general sector communication, Santa Claus is Coming to Space transmits: "HO HO HO! I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU, Tibo Beauchene! HO! HO! HO!"

18:35 The one-person space sleigh "Santa Claus is Coming to Space" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

18:35 The air suddenly gets very cold as a veritable blizzard appears in the room. You instinctively shield your eyes, and the next thing you know, Santa Claus is standing in the room!

18:35 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

18:35 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:35 Santa Claus exclaims, "HO HO HO! Merry Christmas, Tibo Beauchene!"

18:35 You cannot abort a landing or docking sequence.

18:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

18:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:35 Santa Claus gives you a plush reindeer.

18:35 Santa Claus exclaims, "Farewell to all, and to all a good morning!"

18:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:36 The air suddenly gets very cold as a veritable blizzard appears in the room. You instinctively shield your eyes, and the next thing you know, Santa Claus has vanished!

18:36 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Heh, got a reindeer."

18:36 Obvious commands for a plush reindeer:

18:36   give <this> at/to <any>
  trash <this>
  drop <this>

18:36 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "woo a stuffed one?"

18:36 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Yep."

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large c
18:36 entral video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

18:36 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:36 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
