You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black leather recliner, an internal stun turret, and a large pottery wheel here.
You can go enter and out.

00:42 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
You can go south and out.

00:42 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

00:42 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:42 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

00:42 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

00:42 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:42 You're already sitting down.

00:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

00:42 I don't understand that.

00:42 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:42 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

00:42 The starship must be in space.

00:42 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:42 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "You don't need to if you don't want to as it is early in the evening. I just wanted a little down time."

00:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:42 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:42 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

00:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:42 There are no ships here.

00:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:43 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:43 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

00:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

00:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

23:18 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:18 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

23:18 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:18 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:18 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

23:18 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

23:19 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:19 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "oh boy this will be tesious. Here's one which is just over 16 down"

23:19 Sector 1: Satus (Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists)

23:19 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:19 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:19 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:19 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Wow!"

23:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

23:20 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "there are typically a lot which aren't far down but this is when the poser shovel sure is handy"

23:20 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "power tht is"

23:21 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I bet. I don't have a power shovel, but I bet they're handy."

23:21 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:21 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "well you will need 1000 for that as well"

23:21 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "but you're not far from that goal so that's cool!"

23:22 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Yeah, sounds like a lot of cool things happen at 1000 artifacts."

23:22 I don't understand that.

23:22 You must stand up first.

23:22 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:22 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

23:22 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

23:22 You stand up.

23:23 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard exiting the airlock.

23:23 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Perhaps. I just know of the power shovel and of course you can buy the coating so you can aqua dig"

23:23 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.
