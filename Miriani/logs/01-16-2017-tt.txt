possible for this structure to contain. The slope soon disappears into a dark

approach the start of the slope, then, after a long pause, are unceremoniously

There appears to be some writing on a large holiday-looking sign...
Welcome, boys and girls! My name is Icy the Snowfish! Tell me your holiday
wishes and they just may come true! Icy the Snowfish grants all favors! HO HO
HO!
Forever yours,
Icy
Attention visitors!
To have a visit with Icy, SIGNUP and wait here. A qualified elf will be along to
collect you!
Icy will usually make one item or grant one favor, within reason. Your item can
be entirely custom-made and even have special functionality, but should not
grant you any great advantages in your career of piloting! Ho ho!
Multiple items will sometimes be allowed if they are very simple and part of a
set. For example, an outfit consisting of three clothing items is a reasonable
request.
Kits to create your own unique items are only granted with very careful
consideration and very sparingly. It must be evident that you have some talent
and will take care in creating quality items! Also, the kit must create highly
specific things and not be general purpose. These are not easy to get! If you're
unsure, ask for something else!
Food and drink vendors are easier to obtain, but should have reasonable
specifications and have a clear function. For example, a cookie maker with
several types of cookie is reasonable, but a device that makes cookies,
pancakes, bacon, hot chocolate, coffee, ribeye steaks, and a dozen other things
is not.
No pets or live animals of any kind, including elves.
We cannot make starships, starcharts, battlesuits, or anything else which cannot
be crafted on-site or obtained locally without professional qualifications.
Remember, we elves were trained to make toys and clothing!
Icy is, however, a fully licensed tattoo artist and more than willing to perform
simple body modifications. By asking Icy for a body modification, you hereby
agree to waive all legal rights in the event of a horrible catastrophe. Ho ho
ho!
Use your imagination, but also keep your request grounded in reality! Please do
not test Icy's patience with crazy holiday wishes! Having a holiday wish granted
is a privilege, not a right!
Sincerely,
Franklin the Elf
P.S. Can't wait around? Or reading this after the Icy visit? It may not be too
late to send him a letter!

[Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders; Icy's Happy Holiday House]
Though Icy's house is rather small, it is extravagantly decorated. Icicle lights
hang from every conceivable place, and large amounts of items representing
various holidays are scattered about. A long slab of icy pykrete carved into the
contours of a cushioned bench nestles against the wall as seating for Icy's
guests.
You see a large holiday-looking sign, a sparkly frozen carp, a rocking chair, a
festive holiday-related cypress tree decorated with a small stuffed elk, an elf
tonic dispenser, and Akasha the humanoid service robot here.

possible?"

again."

Damien says to Jingle the Elf, "Thanks!"
Ted Warburton lets out an amused snort, and then a chuckle. The chuckle turns
into deep laugh, which only continues to get louder until Ted Warburton is
clutching his sides, unable to help himself. A few moments later, Ted Warburton
is on the ground, writhing in painful spasms, struggling for breath. Everyone
else looks on in silence.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o'
