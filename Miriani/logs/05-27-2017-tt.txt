Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, and Purr
the humanoid service robot here.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I really would like
to see AEU pilots exploring more, leading expeditions even with the loss of the
arrow and magnetar."
tra 1 There's a name I don't recognize on my communicator. Welcome.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "There's a name I
don't recognize on my communicator. Welcome."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Welcome."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Hello."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You say you love to
explore Shule. Let's organize something."
tra 1 Definitely. Unfortunately, I won't be able to do anything in terms of an
expedition for at least a week or so. The first week of June, I will not be
available much.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Definitely.
Unfortunately, I won't be able to do anything in terms of an expedition for at
least a week or so. The first week of June, I will not be available much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright then, after
that!"
tra 1 However, in the mean time, things that need to be decibe decided include
which ship will be used and the heading that will be taken.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "However, in the
mean time, things that need to be decibe decided include which ship will be used
and the heading that will be taken."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I was thinking more
coreward."
tra 1 And which ship?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And which ship?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Still thinking on
that, we have moderately limited options."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tactical platform is
most likely the best choice."
tra 1 That's the best choice we have for a long exploration trip.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's the best
choice we have for a long exploration trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Then it will have to
work."
tra 1 and really, the only choice we have for a long exploration trip.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And really, the
only choice we have for a long exploration trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Why should we
explore?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The AEU has always
been the alliance of exploration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We have just lost
our way a bit as of late."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Tradition is not a
good reason."
tra 1 Even the arrow, the maximum charge on it is three days and only Ather has
access to an arrow.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Even the arrow, the
maximum charge on it is three days and only Ather has access to an arrow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tradition is a
foundation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not the reason."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Tradition is for
people who have no creativity and no ability."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "What do we get from
exploring?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Shule I am going to
take a nap. I would be happy to discuss this later."
tra 1 Ok, rest well. Talk to you later.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, rest well. Talk
to you later."
tra 1 We learn about other cultures, see amazing nebulas and star formations,
and grow in our understanding of the universe. What do you feel the AEU should
pursue?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We learn about
other cultures, see amazing nebulas and star formations, and grow in our
understanding of the universe. What do you feel the AEU should pursue?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "What good are other
cultures? Our culture is pretty great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I think we should get
rich and make our culture the foremost culture. Others should visit us to learn
how we do things."
tra 1 Not saying our cultures aren't great, but there is always the possibility
of learning new things and gaining greater insite.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not saying our
cultures aren't great, but there is always the possibility of learning new
things and gaining greater insite."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Have you learned
anything from other cultures?"
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps
its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.
trtra 1 Absolutely. We've learned much from the Jinu and from the the species
that left behind the glyphmaker's graves.
I don't understand that.
tra 1 Absolutely. We've learned from the Jinu and from the ones who left behind
the Glyphmaker's graves. And that's just a start.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Absolutely. We've
learned from the Jinu and from the ones who left behind the Glyphmaker's graves.
And that's just a start."
tra 1 The plant that was discovered at the aquarium has proven to be extremely
useful.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The plant that was
discovered at the aquarium has proven to be extremely useful."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "A plant isn't a
culture."
tra 1 Still took exploring to discover it.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Still took
exploring to discover it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "The Gylphmaker's
Graves are just ruins. That's not a culture either. It is a corpse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "The Jinu had
technology, but the Outsiders had even better technology. And both the Jinu and
the Outsiders came to us."
tra 1 Again, we don't know much about the former inhabitants, but we've learned
much from what was left behind. That also took discovery and exploration to
find.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Again, we don't
know much about the former inhabitants, but we've learned much from what was
left behind. That also took discovery and exploration to find."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Looking for things to
loot is okay. But the aliens that made that stuff learned how to make it
originally."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We should focus on
that. Learning to make our own things."
tra 1 I think we should learn what we can, even if it means interacting with
other cultures or exploring. New cultures was only one part of what I said. I
also said that through exploration, we can learn more about our universe.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I think we should
learn what we can, even if it means interacting with other cultures or
exploring. New cultures was only one part of what I said. I also said that
through exploration, we can learn more about our universe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We can learn about
that with telescopes too. Let the astronomers do it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We should be bringing
in money and resources to support our practical researchers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We are better tooled
than they are since we are actually out here."
tra 1 And you think honestly that a telescope could have brought home a plant?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And you think
honestly that a telescope could have brought home a plant?"
tra 1 Or that it could have studied how to be able to detect rift storms?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Or that it could
have studied how to be able to detect rift storms?"
[General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Welcome,
marion, sarah, tare, and aliyah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I think if we make
sure there's plenty of resources, some scientist will come up with something
just as good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "And if some other
group goes and finds that stuff, we can always just buy it from the scavengers
and rag pickers."
tra 1 And what is the point of having a starship, if you're just going to sit at
home, staring through telescopes?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And what is the
point of having a starship, if you're just going to sit at home, staring through
telescopes?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Leave exploration to
the tramps. We should be making the AEU great."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Nest?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Exploration is a way
to make the AEU great. Why rely on others to make the discoveries when we are
able to do so ourselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We shouldn't be
relying on scrounged materials we pick up from long lost aliens."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We should be making
our own stuff."

lost alien race.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We didn't find the
information to create rift storm detectors from a long lost alien race."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Where did you find it
then?"
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an
orange glowing interior pulsates gently.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The information is
contained in a blueprint from another race essentially."

something I didn't hear it. I think I turned my comm's volume way down by
mistake for a moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I knocked my wrist on
the counter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Let this guy do what

fund researchers, and make money from the things they invent on my dime."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh my stars hold me back."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And how do you plan
on getting rich?"
-lily No, you should hold me back.
You say to Lily, "No, you should hold me back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "That's why I became a
pilot. Everyone knows you can get rich doing this."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I am likely the
richest pilot in the universe and guess what much was gained through the awesome
rewards of exploration."
tra 1 Sure, doing what exactly? Because just being a pilot doesn't make you
rich. It means you do have to do something. what is that something you plan on
doing?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure, doing what
exactly? Because just being a pilot doesn't make you rich. It means you do have
to do something. What is that something you plan on doing?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Resource gathering.
There's valuable stuff not that far away. Going out on road trips is stupid."

salvaging then."

Garner wanted to fire all of you."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, and Purr
the humanoid service robot here.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Lily Kaise kisses you.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The starship has left a unique area of space.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers &
Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold
fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a pair of baby blue leather
clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes, and a Tardick lizard
