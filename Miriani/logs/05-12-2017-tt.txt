need to have at least two good wasp pilots. We try to accomodate people who
prefer defense, but in this case in particularr it's limited, so the more people
who are flexible in terms of being willing to salvage the better."

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark

service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a red plastic food storage container,
a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated
blue cooler, a small white trash bin, and Daizey the humanoid service robot
here.

starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a red plastic food storage container,
a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated
blue cooler, a small white trash bin, and Daizey the humanoid service robot
here.
You can go south and out.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery
fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting

one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery
fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large

the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing

Ali Candan strides down.

Johann Schraft sits down on a beige sofa.
Evenia Callseah hugs Johann Schraft.

Johann Schraft hugs Evenia Callseah.

Evenia says to Johann, "We just finished one."
Kim Saunders presses some buttons on the communication board.
To all ships in the sector, this station transmits: "Hi there Blue Marlin."
Johann Schraft grins.
Bryan Stout laughs.

Melinda says to Johann, "So those omega's like to repair at 90%, those are the
ones we lost this go around."

You wave to Morris Corlew.
Morris Corlew waves.
Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "I did. It's all sorted."
Melinda says to Bryan, "Yeah they do but still hafta try to get them to leave."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "They're a pain, but if you get their
average damage to 80, they decide to give up eventually."
Bryan Stout nods.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Melinda says to Evenia in a Bedford accent, "Thanks."
Morris says to Johann, "Not always."
Morris Corlew sighs.
"Of course." Evenia Callseah smiles at Melinda Michaels. "You've all had to do
that enough. I don't mind."
grin eve
You grin at Evenia Callseah.
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I hate to sound callus, but it's not
our fault. Hell half the time if they're still shooting at it I wonder hwy we go
to such lengths if they don't seem to care."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I'm low onn chaingun resists now
though. So I'll have to gun on the next ones if I defend."

You say to Evenia, "There."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Correction, I am not low on
chaingun resists."
Bryan says to Johann, "I'm kind of with you on that. I was throwing out general
sector on a single guerilla at 90 last time and it just wouldn't go. Telling it
to get the fuck out."
Evenia Callseah opens a gold-toned engineering tool case for a moment.
Evenia Callseah puts a chaingun resistance boost in a gold-toned engineering

Nicolette Lawrence waves and waves.

Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I mean, I'm not saying just the hell
with it just shoot them all, but we seem to care more about their lives than
they do."
Rogue says to Evenia in a Ticulian accent, "I rather shoot 'em."
-eve What are your colors/
"Thanks." Evenia Callseah grins at you. "I'm totally out of threads, so can't
make any resists at all."
You say to Evenia, "What are your colors?"
Bryan Stout nods to Johann Schraft.
Evenia says to you in an Ars Magnan accent, "Blue and yellow."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I guess for me...personally...does
n't matter if you don't want your life, I don't wanna be the one to take it.
Maybe I'm weird, I dunno."

You nod to Evenia Callseah. "We should go to GMG some time."
Evenia Callseah nods to you. "Sure."
Kim says to Morris, "Well, most of us are not excited about destroying those
ships and killing the crew. We don't enjoy it, and if there was one sure way we
could make them go without blowing up, I am sure we would use it."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "If my life were on the line it'd
be one thing...but it's not."
nod kim
You nod to Kim Saunders.
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I look at it this way. We do our
utmost to save their lives. If they die, we at least know we did everything we
could. I'm not saying to hell with it, shoot 'em down. But I'm saying that they
have the chance to get out. They can avoid death if they choose to."
Morris says to Kim in an Appalachian accent, "I know. Just...the thought that if
they don't care why should we kinda bothers me personally."
Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah. "Exactly."
nod eve
You nod to Evenia Callseah.
Kim says to Morris, "I do not think that way, and I don't know who does."
Morris says to Kim in an Appalachian accent, "Basically what Johann just said."
Bryan says to Morris, "You're basically putting words into Johanns mouth."
Morris Corlew sighs.
Bryan Stout shrugs.
Morris says to Johann, "Say it again then?"
Kim says to Morris, "I do believe Ather though that they attack and kill each
other out here every day, and that if they wanted something from us and could
kill us to get it, they would not esitate."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I don't know Morris. I concede we've
never had problems with the pods, but relying on them to keep us safe makes us
lazy in battle. That's like saying, "Oh, nothing will happen to me.""
Morris says to Kim in an Appalachian accent, "Sure they do."
Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Has anyone been in an interdicted pod?"
Evenia Callseah nods.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Alko has."
nod
You nod.
'Me too
You say, "Me too."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Take a think about that."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, you are basicly... adrift."
nod
You nod.
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "It's scary as shit."
'It really is.
You say, "It really is."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "If one thing on that pod failed, just
one, you're done."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Gone."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Probably killed, kidnapped or worse."
nod
You nod.
"Exactly." Evenia Callseah nods. "That thought crossed my mind way too many
times when it happened."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Okay."
Kim Saunders nods. "They are considered to be 99 percent full proof, but there
is that 1 percent."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yes we have rescue pods and they
work."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But other things could happen."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "So is it really something we want to
rely on out here? It's us or them. We can try and help them, but if they're not
going to leave I'm not going to risk a ship blowing up and something happening
with that pod."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "It's good what we've been doing from a
humanitarian point of view, but dammit, if you're in battle, you need to always
be in mind that this is the real thing."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Ather has been kidnapped out here
not once but twice."
Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Oh my fuck what?"
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Whaat."
Evenia Callseah nods.
nod
You nod.
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I had no idea about that."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Nabbed him right out of the bar at
Andy's."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Jesus."
nod 
You nod.
Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Yeah, and didn't he get darted and
almost cooked?"
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "If I have very little damage, I'd
rather back off and let them get away then take a kill shot. Again, this is my
thinking. No one has to agree with me. I just...prefer to be responsible for as
few deaths as possible. No matter if they're scoundrels or not."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "As for the unregs, we are all
battling that issue, and have been for the entire week. It is good we question
our moral compas and do not just say hey, who cares that we kill those people.
But we can not get sleepless nights and refuse to defend ourselves because of
that."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I don't want to take lives and do
the best I can to prevent it."
Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "They jump in on us, when we're
not bothering them at all, and they generally initiate contact, knowing what
might happen to them when they do. I don't just sit there and open up on them, I
slow way down, I go slower even than what it's suggested that we do. But no, I'm
not just going to sit there."
Morris says to Melinda, "Exactly. And that's all I'm saying."
Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "But then if we turn this around.
What would they do, if somehow we kidnapped one of theirs? I'm not saying we
would, hell no. But I'm saying...Would they hold back and not kill us?"
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh you bet they would."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Probably depends on the faction."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Probably."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I try and look at things from
every angle. But in the end. If I can save a life I will. If he refuses to
leave. That's on him."
Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.
nod eve
You nod to Evenia Callseah.
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Keep in mind."
Johann Schraft nods to Evenia Callseah.
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "How many unregs have we destroyed that
were not fighters? You can't say we're not making one hell of an effort."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on
Evenia Callseah's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief
moment.
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "That's all we can do really."
Bryan Stout shrugs.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Of course we are."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Well there you go."
Kim says to Morris, "Trying to avoid killing them as best as you can is good.
But if you can not do that, and they keep shooting their chainguns and torps at
you, then I remember the fact that we did not provoke them, we did not start
attacking them, they came to attack us, and steal from us if they get a chance."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Exactly. We do what we can. We
can't do anything else."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Also keep in mind, piracy has always
been a capital offense, even in the days of sailing ships."
Morris says to Bryan, "I didn't say we weren't. I just commented on what Johann
said."
Bryan Stout nods to Kim Saunders. "Exactly what I'm trying to say."
nod
You nod.
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "If I'm starting to lose failsafes
because of them and they're not leaving I'm eventually going to have to make the
call."
Evenia Callseah nods to Bryan Stout.
Johann Schraft nods.
'exactly
You say, "Exactly."
Nicolette Lawrence asks in a California accent, "How many cans left?"
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Of course."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "They seem to have gotten a lot smarter
though."
Morris says to Nicolette, "Two."
Evenia says to Nicolette, "2."
'There only so many times I'm going to let them shoot at me.
You say, "There only so many times I'm going to let them shoot at me."
Nicolette Lawrence nods.
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "And again, I'm extremely glad Tanny
isn't here for these discussions."
Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Why?"
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Oh god."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I'm glad she isn't here
period."
Evenia Callseah nods and wrinkles her nose.
'Why?
Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.
You ask, "Why?"
'I don't know her very well
You say, "I don't know her very well."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, why?"
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "She is very vehement about not doing
delta ops."
Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "And?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Not just delta."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Because. She's just a nut job
in general."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "What's wrong with that? It's her
choice."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Very vehement."
Bryan says to Morris, "Because we'd never hear the end of it from her."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Oh yeah, that's her choice
completely. But she will go on and on and on at people who do."
Johann Schraft nods.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am sure Anfisa and some of the
mutuality really would do that too."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "They wanted to come out here."
Bryan Stout glares.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Look. We could have a death
penalty dicussion...and you know what side of that I'd come down on? Piracy
being a capital offense...to me is...a nonissue. I don't want to be the
executioner, but if I have to shoot at them and they don't get out in time...it
just...it's not something I like, but I do what I have to do. If Tnny feels more
strongly about it than I do, then she does."
Johann Schraft nods to Morris Corlew.
Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "It's like...Um. I can't think who
it is. but we've got a pilot who flatly refuses to do GMG. The difference is. he
doesn't take issue with people that do."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "She's entited to not participate."
Morris says to Evenia, "James."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "That's fine."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Yep."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Why is that? I don't think i've
heard this."
Morris says to Bryan, "Doesn't seem like it is."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have respect for people in
general. I believe that we should work together, if we want a chance at
surviving the outsiders when they come in force. I'm against senseless killing,
but after 2 years and several months, I know by now the difference between
senseless killing and self defense."
nod kim
You nod to Kim Saunders.
Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Why isn't it fine that someone doesn't
do GMG but doesn't go on and on about others that do?"
Bryan Stout shrugs.
Morris says to Bryan, "I thought you were saying it's fine about what I said..."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Because that's a personal choice."
Morris says to Bryan, "But it hasn't seemed like it."
Bryan says to Morris, "I nodded in agreement with you."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "But."
Bryan Stout shrugs helplessly.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Have I gone on about folks
opinions on this? No. The only time I had an issue was Johann's joke about going
after Lambdas for lenses."
Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Okay, so say we were getting an op
together and a barge hopped in and asked to salvage on the op, would you let
them?"
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "No."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Of course not."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "What I'm trying to say is. It's
totally his choice that he doesn't choose to, but he doesn't judge others for
doing it. Tanny on the other hand, would go on and on about us doing these ops."
Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Why not?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm, our government probably would
not be too happy."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Yeah...for one, we'd lose our
licenses. But for two, you've gotta consider motivation there."
Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "I don't know, they need some money and
don't want to steal?"
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "If they wanna just go after
materials to help us out? Where's that comin from? Our government wouldn't pay
them for it."
Kim Saunders glances at the coordinate rundown.
Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "What would be the harm though?"
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "So they throw some debris in the can."
Bryan Stout gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "And what would be the point too?
To me it'd look like there was some other motive there."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Well, I don't know, but it could be a
good chance to start a dialog. I would honestly consider it."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Why not? Sounds reasonable."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I don't know."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Better than Akemi wanting to
talk to the IFS anyway."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's
neck.
Kim studies the rundown carefully for a moment before she "asks: "Wow, see all
that debris? How many sectors full of debris do you think this oort has? Plenty
of room for Lambdas, and all the other factions out here to build their station,
and still not have to meet while salvaging. So why do they need from our can? Or
want to fill our can?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Personally, I don't think trying to
talk to the IFS is a bad idea."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Don't most of us wanna talk to the
IFS? I've heard that from countless pilots."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I'd talk to the IFS if it meant having
them on our side."
Kim Saunders nods. "I would agree with that."
nod
You nod.
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I'll talk to the IFS when they
jump in to talk and not start shooting the second before they get there."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "You can't start talks expecting a
specific outcome."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Never said you could."
Vernos says to Nicolette, "May have to go to them for that."
Bryan says to Vernos, "That would be...hard."
The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Blurr" has suddenly appeared
on sensor scans.
Morris says to Bryan, "You siad you'd talk to the IFS if it meant having them on
our side."
Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "But the way things operate
right now, no. If they ever jumped in, and nothing happened? Sure, why not."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "That's not going to happen."
Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Anyway my point is if the unregs wanted
some sort of contact that was nonviolent and could lead to beneficial, I would
think it would be worth it."
Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Nope."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We'd need to do something to show
that we don't want to fight."
Evenia Callseah nods to Johann Schraft.

l eve
Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth.
Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her very
short, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey
mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red
cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her
hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin
charm pierces her left upper ear, and a thick gold ring with a spider charm
pierces her right upper ear.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and
gold dichroic glass, a slinky light blue halterneck top with a v-neck, a pair of
heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very long darkly gleaming
steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked daggers around her
waist, a pair of torn skinny black low rise jeans, and a pair of chunky black
leather boots with numerous straps and buckles. She is also wearing an
eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass
dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a
chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle
of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian wrist-mounted chronometer, a
metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns
of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone
firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the
side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched
on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both shoulders, back, both biceps,
both elbows, and both hands are left uncovered.

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

[Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Gonzales told me he would love to just do an op with a corvette or flying wing
as defense and 1 salvager. I heard someone mention, whether for fun or whatever
reason to launch a beacon in the middle of an op. Yeah, and hen the ship that

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery
fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard
named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists,
and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties and a pair of white
leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in
a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring
inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly
labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, both
thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
