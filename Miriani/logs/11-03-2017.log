It is addressed to nobody and was sent by nobody.

my dearest Love,
First, I'm quite surprised that you were upset with my being in your ship. Since i am the one who left, I find it perplexing that you took offense. i honestly thought that you would be pleased to find that i had returned. I thought you would be happy to see me and that we could at least discuss things. I also felt that it was the time the other night when I left that i felt that I was so ready to consumate my love with you. I had been thinking often lately of how i wanted to make love with you and how I'd just so much wish that we had the opportunity to just hangout for a couple of days and cuddle and make awesome love. I know that for me, i've always wanted that to be a special time, a special moment in our lives when I could express how I truly feel about you. I didn't want it to be just a casual experience as for me love-making isn't merely a physical act. For me, making love is the deepest possible emotional experience one can ever have. I expressed how heart-broken I was and I meant it because here I was finally ready. Then you turned your back on me.
I know Love it's not been an easy time for you to wait for me to be ready to be more physical. It's just that I wanted to be certain that you truly felt the same way and that when we did take that special journey into the depths of our love, that it would be the beginning of something which was everlasting.
I am so sorry for making the statements I did. I deeply am but don't you understand that what you did was deliberately hurtful? What had I done which was so wrong for you to seem as though you went out on a cheap and hurtful act to be cruel to me. How would you have felt if after hearing you express how hurt you were and sad, and then you discovered I was in a house which belongs to nobody which has a name that sounds like some sort of a house of ill repute or a place where pilots go to exploit sex? Yes, I looked up the property and it is to be auctioned. Obviously, whomever you are having your sexual escapades with doesn't have the decency to take you to her own place but must poach in a property which isn't hers. She was obviously added to the garage and Biometric lock so how sneaky. how can you trus that sort of judgement over mine? Oh too, how in two days can you say that you love someone else? Again, I don't feel remorseful for calling this person cheap and one I would not readily consider to have true feelings. There are women pilots around and yes I can name several, who will talk the talk and make you feel all warm and loved when they're just as much into the experience as you are for it's physical value. Love does not evolve overnight and you should know this. All I can ask of you my Darling is that you would please stop to consider that your actions were themselves hurtful. you didn't even seem to want to 
00:54 talk with me but gave me the cold shoulder for a wrong which I did not commit. I was so looking forward to being with you then and yes, as i said, I truly thought that you would see it that I wanted to show you forgiveness when you found me there. I had also placed a special bed in your ship for us. So no Love, it wasn't intended at all to be spiteful. I am shocked! because I also thought perhaps what you did was a sort of acting out. That you felt rejected by me perhaps and that by my returning to you and being available for you would show you how much I truly cared.
Please Honey, I truly believe that we should try to work out our issues. I thought that I meant enough to you that should we have differences, that you wouldn't just do something mean and hurtful like this as a form of 'getting even?' I truly don't understand as I had no idea that you were angry with me over anything? I'm not a mind reader Sweetheart. I am merely a human being who needs to be treated with reason. What you have done is not reasonable because you never even provided me with a means of defense. Still, the only thing which seems to be quite obvious is that you wanted sex? Well you were certainly about to have what i hoped would be a good time with me <smiles!>.
I know my Love, that i haven't been at work as much for the past couple of months as well. But you know if it had of been you, I would wait until the end of time for you. I would travel to the end of this Universe and beyond for you because I love you more than any man in the Universe. It would be worth the wait to me. It truly would be because I love you so much and you are worth it. Not because you are the handsomest man in the Universe as that's just a wonderful fringe benefit. If you weren't so handsome, I would still love everything about you. We have had interruptions in the time that when I have been here. When you decided to leave and then return, this took a lot of our timewhich we could have enjoyed together. I'm not blaming you for this, just merely pointing out that there have been circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I have been here, you've frequently been involved in space combat and I will admit that I have felt a bit ignored as you had many hours to work yet it seemed that work was more important so you show up around the time when I'm generally going to sleep. How is that enough time to begin our love-making journey?
There is an exception to my love for you and that is I don't love it how you flaunted your actions with someone else to hurt me. Yes I may forgive you for this in time though as I know that men are more physical and often do act out which seems to be what you have done especially if they don't think they are being satisfied. I am so deeply sorry Babe that you went to such lengths and when we are together again and I believe we will be, that you have my assurance that you can always express your concerns to me. You are free to tell me everything you want and you should never hold back. I might not always be comfortable with what you say but we should always have open communications. Honesty is paramount in every relationship which works.
This is no way to call what we have over Love. Relationships are work but I am willing to listen to you and to do whatever it takes to please you. I so want this to work for us. I know that whomever you are with, that your rushing into things is most definitely not going to be good for you. How do you know that she hasn't drawn you in for other selfish reasons? I know that some women who are associated with pirates and other dishonest types will prey upon others who have assets and use sociopathic behavior to take advantage of someone like you. You are a very nice guy and easy-going and you are definitely a target. I love you honestly and sincerely and not for anything other than for you. Yourself had nothing when you met me and although what you have achieved is incredible, it's still a vulnerable spot for you as someone could take advantage of you very easily.
I will leave the garage access open to to you here at Empanda and i am enclosing a couple of starship keys. I just ask you never to bring anyone into my ships without my consent or unless they are mutual friends of ours.
I love you Tibo.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

16:40 You sit down on an overstuffed gold gunner's chair.

16:40 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I'm only eng cause I'm lagging"

16:41 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "and I don't wanna embarras any of you gunners"

16:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:41 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:41 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:42 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:42 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:42 You press a small button mounted on the wall and chuckle and say, "Seeing as I'm not that good at gunning... I appreciate that."

16:42 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

16:42 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:42 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:42 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:42 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:42 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:42 Kenny Marley's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "well, how long have you been gunning?"

16:42 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:42 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:42 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Not even a year."

16:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:43 Therman Donaldson's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "The gate is real close."

20:46 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
