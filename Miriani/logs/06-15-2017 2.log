00:01:44 On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls from the sky.

00:12:01 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

00:12:11 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

00:42:08 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

00:52:43 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

00:55:17 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Which one is not the gross pbj?"

00:55:30 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The first one is the good one."

01:02:55 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

01:12:28 The curtains close, to no applause.

01:12:38 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

01:13:30 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

01:13:30 A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers here.

02:42:34 Ather Jammoa gives an empty white coffee cup with purple accents to Eli Grey.

02:42:42 Ather Jammoa says, "I thought it was like the ones you can order off of SSN."

02:42:48 Ather Jammoa gives a cup of hot black coffee to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:42:48 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:42:56 Ather Jammoa says, "Those ones are fillable."

02:42:57 Eli Grey says, "Must be the Foldger's Paradox."

02:43:01 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

02:43:02 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

02:43:03 Eli Grey snickers.

02:43:09 Lily Kaise says, "Eek."

02:43:13 Eli Grey says, "That damn squid."

02:43:14 Morris Corlew exclaims, "Squiddy!"

02:43:16 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Go away dude!"

02:43:18 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:43:20 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

02:43:22 Morris Corlew says, "Awww, it's a cool squid."

02:43:23 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "Man the harpoons!"

02:43:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:43:36 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Definitely squid meat!"

02:44:00 Eli Grey says, "It was interesting that the coffee vanished with the duplicate and it was the cup that got left."

02:44:07 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

02:44:14 Ather says to Eli, "Well, the duplicate probably wanted some fucking coffee."

02:44:15 Ather Jammoa grins.

02:44:16 Morris Corlew says, "Looked like he spilled it on himself."

02:44:49 Ather Jammoa says, "It was probably another eli from the multiverse on another expedition similar to this one but with enough differences to make him be in his own universe as a part of the multiverse."

02:44:55 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

02:44:57 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

02:45:15 Eli Grey says, "Yeah.. someone said that yesterday, I can't remember who. I suppose it makes sense."

02:45:26 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

02:45:37 Eli Grey says, "That eli is probably having a similar but not exact conversation right now with some laternate version of you."

02:45:41 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, we've created enough diverging points in our own timeline. Especially when we got riftletters from our future selves."

02:45:44 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

02:46:19 Ather Jammoa says, "That being said, there is probably a timeline or universe where all of the planets were destroyed, because alternate Fienstein did open the rift."

02:46:25 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

02:46:34 Eli Grey says, "I was thinking about that last night, those letters we all got."

02:46:41 Eli Grey says, "Right around that time."

02:47:02 Eli Grey says, "Or a bunch of us got anyways."

02:47:13 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:47:14 Ather Jammoa says, "I still have copies of those."

02:47:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:47:29 Ather Jammoa says, "Even Herrik's nonsensical one."

02:47:32 Eli Grey says, "I believe most of them were of places being torn apart, I think mine said something about New Earth cracking like an egg."

02:47:39 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

02:47:46 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

02:47:49 Eli Grey says, "Oh wow, I forgot about that one, folks kept trying to crack it."

02:48:12 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:48:20 Eli Grey exclaims, "Woo!"

02:48:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, we tried a shitton of things until Fienstein told us about the paradoxical shifts and why the letters were as garbled as they were. Apparently, herrik tried to include way too much explanation in his letter."

02:48:23 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:48:23 A readout shows Planetary System 1754-7444 about 22.03 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southeast and Very Slightly Up.

02:48:24 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "PLANETS!!!!"

02:48:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yup."

02:48:25 Lily Kaise says, "Yay."

02:48:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I found planets."

02:48:31 You cheer.

02:48:32 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

02:48:48 Eli Grey says, "Something about it being sent over and over so many times or something with smaller bits getting through."

02:48:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Peter Milaro spent like, a week trying to crack that fucking letter."

02:48:58 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

02:49:05 Eli Grey asks, "Anyone else want to grab it? Vernos?"

02:49:07 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The mystery is in the penis of Herrik."

02:49:12 Lily Kaise points at you.

02:49:13 Ather Jammoa gives Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec a high five.

02:49:13 Morris Corlew asks, "Vern, have you done any approaches?"

02:49:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:49:19 Ather Jammoa says, "All hail the mighty sphere-trapped penis."

02:49:30 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

02:49:30 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

02:49:36 Eli Grey says, "Erm."

02:49:41 Eli Grey asks, "Someone's already on it I guess?"

02:49:45 Ather Jammoa frowns.

02:49:46 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

02:49:46 Ather Jammoa strides south.

02:49:47 Morris Corlew nods. "Guess so."

02:49:49 Lily Kaise asks, "Maybe Rogue?"

02:49:52 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

02:49:53 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

02:49:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Damien."

02:49:56 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The power of penis of Herrik is ever growing, soon it will have own riftscape."

02:49:58 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

02:50:01 Lily Kaise says, "Oh no not her haha thought she went out."

02:50:09 Rogue Romano shakes her head.

02:50:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:50:19 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

02:50:22 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:50:23 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:50:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Spectro, image, survey and some probes."

02:50:44 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I spy a Damien Goss."

02:50:50 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

02:50:54 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:50:54 Eli says to you, "If Damien's already done a few, I bet he wouldn't midn if you went on up and asked to take over."

02:50:59 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:51:06 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm glad I haven't seen an alternate of me yet. I'd much rather correspond with myself only via letter."

02:51:20 Ather Jammoa says, "And...roast beef sandwiches."

02:51:27 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:51:48 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If someone else wants to come steer feel free. I just happened to be getting out of bed when Morris called out planets, so I went to go see who was steering."

02:51:49 Morris Corlew says, "Because one Ather is plenty."

02:52:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Not necessarily. I'm more worried about the fact that my alternate will be a nicer guy than me who actually coddles people."

02:52:14 Ather Jammoa shudders.

02:52:16 Eli Grey laughs at Ather Jammoa.

02:52:20 Ather Jammoa says, "Even the thought sickens me."

02:52:22 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "I have never seen nor have I received anything from an alternate self."

02:52:25 Eli Grey asks, "The opposite of an evil twin?"

02:52:29 Ather says to Eli, "Yeah."

02:52:32 Ather Jammoa grins at Anfisa the Wanderer.

02:53:04 Morris says to Ather, "I had to think about that a sec, when I heard ya, I thought ya said who cuddles folks."

02:53:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Fuck that shit."

02:53:15 Eli says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Would you want to? Maybe that's sorta part of it?"

02:53:16 Morris Corlew laughs.

02:53:21 Eli Grey shrugs.

02:53:21 Ather Jammoa says, "If you want to cuddle get a stuffed animal."

02:53:38 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:53:44 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Anyone could cuddle Ather. He is too much of a wimp to struggle or fight back."

02:53:44 Lily Kaise says, "Naa Shule is better."

02:53:52 Ather says to Anfisa of Marzore, "You keep away scary person."

02:53:53 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:53:53 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:54:15 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:54:23 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Is simple fact."

02:54:34 Ather says to Rogue, "I don't miss as often as Aisling does!"

02:54:34 Rogue Romano says, "Here, I'll cuddle with Ather."

02:54:35 Ather Jammoa curls his hand into a fist.

02:54:43 Rogue Romano smirks.

02:54:51 Aisling says to Ather, "Want me to miss?"

02:55:04 Ather says to Aisling, "Na, I don't want you to be hurting anyone else right now."

02:55:11 Ather Jammoa says, "The sofa is a bit crowded."

02:55:21 Aisling the Fox says, "I can drag you to emptier room."

02:55:39 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah which is why I prefer to crowd Shule on this floor pillow."

02:55:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:55:49 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "You keep away from me you freak of nature!"

02:55:58 Aisling the Fox cuddles up to Ather Jammoa.

02:56:04 Rogue Romano grins.

02:56:12 Ather squirms desperately and pushes violently against Aisling.

02:56:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Get off get off get off."

02:56:24 Lily Kaise snickers.

02:56:29 Aisling the Fox says, "I am trying if you stop squirming."

02:56:33 Eli Grey says, "Oh man, where'd Damien to snap a picture when you need him."

02:56:36 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo go Aisling!"

02:56:44 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:56:48 Ather continues to squirm and push and cuffs Aisling lightly on the top of the head.

02:56:54 Aisling the Fox knocks on Ather Jammoa's head.

02:57:02 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Get off get off get off!"

02:57:08 Aisling sits back down on a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

02:57:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

02:57:27 Ather says to Aisling, "Nutcase."

02:57:29 Ather Jammoa shudders.

02:58:47 Ather Jammoa says, "Wow, this looks like a pretty big planetary system."

02:59:14 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

02:59:21 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:59:48 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

03:00:20 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

03:00:27 Eli Grey roams south.

03:03:12 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shule, Vern, you sure neither of you guys wants to come bring us in?"

03:07:05 Nissi Valdaire gives a hot cup of pad thai to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:07:20 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

03:07:20 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:07:40 Sarah Bellamy waves.

03:07:42 Ather says to Sarah, "You forgot to clothe yourself, it would seem."

03:07:48 Ather Jammoa says, "No, this is not a dream."

03:07:51 Morris says to Sarah, "Howdy sweets."

03:07:59 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh my.....Thanks Ather."

03:08:00 Morris Corlew beams at Sarah Bellamy.

03:08:02 Sarah Bellamy blushes.

03:08:05 Sarah Bellamy hugs Morris Corlew.

03:08:06 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:08:06 Sarah Bellamy bebops south.
Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:08:08 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

03:08:08 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:08:19 I see no "sarah" here.

03:08:42 Ather chuckles to himself and returns his gaze to the rift console.

03:09:27 Nissi Valdaire says, "Weird."

03:09:31 Aisling the Fox says, "Very."

03:09:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:10:10 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

03:12:50 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well this is gonna take a while."

03:13:12 Aisling the Fox nods.

03:13:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:14:07 Vernos Bailey says, "Yup."

03:14:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Should tell them no extended."

03:14:21 Vernos Bailey laughs.

03:14:58 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

03:15:08 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

03:15:24 Vernos Bailey says, "At least that is what I assume you mean."

03:15:27 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:16:12 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

03:16:12 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

03:17:11 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

03:17:30 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Go for it man, you can do it. You gotta learn sometime."

03:17:55 Vernos Bailey says into the PA microphone, "I will learn when I can get one."

03:18:01 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's really not as bad as it looks, and with the flow being so slow,  it's highly doubtful you will overshoot."

03:18:16 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right on."

03:18:17 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Even if you do, the best of the best overshoot."

03:18:23 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Indeed."

03:18:46 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "C'mon shule, you said you wanted to do it, why aren't you coming up?"

03:19:21 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I think he's ignoring us."

03:19:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:21:04 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

03:21:35 Morris Corlew glances at Vernos Bailey quickly out of the corner of his eye as he walks over to a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:21:38 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:22:04 You gag slightly.

03:22:04 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

03:23:03 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:23:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:23:31 You begin dry heaving.

03:23:32 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:24:31 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

03:25:40 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

03:25:40 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:25:45 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

03:26:12 Rogue Romano yawns.

03:26:32 Sarah Bellamy says to Rogue, "Sleepy?"

03:26:43 Rogue says to Sarah Bellamy, "A little."

03:26:44 Morris Corlew squeezes Sarah Bellamy affectionately.

03:26:45 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

03:26:45 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:27:03 Sarah Bellamy leans on Morris Corlew.

03:27:05 Rogue Romano glances down at her platinum watch with a round face momentarily.

03:27:20 Rogue Romano says, "I've been awake for bout an hour and half."

03:27:26 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:27:44 Morris Corlew wraps his arms around Sarah Bellamy, pulling her close.

03:27:45 Rogue Romano says, "May hop into hot tub after this system."

03:27:46 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

03:28:15 Sarah nestles herself under Morris's chin.

03:28:16 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Praise the tub."

03:28:24 Rogue Romano nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

03:28:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Come here, little system."

03:28:57 Rogue Romano grins.

03:29:01 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

03:29:11 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy lovingly on the top of her head.

03:29:16 Sarah Bellamy beams.

03:29:23 Sarah Bellamy says, "I love it more and more each time you do that."

03:29:27 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:29:28 Morris Corlew smiles at Sarah Bellamy.

03:29:30 Rogue Romano giggles.

03:29:45 Rogue Romano says, "I miss my Jacob."

03:29:51 Sarah Bellamy says, "Awwww."

03:30:05 Rogue Romano grins.

03:30:52 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:33:27 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:34:18 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

03:34:19 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:35:18 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:36:18 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

03:36:19 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:37:12 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

03:37:19 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:44:05 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

03:44:05 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:45:05 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

03:45:27 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:46:41 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:46:41 A readout shows Planetary System 1754-7444 about 12.7 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southeast.

03:47:03 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:47:17 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:50:39 Morris smiles at Sarah, then rubs his cheek against hers.

03:51:09 Sarah beams and pretends as if to try to nip at Morris's nose.

03:51:12 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

03:51:38 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

03:51:38 You hear a wet tearing sound.

03:52:30 Morris Corlew looks at Sarah Bellamy thoughtfully.

03:52:35 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

03:52:36 Morris Corlew leans toward Sarah Bellamy and softly licks her nose.

03:52:38 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

03:52:39 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:52:48 Sarah Bellamy exclaims, "Mrow! I mean...A...choo!"

03:53:28 Morris Corlew gasps.

03:53:36 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

03:53:43 Morris removes a white satin handkerchief from his backpack and dabs at Sarah's nose with it.

03:53:53 Sarah Bellamy says, "It was a play pretend meow sneeze."

03:54:01 Morris Corlew grins at Sarah Bellamy.

03:54:04 Sarah Bellamy beams.

03:54:55 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

03:54:55 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:55:55 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:56:18 Morris Corlew caresses Sarah Bellamy's thighs.

03:56:23 Sarah Bellamy shivers.

03:56:24 Sarah Bellamy smiles.

03:56:46 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew softly on the neck.

03:57:20 Morris Corlew smiles at Sarah Bellamy.

03:58:27 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

03:58:27 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

03:59:27 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

03:59:28 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:02:25 Morris Corlew leans close to Sarah Bellamy and whispers something in her ear.

04:02:38 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

04:02:38 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

04:03:26 You begin dry heaving.

04:03:43 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:03:53 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:03:56 Morris wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

04:05:28 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:09:46 Sarah Bellamy leans close to Morris Corlew and whispers something in his ear.

04:10:33 Morris Corlew leans close to Sarah Bellamy and whispers something in her ear.

04:10:33 You overhear Morris Corlew whispering to Sarah Bellamy, "I dunno. Thought maybe you did."

04:10:38 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

04:11:28 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:12:06 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

04:12:55 Morris lays his palms on Sarah's knees and rests his chin on her shoulder.

04:12:57 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

04:13:28 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:15:28 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:16:07 Sarah Bellamy says, "You go orange tentacle beast, attack that glass."

04:17:09 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

04:17:10 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

04:17:48 The curtains close, to no applause.

04:17:52 Morris Corlew says, "Yay."

04:17:57 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

04:18:00 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

04:18:03 Sarah Bellamy says, "Not so yay."

04:18:09 Morris Corlew says, "Mmhmm."

04:18:10 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

04:18:15 Morris Corlew says, "Hey, the time in between was nice."

04:18:15 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Do they know th ey're going the wrong direction?"

04:18:17 Morris Corlew shrugs.

04:18:29 Morris Corlew says, "Tacking."

04:18:33 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh."

04:18:34 Morris Corlew says, "Trying to get us some speed."

04:18:38 Sarah Bellamy says, "Okay."

04:19:18 Vernos Bailey asks, "How long have we been approaching this?"

04:19:29 Morris Corlew says, "Awhile. Flow is against us."

04:19:52 Vernos Bailey says, "And then you are talking like four hours on a probe afterwards."

04:19:54 Vernos Bailey laughs.

04:20:08 Morris Corlew asks, "Maybe. Depends on what kind of system it is?"

04:20:08 Sarah Bellamy says, "Not the close approach probes."

04:20:24 Morris says to Vernos, "Plus, what's the rush? We've got plenty of charge."

04:20:41 Vernos Bailey says, "Just laughing is all."

04:20:51 Morris Corlew says, "At what? I'm...missin the joke."

04:20:52 Vernos Bailey says, "Well inside."

04:20:57 Sarah Bellamy says, "Me too."

04:21:53 Morris Corlew says, "Remember, it's the journey, not the destination that matters."

04:21:58 Sarah Bellamy grins.

04:22:12 Vernos Bailey says, ""Morris your mind is a journey."

04:22:17 Morris says to Vernos, "Maybe."

04:23:27 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

04:23:27 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

04:23:59 Vernos Bailey says, "Now that is good speed."

04:24:13 Sarah Bellamy says, "That's better yeah."

04:24:27 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

04:26:40 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

04:26:41 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

04:27:15 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

04:27:15 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

04:28:14 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

04:38:33 Rogue Romano yawns. "Damn, takin' sooo long.."

04:38:47 Sarah Bellamy says, "I know. I've never seen anything like it."

04:38:57 Morris Corlew says, "I have. I've done some that took longer."

04:39:05 Lily Kaise nods.

04:39:05 Sarah Bellamy says, "Wow."

04:39:09 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

04:39:13 Morris Corlew says, "At the mercy of the flow."

04:39:41 Look at what?

04:42:32 You finish off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:42:52 You give a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:42:56 "I did an approach that took over 3 hours once." Morris Corlew nods. "I've also done one that took less than 10 from when we saw whatever it was. So...it's just one of those things. We're out here usin the rift, but yet we're at the mercy of its whims."

04:43:26 Sarah Bellamy removes a sheet of white paper from a maple coffee table.

04:44:28 Sarah Bellamy puts a sheet of white paper on a maple coffee table.

04:44:38 Morris Corlew removes a sheet of white paper from a maple coffee table.

04:44:43 Morris Corlew crumples up his sheet of white paper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

04:45:28 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:45:45 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Why are there eggs on the coffee table? Are they for someone?"

04:45:55 Morris Corlew shrugs and gestures vaguely at Lily Kaise.

04:45:56 Lily Kaise says, "They are for anyone who wants them."

04:45:58 You say, "They're there for the taking."

04:46:07 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Oh...For free?"

04:46:46 Lily Kaise says, "My fish have produced a few eggs during the trip and thought I would share."

04:47:00 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Wow...thank you. I've never had orange eggs before, what do they make?"

04:47:10 Lily Kaise says, "Seastars."

04:47:26 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Ah! What eggs do the tentacle thingies produce?"

04:47:28 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:47:36 Lily points to a seastar in the aquarium.

04:47:38 "Black maybe?" Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:47:48 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

04:47:48 Lily Kaise says, "It's the oneview aquarium."

04:53:37 Lily Kaise puts a neon purple efficient round egg storage container in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:55:25 Lily says to Sarah, "Those seastars will last a very long time They ive the longest and they breed the least often so don't panic if you don't see any eggs for a few months."

04:55:38 Sarah Bellamy smiles at Lily Kaise. "Okay, thanks for the tip."

04:55:48 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

04:56:06 Lily Kaise puts an orange egg on a maple coffee table.

04:56:08 Morris says to a Tardick lizard named Raissa, "Howdy there Raissa."

04:56:11 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Raissa's warm scaly skin.

04:56:11 Sarah Bellamy says, "Whoah...I've never seen that lizard before."

04:56:17 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:56:20 Lily Kaise says, "Ok this one is for vernos whenever he is ready for it."

04:56:47 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

04:56:51 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm haven't seen Asteria for awhile."

04:56:54 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:56:55 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:57:19 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

04:57:20 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aha here she is."

04:57:29 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:58:04 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

04:59:10 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:59:13 Lily Kaise glides east.

04:59:42 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

05:02:49 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

05:03:09 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Raissa mostly lives on my ship. I feel no need to wear her like scarf."

05:03:19 Lily Kaise grins.

05:04:24 Sarah Bellamy grins at Anfisa the Wanderer.

05:06:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:07:21 A Tardick lizard named Raissa blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:07:52 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

05:07:52 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

05:08:07 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

05:08:12 Nissi Valdaire says, "So close."

05:08:28 Aisling the Fox says nothing.

05:08:34 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

05:10:44 Aisling the Fox says, "Trim up and we are there."

05:10:56 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:10:56 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a classic system of mixed rocky and gas planets, much like the systems where all of humanity's colonies can be found.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:11:09 Lily Kaise says, "Ooo nice."

05:11:12 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

05:11:14 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

05:11:14 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

05:11:54 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on extended observation."

05:12:39 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Got a good feeling about this oen folks."

05:13:19 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

05:13:24 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

05:13:24 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Would be nice if it really was as close to some of ours as that sensor display is lookin like."

05:13:29 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

05:13:30 Rogue Romano slinks south.

05:16:12 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

05:16:31 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

05:17:17 Lily Kaise

05:17:17 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small gold dragonflies, a pair of skinny white low rise jeans, and a pair of dark purple ship shoes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia
05:17:17  Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio in her right hand.

05:18:15 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

05:18:33 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ather slightly greater than sol."

05:18:43 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

05:18:51 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "Na, no not worth the bolt's panels then. Thanks."

05:18:55 Lily Kaise says, "That's very nice."

05:19:00 Morris Corlew says, "Wait."

05:19:05 Morris Corlew says, "It's greater than Sol..."

05:19:11 Morris Corlew says, "So it's gonna charge faster."

05:19:15 Morris looks confused.

05:19:32 Morris Corlew asks, "Thought this was one of the best places to charge?"

05:19:51 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "It would be of note, yes."

05:19:57 Morris Corlew nods.

05:20:12 Ather Jammoa says, "It's more for the reason that I'm going to go to bed soon."

05:20:14 Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

05:20:16 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

05:20:18 Lily Kaise says, "'i'd think anything Sol or greater than Sol would be great."

05:20:18 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Ather just wants his vessels to remain in the packaging."

05:20:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:20:25 Morris Corlew grins at Anfisa the Wanderer.

05:20:53 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Lovingly wiped down with a diaper every evening."

05:21:08 Morris Corlew shakes his head and chuckles.

05:21:12 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

05:21:26 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

05:21:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

05:26:12 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

05:27:21 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

05:27:37 Morris runs one hand along a Tardick lizard named Raissa's spine.

05:29:53 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

05:30:02 Morris Corlew says, "Asteroid."

05:30:23 Morris reaches inside a slate blue leather gear bag and partially removes a bulky asteroid supply cannon, then places it back inside.

05:30:32 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

05:30:47 Morris Corlew says, "That'd be a pretty bad idea, even if this ship was capable of doin it."

05:30:48 Morris Corlew chuckles.

05:30:51 A Tardick lizard named Raissa blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:31:22 Morris Corlew glances down at his mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

05:33:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

05:43:32 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

05:44:11 Sarah says to Morris, "Did you want to go watch the surveyin with everyone else? I'm kind of pinning you down here but I can move."

05:44:26 Morris Corlew says, "Sure. We can go up."

05:45:05 Sarah Bellamy stands up from Morris Corlew's lap.

05:45:29 Sarah Bellamy bebops south.

05:45:29 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

05:45:31 Morris Corlew lopes south.

05:45:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

05:46:41 Lily Kaise says, "It's really amazing to watch the equipment up there but I think I'll stay right here as it's pretty crowded up there."

05:47:21 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:47:27 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:49:04 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:49:10 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:09:02 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

06:09:06 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

06:16:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:16:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:16:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:16:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:16:53 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "How many planets in there?"

06:18:07 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

06:18:23 Lily Kaise says, "Well how rude but whatever."

06:26:19 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

06:26:36 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

06:27:18 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

06:27:27 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

06:28:03 Lily Kaise says, "Wow 7."

06:29:32 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Goodnight Damien."

06:30:11 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Good night all and thanks for at least sharing the info on the message board."

06:30:22 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

06:30:32 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Good night, you should have come up and done a probe."

06:31:25 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I have to sleep sorry. I'm awake later than I should be actually andit's so crowded up there with all of those elbows."

06:31:42 You hear a loud clang, followed by a distinct thud: the sound of a ship docking.

06:32:22 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I figured they wouldn't allow me to touch anything anyway."

06:35:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:36:39 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

06:39:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

06:40:52 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki taps her claws on the floor.

06:45:53 You hear a low scraping sound as the ship undocks.

06:46:05 You hear an odd rumbling sound as the large docking bay door opens.

06:46:10 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

06:46:22 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

07:12:25 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Goodnight Vernos, I'll try not to snore too loud."

07:12:31 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

07:12:42 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't don't launch probes into quarters five."

07:12:48 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And all will be good."

07:12:51 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay, will do."

07:13:14 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Eli, need extended probe sent to quarters five."

07:13:26 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Setting probe for maximum penetration."

07:13:32 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she cackles!

07:15:48 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "These kinds of jokes are why the experts held off so long on releasing probes to civilian."

07:18:53 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Prob so."

08:30:31 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:30:41 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:30:41 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:30:47 The starship has left a unique area of space.

08:30:51 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

08:33:39 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's a big system."

09:00:42 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

09:11:27 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

09:22:05 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

09:23:20 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Pierre."

09:23:25 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sweet dreams Pierre."

09:32:22 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

09:32:48 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

09:32:58 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

10:02:48 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

10:13:05 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

10:23:24 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

10:33:42 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

10:35:14 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

10:35:24 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

11:05:15 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

11:15:25 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

11:23:09 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

11:24:39 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

11:33:32 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

11:35:35 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

11:35:45 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

11:40:17 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't forget to clean the mess."

11:40:21 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

11:40:23 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What mess?"

11:40:35 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll let that one go."

11:40:40 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh..."

12:05:35 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

12:16:04 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

12:26:18 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

12:29:01 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

12:36:45 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

12:36:55 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

13:06:46 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

13:17:02 The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.

13:20:29 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

13:24:00 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

13:32:59 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

13:33:12 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

13:33:12 This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of soft dark pink slippers, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a Tardick lizard named Thor here.

13:34:25 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

13:36:59 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly east.

13:38:42 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

13:38:52 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

13:54:59 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

14:00:30 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

14:08:44 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

14:10:30 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly east.

14:18:51 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

14:19:51 Thuds echo throughout the ship as micrometeorites slam into the hull.

14:30:40 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

14:40:04 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

14:40:15 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

15:10:05 A single tendril of silk wafts over you, glistening with beads of moisture.

15:20:15 Curtains of dangling silk stick to the ship as it pushes through them, obscuring the view from the windows briefly before pulling away.

15:30:39 Curtains of dangling silk stick to the ship as it pushes through them, obscuring the view from the windows briefly before pulling away.

15:31:39 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

15:41:15 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

15:41:26 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

16:11:16 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

16:21:36 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

16:31:58 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

16:32:47 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

16:33:04 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are good."

16:33:10 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Cool."

16:37:54 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well."

16:42:31 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

16:43:01 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

16:43:12 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

16:45:10 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "PLANETS!"

16:46:35 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay well lets do this."

16:46:46 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

16:47:17 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Come show me how to use this thing."

16:47:29 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think Mel's comin up."

16:47:58 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "He needs something for headings."

16:48:02 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sec."

16:48:27 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

16:48:27 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.
The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

16:48:32 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of soft dark pink slippers onto her feet.

17:22:57 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

17:23:16 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Yep. No worries. We're patient."

17:23:18 Morris Corlew waves to you.

17:23:21 You wave to Morris Corlew.

17:23:23 You sit down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:23:38 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:25:26 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

17:25:38 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

17:26:51 Rogue Romano says, "I'm goin' to go rest for a lil' bit."

17:26:57 Rogue Romano slinks south.

17:27:02 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Rest well Rogue."

17:27:16 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks."

17:27:38 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

17:28:10 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Looks like I got a Higgins to snuggle with."

17:28:18 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

17:29:30 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

17:31:29 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

17:34:59 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

17:39:45 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

17:41:37 Morris Corlew puts a metallic silver curiously moulded widget on Morris Corlew's workbench.

17:41:49 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

17:43:35 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

17:43:41 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:43:45 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

17:45:11 The breeze abruptly changes direction, causing the tall grass to stir slightly.

17:55:33 The clouds overhead rapidly change shape in the wind.

17:57:41 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

18:22:23 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

18:24:11 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

18:24:13 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

18:30:48 The breeze abruptly changes direction, causing the tall grass to stir slightly.

18:31:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

18:34:05 The clouds overhead rapidly change shape in the wind.

18:34:05 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

18:34:28 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

18:35:05 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

18:35:55 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

18:35:57 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

18:36:01 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

18:41:50 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

18:42:13 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

18:44:06 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

18:44:16 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

18:45:00 Rogue Romano strokes a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's bristly hair.

18:45:05 You gag slightly.
You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

18:45:38 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

18:47:13 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

18:48:47 The room begins spinning around you.

18:48:47 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

18:49:28 Damien Goss finishes off a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

18:49:32 Damien Goss gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

18:49:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

18:49:47 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

18:50:01 Damien Goss stands up.

18:50:02 Damien Goss steps south.

18:50:57 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

18:50:58 You hear a wet tearing sound.

18:52:04 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Naps all around in the control room."

18:54:47 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

18:54:47 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

18:55:18 The room begins spinning around you.

18:55:53 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

18:56:06 You begin dry heaving.

18:56:47 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

18:56:54 You hear a wet tearing sound.

18:57:42 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

18:57:43 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki jerks her limbs, springing into the air briefly.

18:57:53 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

18:58:14 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters west.

18:59:35 [MTTS] something: I've gotta say hosts, the descriptions on the frontier are great.

19:02:24 The stage lights flicker briefly.

19:02:40 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Almost there."

19:06:10 You begin dry heaving.

19:06:10 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

19:07:00 You begin dry heaving.

19:07:01 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

19:07:50 The stage lights flicker briefly.

19:08:14 The room begins spinning around you.

19:08:14 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

19:08:33 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

19:08:41 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

19:08:41 A swollen, dying, red star floats here, approximately the size of Earth's entire orbit. Extraordinarily large flares arc lazily through space. It is possible that a handful of planets still survive, unless they orbited near enough to be absorbed by the expanding star.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:09:59 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

19:09:59 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

19:10:04 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

19:10:39 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

19:10:44 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on extended observation."

19:11:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

19:12:02 Rogue Romano slinks south.

19:15:00 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

19:15:41 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

19:19:14 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

19:19:59 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

19:21:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:24:59 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

19:25:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:25:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:25:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:25:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:27:34 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

19:27:39 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 6340-6606 I on close approach."

19:27:57 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

19:28:02 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 6340-6606 I on extended observation."

19:29:42 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 6340-6606 I on close approach received."

19:29:44 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki works her fangs.

19:30:08 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

19:31:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

19:35:14 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters south.

19:37:42 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:39:42 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

19:43:42 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

19:55:01 Eli Grey waves.

19:55:04 Eli Grey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

19:55:17 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of hot black coffee.

19:55:19 Eli Grey dashes south.

19:55:36 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the east.

19:55:40 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

19:55:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:55:43 Cheri Lindbergh retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot ramen with vegetables in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into her mouth.

19:55:47 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yummy."

19:55:55 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Except."

19:55:57 Cheri Lindbergh removes a pair of black chopsticks from a black leather backpack with a brushed steel buckle.

19:56:02 Cheri Lindbergh takes a bite of a serving of hot ramen with vegetables in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

19:57:10 Eli Grey walks in from the south.

19:57:14 Eli Grey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

19:57:18 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

19:57:28 Eli Grey empties a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar into an empty white coffee cup with purple accents.

19:57:40 Eli Grey gives an empty white coffee cup with purple accents to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

19:57:45 Eli Grey sighs.

19:57:53 Eli Grey asks, "Can he give that back?"

19:58:41 Eli Grey asks, "Tegan give cup?"

19:58:45 Eli Grey sighs.

19:59:38 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Uh oh."

19:59:46 Cheri Lindbergh takes several bites of a serving of hot ramen with vegetables in a small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.

20:00:02 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Was it a special cup?"

20:00:06 Eli says to Cheri, "Any way to get him to spit it out, it didn't sound like it got crunched ior anything."

20:00:17 Eli says to Cheri, "Yes, my rift duplicate dropped it."

20:00:18 Cheri says to Eli, "I never saw her spit anything out."

20:00:44 Eli Grey says, "I guess when I filled it, I trhew the other cup away without realizing it."

20:00:48 Eli Grey snaps his fingers.

20:05:28 Eli Grey says, "Maybe that wasn't he right cup, it didn't look really any different from a regular cup."

20:05:36 Eli rummages though a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

20:08:49 Eli Grey sighs.

20:08:49 Eli Grey walks south.

20:15:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:19:14 Cheri Lindbergh retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of the bowl and slurps them up.

20:19:15 Cheri Lindbergh shrugs.

20:19:24 Cheri clacks her chopsticks together.

20:19:27 Cheri Lindbergh tips the bowl into her mouth and drinks the richly flavored broth, finishing it off.

20:19:42 Cheri wipes her chopsticks on her skirt.

20:19:49 Cheri Lindbergh puts a pair of black chopsticks in a black leather backpack with a brushed steel buckle.

20:20:36 Cheri licks her skirt.

20:31:42 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

20:38:15 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

20:38:17 Luja Garland waves.

20:38:23 Luja Garland says, "Hello."

20:38:30 Luja Garland presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

20:38:34 Luja Garland says, "Ohh. Planet."

20:38:38 Luja Garland steps south.

20:47:05 Eli Grey walks in from the south.

20:47:27 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

20:51:18 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

20:51:22 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:51:54 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Figure we have two stops before recharge depending on how long it takes to find something else."

20:52:14 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:52:14 Morris Corlew lopes south.

20:52:36 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

20:52:37 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:52:46 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Then again Melinda said a bit over a day before we found this planet."

20:53:24 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Yep. We've got eight and a half cycles of charge currently, which is over a day and a half. That'll drop a bit once we get movin."

20:53:43 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Sorry, a bit under a day and a half."

20:59:43 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

21:10:11 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How does that timer look, Morris."

21:10:20 Morris Corlew glances down at his mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

21:10:43 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on extended observation received."

21:10:47 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Huh. Well she said somethin like 40 minutes about 45 ago, but she did say giv-there it is."

21:10:56 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "One more to go?"

21:11:22 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "I'd nodded off when ya launced 'em, so not sure what all ya launched."

21:12:08 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Library says that close approach study was done planetary wise."

21:12:31 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Who launched 'em?"

21:12:38 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rogue."

21:13:18 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What you think, give it ten minutes then rift?"

21:14:00 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ah."

21:14:17 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I guess we can wait ten minutes."

21:14:42 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "She said two were launced in the post, I've only seen one come back. I'd just wait till it comes back."

21:15:17 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright."

21:16:41 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Any way to see how many are left?"

21:16:54 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Should be just the one. She said two, one has come back."

21:17:03 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I mean in the racks."

21:19:35 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wonder if that was the extended probe that was sent on the system."

21:20:31 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "I think they both maybe were? There's only been one come back."

21:20:51 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hm."

21:21:20 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well we are in no hurry."

21:21:26 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Just gonna have to wait on it. Don't wanna waste a probe. Rogue might remember how long they were supposed to take."

21:21:48 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I fired the first system one and that was supposed to take two hours."

21:21:59 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ah. Any idea what time it was?"

21:23:45 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Melinda made report at 1730."

21:24:01 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Yep. Still, no idea how long that other one took, so dunno."

21:24:02 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small gold dragonflies, a pair of skinny white low rise jeans, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fu
21:24:02 chsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

21:24:09 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

21:24:25 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Guess I will come grab a sandwich."

21:24:33 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

21:24:34 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

21:24:42 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

21:24:46 Vernos Bailey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

21:24:48 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

21:24:49 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Yep. Computer announces all over, so don't have to babysit it up there unless ya wanna."

21:25:22 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

21:25:26 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

21:25:31 Vernos Bailey carefully unwraps a meatball sandwich.

21:25:35 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

21:26:55 Vernos Bailey picks up half of a meatball sandwich and takes a huge bite.

21:27:49 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

21:27:57 Vernos Bailey says, "No news is good news. I hope."

21:28:04 Morris Corlew nods.

21:28:08 Vernos Bailey takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

21:28:43 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to Planetary System 6340-6606 I on extended observation received."

21:28:48 Morris Corlew says, "There it is."

21:28:50 Morris Corlew gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

21:28:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Okay."

21:29:01 Vernos Bailey says, "Going to go start us up."

21:29:01 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

21:29:01 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

21:29:21 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:29:31 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:29:32 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:29:34 The starship has left a unique area of space.

21:29:41 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

21:29:54 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

21:29:59 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

21:30:02 Morris Corlew says, "Hey, flow changed on us. Nice."

21:30:09 Vernos Bailey says, "Yup."

21:30:23 Vernos Bailey says, "That is always nice to see."

21:30:29 Morris Corlew nods.

21:30:31 Vernos Bailey finishes off half of a meatball sandwich.

21:31:39 Vernos Bailey says, "That is some nice speed."

21:31:43 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:32:39 Morris Corlew says, "Gettin bette."

21:34:00 Vernos Bailey taps a red metachannel FTL communicator.

21:34:15 Vernos Bailey says, "Jacob."

21:34:27 Morris Corlew asks, "Huh?"

21:34:48 Eli Grey says, "Weird."

21:34:58 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, comms showing him as currencys."

21:35:03 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

21:35:18 Morris Corlew says, "Currancys. I have...no clue what that is, but saw it earlier today."

21:35:19 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:35:43 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:35:51 Vernos Bailey says, "Wonder if it comes with a decent story."

21:35:56 Morris Corlew says, "Probly not."

21:35:59 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:36:01 Morris Corlew says, "Just kiddin."

21:37:17 Eli Grey says, "Maybe he's currency now.. Like foks can trade him for goods if they catch im."

21:37:22 Eli Grey grins.

21:37:26 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:37:28 Vernos Bailey says, "It just changed."

21:37:33 Vernos Bailey taps a red metachannel FTL communicator.

21:37:50 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Huh."

21:38:03 Eli Grey asks, "Your good?"

21:38:08 Eli Grey says, "That's..."

21:38:11 Morris Corlew says, "I have no idea."

21:38:14 Vernos Bailey says, "I check the info coming off the QE comm a lot."

21:38:18 Luja Garland glances down at her watch momentarily.

21:38:21 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey. "Me too."

21:38:22 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:38:41 Eli Grey asks, "So it's saying htat Jacob is our good?"

21:38:44 Eli scratches his head.

21:38:50 Morris Corlew says, "Don't ask me."

21:41:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Lordy I hope he hasnt done something funky."

21:41:58 Morris Corlew shrugs. "Who knows."

21:42:20 Vernos Bailey says, "Still over 1650 lightyears to go to even find out."

21:42:29 Morris Corlew grins.

21:43:33 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.
Vernos Bailey strolls south.

21:43:43 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

21:43:44 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

21:43:46 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

21:43:52 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

21:44:47 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

21:44:53 Luja Garland switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

21:44:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Just a charge notation."

21:44:58 Eli Grey glances at his metallic silver touch einrophone and checks his missed calls.

21:45:03 Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:45:04 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

21:45:15 Vernos Bailey says, "Just so it is noted for reference."

21:45:23 Morris Corlew says, "Easy enough to check."

21:46:04 Luja Garland switches a message board reader off.

21:49:45 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:50:45 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

21:53:45 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:58:00 Eli Grey lies down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

21:58:03 Eli Grey rolls around on the ground.

21:58:07 Nissi Valdaire stretches.

21:58:10 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:58:13 Eli Grey sits up onto a soft square brown floor cushion.

21:58:17 Luja Garland says, "Hi, Nissi."

21:58:17 Morris Corlew looks at Eli Grey thoughtfully.

21:58:31 Nissi Valdaire switches a metallic purple swivel einrophone off.

21:58:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

21:58:44 Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

21:58:49 Lily Kaise says, "Hey."

21:59:00 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:59:03 Morris says to Nissi, "Total should be 37 now I think."

21:59:19 Nissi Valdaire says, "Cool."

21:59:22 Morris Corlew nods.

22:00:37 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:00:38 Lily Kaise glides east.

22:01:00 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

22:01:03 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

22:01:06 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:01:17 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:01:21 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

22:01:26 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

22:01:35 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

22:01:44 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:03:03 [MTTS] something: From an ooc standpoint, I find the person who's titles keep changing when they misspell things slightly amusing mostly cause I can relate to messing up spelling, but I was wondering how we should treat it in character?

22:03:45 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:04:12 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

22:04:15 Lily Kaise finishes off a cup of hot cafe mocha.

22:04:28 Lily Kaise gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:05:44 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:07:19 [MTTS] atherj: You can make fun of their horrible speech if you feel so inclined! Otherwise, feel free to just ignore it.

22:07:45 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:07:50 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

22:08:22 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

22:11:33 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

22:14:25 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

22:24:36 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

22:26:09 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life 
22:26:09 and round rocks, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Aisling the Fox is dozing on a round saffron orange zafu. Ather Jammoa and Nissi Valdaire are sitting on a white leather sofa. Anfisa the Wanderer, Jason Rat, and Cheri Lindbergh are dozing on a white leather sofa. Eli Grey is sitting on a soft square brown floor cushion. Morris Corlew is sitting on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow. Luja Garland is sitting comfortably cross-legged on a floor pillow. Vernos Bailey is sitting on a silky indigo cushion. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

22:30:20 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

22:30:20 Ather Jammoa strides east.

22:30:37 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

22:30:48 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

22:30:53 Ather Jammoa strides in from the east.

22:30:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Eww."

22:30:57 Ather Jammoa gives a hot cheeseburger with the works to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:30:58 Ather Jammoa strides east.

22:31:05 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

22:31:35 Luja Garland asks, "What's eww?"

22:31:39 Eli Grey says, "Guess he didn't like the burger."

22:32:04 Eli Grey says, "Maye it was really old on the table or something."

22:32:06 Eli Grey shrugs.

22:32:11 Ather Jammoa strides in from the east.

22:32:13 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

22:32:13 Morris says to Ather Jammoa, "What was wrong with the burger?"

22:32:46 Ather Jammoa says, "I don't like pickles."

22:32:51 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

22:32:56 Morris Corlew says, "Part of the works."

22:32:57 Morris Corlew grins.

22:33:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, anyone knows that a normal cheeseburger is far far superior without pickles."

22:33:20 Ather Jammoa says, "Works shouldn't include pickles."

22:33:38 Morris Corlew says, "Of course it should. Because pickles are far superior to many things."

22:33:55 Ather says to Morris, "See? No wonder I think you're a nutjob most of the time. It's not only your felo obsession."

22:34:13 Morris says to Ather, "My felo obsession?"

22:34:38 Morris says to Ather, "Would that be my having an issue with animal cruelty?"

22:34:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, felo don't count."

22:34:57 Morris Corlew asks, "Is that so?"

22:35:05 Morris Corlew asks, "Do lizards count?"

22:35:08 Ather Jammoa asks, "What, you thought I'd change my mind?"

22:35:09 Ather Jammoa chortles.

22:35:12 Morris says to Ather, "Nope."

22:35:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

22:36:01 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Anyway, I got grandly superior non-pickle dish!"

22:36:05 Ather Jammoa retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into his mouth.

22:36:10 Morris Corlew laughs.

22:37:45 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:42:43 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

22:42:52 Ather hmms.

22:42:57 Ather Jammoa says, "I think the ship is about to explode woo."

22:43:01 Morris Corlew says, "Heh."

22:43:45 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

22:47:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:51:45 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:59:24 Vernos Bailey starts in on the second half of a meatball sandwich.

23:00:01 Vernos Bailey takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

23:00:39 A shoal of silver scaled fished, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

23:00:48 Morris Corlew smiles.

23:07:45 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:09:39 Luja Garland stands up.

23:09:40 Luja Garland says, "I've to sleep."

23:09:43 Luja Garland says, "See you tomorrow."

23:09:56 Luja Garland waves.

23:09:56 Luja Garland steps south.

23:10:36 Vernos Bailey finishes off the last of a meatball sandwich.

23:11:00 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

23:11:17 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Rest well Luja."

23:11:58 Vernos Bailey gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Aisling the Fox.

23:12:24 Jason says to Vernos, "Why does she want your trash?"

23:12:55 Vernos Bailey says, "I forgot yours too."

23:12:59 Vernos Bailey says, "Shit."

23:14:55 Jason Rat says, "I still don't get why she wants your trash."

23:15:45 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:15:57 Vernos Bailey says, "We've pretty much all been writing crap on empty wrappers and giving it to folks who are out of it. Who am I to break with this tradition."

23:16:14 Vernos Bailey shrugs.

23:16:28 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

23:16:34 Jason Rat says, "No one has given me one, and I've never seen anyone do it."

23:16:37 Jason Rat shrugs.

23:17:33 Jason Rat says, "Just don't give people your nasty trash if they are sleeping."

23:17:44 Vernos Bailey says, "I've had it done to me twice, melinda once...eli once or so."

23:18:11 Vernos Bailey says, "Not sure but I think ather had it done to him."

23:18:36 Jason says to Morris, "Have you heard of this?"

23:19:05 "Off the top of my head?" Morris Corlew shrugs. "Don't remember seein it."

23:19:13 Jason Rat nods.

23:19:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh whatever."

23:19:31 Morris Corlew says, "Seen a few dropped with kinda rude messages, but..."

23:19:32 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:19:45 Vernos Bailey says, "Well mine was far from rude."

23:20:09 Vernos Bailey says, "It says something like I ate this just to write on it or something like that."

23:20:11 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

23:20:11 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:20:17 Morris Corlew waves to Sarah Bellamy.

23:20:30 Sarah Bellamy waves.

23:20:32 Sarah Bellamy smiles.

23:20:40 Sarah Bellamy stretches.

23:21:15 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

23:21:25 Sarah Bellamy bebops east.

23:21:26 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:22:12 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the east.

23:22:12 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:22:16 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

23:22:22 Morris Corlew squeezes Sarah Bellamy affectionately.

23:22:25 Sarah Bellamy beams.

23:22:28 Sarah Bellamy takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

23:22:33 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

23:22:47 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

23:22:57 You smile at Lily Kaise.

23:22:58 You kiss Lily Kaise.

23:23:09 Vernos Bailey says, "All I know is its some bullshit that it finally gets said something when I do it."

23:23:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

23:23:37 Lily Kaise kisses you.

23:23:42 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

23:23:48 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

23:23:50 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hey it's time to party!"

23:23:53 Lily Kaise grins.

23:23:57 You grin.

23:24:10 Sarah Bellamy glances at Vernos Bailey.

23:24:20 Vernos Bailey says, "Just don't write a joke on a wrapper and give it to someone."

23:24:39 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

23:24:42 Lily Kaise says, "As they say... be careful what you wish for."

23:24:44 Sarah Bellamy says, "Boy did I ever miss somethin."

23:24:47 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

23:24:50 Lily Kaise chuckles.

23:24:51 Morris says to Sarah, "Not really."

23:24:57 Sarah says to Morris, "Okay."

23:25:20 Sarah Bellamy takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

23:25:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Not really Sarah."

23:25:45 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

23:26:44 Sarah Bellamy takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

23:26:51 You smile at Lily Kaise.

23:27:05 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

23:27:17 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:27:18 Lily Kaise glides south.

23:30:31 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:30:31 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

23:30:36 I don't understand that.

23:30:38 I see no "lily" here.

23:32:48 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

23:32:59 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

23:33:36 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All these sleepy lizards."

23:33:39 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

23:33:41 Lily Kaise glides east.

23:33:58 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

23:34:39 Lily Kaise glides west.

23:34:46 Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

23:34:46 Lily Kaise glides south.

23:36:02 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:36:22 
[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Recreation]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a folding gaming table, a sheet of red paper, a portable hot tub, and a beige plastic box labeled 'Paints & Games' here.
You can go east.

23:37:45 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:37:49 I don't understand that.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

23:39:00 Morris Corlew grins.

23:39:32 Sarah Bellamy says, "Well, penny for your thoughts is what they said when pennies existed. I just modified it to be our current currency."

23:51:13 Melinda Michaels asks, "What did it say?"

23:51:17 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

23:51:31 Morris Corlew says, "Thought it said somethin like I ate this just so I could write on the wrapper."

23:51:31 Vernos Bailey says, "I was trying to be funny but jason didnt like my wrapper."

23:51:43 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh dear I could so go there."

23:53:36 Melinda says to Lily, "Yeah."

23:54:20 Lily Kaise grins at you.

23:54:43 Sarah Bellamy takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

23:54:49 Vernos Bailey says, "I just threw it away and kept going."

23:54:55 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

23:56:44 I don't understand that.

23:56:44 Lily Kaise says, "Who doesn't have a seastar and would like one? I found another with a yellow Seastar."

23:56:52 You are carrying nothing.

23:57:01 Morris says to Jason, "No?"

23:57:16 Morris says to Jason, "Why?"

23:57:23 Jason says to Vernos, "Dude, chill. I just thought it was odd you were giving my girlfriend your trash while she was dozing. It's also strange you would put that kind of note. I stopped forever ago, and you kept going."

23:57:34 Sarah says to Morris, "I'll see you in a bit, I've had breakfast but I'm not awake all the way."

23:57:54 Morris Corlew nods to Sarah Bellamy.

23:59:11 Jason Rat nods to Melinda Michaels.

23:59:41 Morris Corlew asks, "What's wrong with raisin an eyebrow?"
