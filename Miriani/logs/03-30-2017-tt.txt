Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a set of
lavender silk sheets on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug,
a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a pair of white socks, a soft red heather cotton
polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, a pair of white cotton briefs, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and a pair of tan
suede clogs here.
You can go out.

Subject: a couple of exploration thoughts
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 23:50 25 March 2317 GST

Having recently been involved in a trip gone sideways thanks to the outsiders, I
thought that I might toss up a few observations.
1. Make sure you have been advised on proper evasion methods. While I was
advised, putting it into practice for the first time was challenging and a bit
nerve-rattling.
2. Space is big and you never know if you will happen upon a not so friendly
fleet of ships. Therefore, if you have a large ship, crew it. If you don't want
a good-sized crew, take a smaller ship out.
3. If you are new at this wonderful thing we call exploration, take a good mix
of experienced pilots and those wanting to learn. If you get into a rough
situation, experienced pilots may be able to assist better than a ship full of
new pilots who don't yet know the ropes. Doing this could also give those who
don't know the chance to learn.
4. Don't set yourself up with a ship full of drama. I've done this and it can
make for a long, rough trip. Having a happy crew who gets along makes for a
better time out in space.
While I don't proclaim to be the most experienced pilot out there, these are the
things that I have found to be important for a good, safer trip. Feel free to
add your own thoughts, yell at me or whatever.

Yes.
Yes to all of this.
Except for maybe that last one, it can be more exciting to place bets on how
some drama is going to unfold.

Subject: industrial trip and roids

Starting April 12 a roid station will be open 90 light years south of the
Campeche beacon on a heading of 270 0. the station will last about 11 days and
this trip will have a beacon at the field itself and a beacon and recharge
station at 45 light years between campeche and the roid field to help keep
people on track and help if there are charge issues going down or coming back.
I'll also setup a return beacon just south of campeche for the return trip. I
will setup all the beacons early and post names to help on the trip. I hope
people will take time and come down and work some out of com's roids for a few
days.

Hi Love, Our Scooping station will go offline in about 21 hours. It is now just
after midnight on 3/30/2317. I have assembled the station so all that is
required is to please go deploy it in Olivia's Pearl. You will need to be
certain that the old station has gone offline prior to deployment of the new
Scooping station, or you won't be able to deploy the new Scooping station. If
you don't get to it, I'll deploy it after I come back into work later today or
tomorrow morning. It's just a good idea to keep the scooping active though as
our megacredits are really being depleted. I was hoping that this would be the
last time we had to use the lowest level Scoop but we'll be 22 Command short of
500 which is the requirement for the next Scoop The next level Scoop will yield
us 3 Megacredits per day versus 2 Megacredits per day. Still, it's something and
we're not really suffering just yet, It's just been awhile since I've seen our
balance depleted to this level. From the Range Office, I see that there will be
another 5 or 6 stations which will need replacement which we contribute to so
there goes another 10-12 Megacretis. we will get 32 when this current scoop goes
offline though so this should increase our available Megacredits to over 100
once more. Thank you for your help. I love you, - Lily

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star
on the side and quickly don them.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Be aware
that travel to the Radio Bubble at 287 or the asteroid processor out of comms at

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense
device here.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
