15:26 Mary the droid

15:26 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
It is powered up and looks alert.
It is not wearing a top. It is not wearing a bottom.
It is carrying nothing.

15:32 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Zander; Lukco Robotics Landing Platform.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.

15:35 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:35 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:36 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

15:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

15:36 You peer out and see...

15:36 [51 Pegasi Ba; Landing Pad]
A landing pad with a very light amount of activity. The occasional starship lands or launches and there is very little activity on the pad itself with only the occasional arrival of a repair crew to fix a damaged ship. Off the landing pad in varying directions are the standard starship services you'd expect to find. A small road extends to the south.
You see Pawsome the droid here.

15:36 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

15:36 You stand up.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

15:56 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.
You can go south and out.

A mixture of the smell of food along with the scent of chlorine from the pool fills the air. A set of wooden stairs leads back down to the wrap around porch while a wooden door leads into the bar.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

17:10 #$#soundpack_pong

17:10 #$#soundpack_lag 109

17:10 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "Because she saw you and Matt hang out at the very beginning, and now she believes that you and Matt are no longer together. So... I don't know.

17:14 [Private | Amore Carver] You transmit, "I think what she fails to take into consideration is that a lot of communication happens via private comms and therefore, we don't have to say much, if anything, over public comms.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, how
17:25 ever, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Ren
17:25 ame
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cannot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access to the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

17:27 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.
You can go south and out.

Architectural Design Simulators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Architectural design simulators allow you to build and customize property to add to the game. Through a holographic avatar of yourself, you can configure and customize a blueprint to your liking. All building commands work inside a blueprint, and no charge is incurred for your character in reality.

  Getting Started
Once you have purchased an architectural design simulator, you should BOLT it down and USE it. You will be presented with a number of options, most prominently to create, edit, or delete a blueprint. To get started, choose 'Create Blueprint' and follow the prompts.
First, you will be asked for a name. This name should be indicative of what you wish your completed area to be called. It cannot have punctuation save for hyphens, and it will appear before each room name when you are in the area itself. Once you have decided on a name, you will arrive in a menu of choices for which real estate you wish to simulate. If you are building this property for yourself, pick what type of structure it should be upon finalization. If you are building this area for eventual inclusion in the game's global geographics, choose house. Be sure that you have spoken with a host prior to building an area for general inclusion, as you will need permission to add a public area to a pre-built planet.  Public areas should be thematically appropriate and not offer exclusive benefits to the person creating it. If your simulator is bolted in a private structure that you are an owner of, you will also be presented with the option to import it in as a new design. This may be useful for experimenting with possible new additions to your current structure. Submissions of imported designs will not, however, usually be accepted. If you wish to update your current design, you need to build it by hand.
Finally, you will be asked if you want to password protect this blueprint. If other people have access to the simulator and you do not want them modifying the design, choose yes and enter a password. Passwords are encrypted one-way, so if you forget your password, it cannot be read or recovered by a host. Keep this in mind when adding a password.

  Building
Once you have finished configuring your blueprint, you will be connected to a holographic avatar. Your avatar is naked, and thus lacks a communicator, message board reader or other gadgets. You can use the NEWBIE channel or the DESIGN channel. The design channel is IC and allows you to speak to any other avatars that may be connected to the blueprint. It should not be used to circumvent communicators.
Most building commands work inside of a blueprint. For more detail on these, review HELP BUILDING COMMANDS. You cannot create or submit stores inside of a blueprint, nor can you access authorization lists or use security center functions. Similarly, holographic avatars can move through any biometrically locked exit without requiring authorization. There are some commands that are exclusive to building avatars, which are listed below.

DESIGN <text | who> - Speak on the design channel. This channel employs minimal filtration and is for conversing about your design with other avatars that may be connected. It should remain in character. Providing the [who] argument will show other avatars that are connected to your design.
@DESCRIBE/DESCRIBE <object | here> as <text> - Describe <object>. Using "here" as the object will describe the room you are standing in. If you wish to have a multi-line description, use the syntax DESCRIBE <object> by itself instead.
CREATE <name> - Create a custom item. Custom items can be props, containers or furniture and there is a limit; 5 for a house, 10 for a space station, 15 for a moon and 20 for a planet. Each item will add 5,000,000 credits to the final cost of the blueprint.
DESTROY <item> - Destroy an item. This is not reversible.
DIG-GO <exit name> to <room> - Digs a go exit with the provided name. If you don't provide a name, the room name will default to "New Room".
DEMOLISH-GO <go exit> - Demolishes a go exit. The other side must not have any connecting rooms.
ENVIRONMENT (or ENV) - Alter the environment of a room.
EXIT-MESSAGES (or EXITMSG) <exit> - Set messages that are shown when moving 
17:35 through an exit. Pronouns and other substitutions can be used here.
PRONOUNS - Show a list of pronouns that can be used in various messages.
LIGHTING (or LIGHTS) - Turn lighting on or off in a room. Rooms that are not lit will not show descriptions or contents.
DOORTYPE - Change the door type for an entrance accessible with the ENTER-command. You must be standing in the room with the entrance.
ROOMFIX (or DEMOLISH HERE) - Remove a room that has no exits, go exits, or enter exits and move your avatar back to the first room of the blueprint.
ROOMS - View all rooms in your blueprint.
WORTH - View a cost breakdown for the entire blueprint. This is how much you will need to pay once you wish to make this design a reality.
ZAP (or TELEPORT) <room name> - Instantly transport your avatar to <room name>.
ADDNOTE <text> - Add notes for a specific room. Notes can be deleted or reviewed through the manage notes function when modifying your blueprint. You should leave a note in the room that you wish to set as a docking bay or landing pad if you are making anything other than a house.
END - Terminates the simulation.

  Further Customization
The second option in the initial menu allows one to edit blueprint parameters. If your blueprint is password protected, you will need the password to access and change settings.

Change Parent - Change the type of structure that governs your design.
Enable/Disable Map - Toggle specific mapping on your blueprint. This defines whether people can type MAP [room] to receive directions to a specific room.
Rename - Change the name of a blueprint.
Add/Change Password - Change an existing password. If you have not set a password, this option will guide you through adding one. If you wish to clear the password, type the old password and then leave the new password field blank.
Manage Notes - Add or delete attached notes. Notes should detail special accommodations for your structure such as lifts and should also include where you wish to place it in the real game world.
Set Sector Coordinates - Set coordinates for a private station, moon, or planet. These will be the coordinates that your new structure occupies in the sector once it has been physically built.

  Submitting Blueprints
Once you have finished your blueprint, you should submit it. Keep in mind that you cannot submit a design if you lack the points to own it. Submission can be done through the simulator menu and puts your design in a queue for hosts to review. While your blueprint is in the queue you will not be able to access or modify it. Once it has been approved, a host will approach you to take payment and implement your design into the world. Be sure to include painful amounts of detail in the notes attached, lest it not be done exactly how you intended.

Well if that's the only fun she has in her life, then she should go for it, nothing she say or do can make me become a bitch, or meen spirited, I enjoy my life, and if that bothers her, she should get one of her own."

17:59 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.

This quaint store has been decorated with the finest kitten wallpaper. Thick wooden shelves, coated in layers of ancient dust, display chipped and faded saucers depicting various breeds of kittens. Faded pink trim along the ceiling droops in ragged strips in the corners, occasionally giving way completely to spots of water damage. A few broken shelves contain dusty ink pads and several old desks are brimming with old stamps that overflow from the drawers. An old wooden rocking chair sits in the corner of the room, the only thing that doesn't have at least a minor coating of dust on its surface. A small antique table beside the chair holds a stained fish bowl full of hard candies.

18:24 A piece of pastel-purple stationery with a wave border

Tibo,
you have to understand that I am a rather private person. What you said in that mis-com was a bit insightful in that you were saying something to cause Amore to be judgemental by saying 'kitty is refusing thus far'. You only brought up being friends this evening and I never refused that so that's not being fair don't you think? I jus feel that if friends are there to help us both then they should be mutual friends and I don't consider Amore to be a mutual friend as she has not done anything but communicate with just you. Therefore, she is only hearing just your side of the issues. So all you had to say when I asked the first time that you request that amore stay out of our affairs, then you could have come back and said that she was encouraging you to work with me. Then I would certainly be more trusting of her motives. In truth, we do have to be best friends too if we're going to grow into another phase. Friends trust one another and friends have your back. Lovers don't always have those qualities. If all that I can have with you is friendship, then I am willing to be that even though I won't stop loving you. I will just have to keep my feelings to myself. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy sex though as you don't have to love me to have sex with me. I enjoy it with you so I'm willing to accept your sudden change of heart.
As for traveling out to get our ships, I will be very grateful to have your assistance. Also, I 
18:24 am still willing to do additional traveling to help you earn more artifacting points and your Radio Receiver components. I have traveled before with friends and I do enjoy working with you in this respect.
Your friend,
Kitty

18:26 The starship is already moving.

18:26 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:26 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:26 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

18:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

18:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

This large laboratory is spotlessly clean and starkly white. Tube lights in the ceiling cast harsh light throughout the area, and there is not a shadow to be found. Long stainless steel tables are neatly arranged in the center of the room, while desks holding an array of genetic equipment line the perimeter. In one corner, a large stack of crates sits, each clearly labeled with its contents, such as petri dishes and test tubes. Projected above the central-most table, a rotating image of a baby can be seen, displaying a rapidly-altered growth process. Within the span of ten seconds, the figure goes from zygote to embryo to fetus to fully-developed child. Every so often, a droid dressed in surgical scrubs trundles in carrying a clipboard, checking up on all of the computer systems and ensuring that the civilians using the equipment don't ruin anything.

Frost-edged mirrors and hazy murals of sensually dressed human figures line the intricately carved walls. The cathedral style ceiling is painted in intermingling swirls of blue and indigo, the colors faded and misted by a light shimmer. Ornate light fixtures with broad arms cast a dim gold light throughout the area. Situated around the space are several exhibits devoted entirely to chocolate. Posted signs invite visitors to sample each variation on display. Immaculately dressed droid attendants glide around, their faces fixed with soft smiles. The quiet music of a soothing piano drifts lightly through the room.

20:13 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.
You can go south and out.

21:25 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

21:25 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Public Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.

21:25 You peer out and see...

21:25 [Empanda Station; Public Garage]
Large robotic arms are constantly in motion transporting starships to and from the overhead docking bay in this cavernous starship garage. The echo from the launching and landing of ships reverberates off the concrete walls, creating a cacophony of sound when combined with the mechanical whirl of the busy sanitation drones that dart among the powered down starships. Blue and white lines have been painted onto the stone floor, serving as markings to keep the ships in some semblance of organization. Every so often, one of the large metallic arms will pick up a starship and transfer it to another area of the garage to optimize the available space.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go south and up.

22:15 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:15 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:15 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

22:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

22:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:17 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
