Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[New Earth; Spaceport East]
This part of the spaceport has a fresh new look. Numerous pilot services are
available from the facilities here, including from the new Unreality Programming
office to the south, where a bold green and white banner announces: 'Employment
Opportunities! Apply inside!' Next to it, the spaceport's ship store competes
with a brand new flashing sign reading: 'Ship Sales! Don't be grounded!' Between
them, nearly hidden behind a potted plant is a wide stairway leading downward to
a lower level of the spaceport. A small sign near the stairway reads: Aerial
Fortresses and Supply. Other areas of interest here are the Fund Center to the
northwest, the pawn shop to the north, and the trading center to the northeast.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The one-person cargo hauler "Tony's Delivery Shuttle", the two-person hardened

[Starship "Shadowsong"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a large leather chair and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north and south.

ftl accord
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Pb=qgbmz(4OFVd@"m,cY(H}oq+W/&p=E,r7oYLxA
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

ftl accord
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

This is an orbital marketplace, connected to others like it through a series of

allowed to operate on planets or large space stations. A computer interface

underneath it allows items to emerge as they are delivered via wormhole.

From a phone-based holoemitter: "Good evening. Our topic for tonight... Last
night's debate, where the candidates were questioned about their space policy
and given a chance to clearly outline their differing positions. The first such
question had to do with the AEU's civilian pilot program."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Have a safe trip space bus
driver."
sit chair
You sit down on a gray leather captain's chair.
From a phone-based holoemitter: The image of President Warren Garner appears. He
says, "It's clear that the civilian pilot program has suffered from a lack of
discipline and leadership. Perhaps we asked too much of civilians, who do not
have the benefit of the intensive training our military receive. Regardless,
it's clear that the actions of the civilian corps, from engaging in human
trafficking to embarrassing us before the Mutuality Council to indulging in
conspiracies about deep space cults, leave us with little choice but to continue
the gradual cessation of the civilian program. Our gap in expeditions will be
made up by a well-equipped, well-trained branch of the navy."
From a phone-based holoemitter: The image changes to show Eric Best. He shakes
his head, then gestures animatedly as he says, "It's all nonsense. The only
problems our civilians have faced is being too worried about what others think
of us. Who cares what the Mutuality or the League think of us? We must make
progress on our own terms. And one thing is clear, the civilian pilot program
has always had tremendous success in bringing in new resources and creating new
wealth, something no branch of the navy is able to match. This idea of
eliminating our civilian pilots is terrible."
From a phone-based holoemitter: The image changes to that of Kaisa Rebane.
"These answers are both extremes. I see no reason why the civilian pilot program
can't continue in much the same way as it is now. Yes, there have been many
unfortunate incidents, and we will have to take care and look closely at the
program before deciding whether to open it to new applicants again. And, yes,
the pilots we have now would certainly need to begin showing some leadership.
But Mr. Best is right, the program brings in incredible wealth, and its
continuation is essential to the health of the economy until a suitable private
sector equivalent emerges."
From a phone-based holoemitter: The image fades into that of the newscaster once
again, who remarks, "The moderator then raised the issue of relations with the
Mutuality, which still have yet to be normalized, which resulted in a fiery
exchange."
From a phone-based holoemitter: President Garner says, "We should strive to have
good relationships with all of our neighbors, and the Mutuality certainly
qualify, in travel time if not in distance. Perhaps when the civilian pilot
program is discontinued, we can convince them to engage with our state
department rather than the civilian corps, and our diplomats can work on
rebuilding that relationship."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We almost
have both performance goals in hand! Keep pushing!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: Mr. Best shakes his head. "Waste of time. Look,
they want nothing to do with us, so why waste time bowing and scraping to them?
We put our tax money into the Accord, tax money that gets spent on defending
Mutuality space, sending rift probes with classified technology to bizarre cult
societies, and even repairing space stations belonging to a completely different
species. What do we get out of that? What have they given us? No more. We need
to look to our own borders. If we empower our civilian program and our navy,
with MILITARY technology, then we'll do great. Things are very bad right now,
but we can do great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "With their
statements, both Garner and Best have made up my mind, I think. Garner will get
us out of a job. Best will keep us in it at the cost of everything I believe in,
cooperation, trying to fix relations with the mutuality regardless how bleak it
all looks. I guess my voting choice is clear, but other choices are not so."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Ms. Rebane responds, "I agree with Mr. Best that
we need to spend our tax money more wisely. Spending less on the Accord
initiative would allow for tax cuts across the board, kicking our economy back
into high gear and giving us the funding we need to subsidize private sector
solutions for bringing in new resources. This so-called Expeditionary Force
would be an expensive boondoggle. But I have to disagree with this blind
empowerment of the civilian corps. A measured, considered approach is best, and
in time, again, I would like to see that program transition to a private
initiative, out of the hands of the government."
From a phone-based holoemitter: The newscaster smiles tightly as she reappears
on the screen. "A stark choice stands before the AEU in regards to its space
program as well as many other issues. Election Day is on Tuesday, November 1st,
less than two weeks away, and the polls are still tight!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: "That's all we have time for today. This has
been the Interstellar Politics Hour, only on ISNN!"

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only

but you'd have to take them out to use them. since you don't type use to use
them, you type repair. verses the tool cases and what not, where you can type
use band, for those tool things, and choose from there. I see them more as
gadgets verses eng tools. they may repair the ship, but both internally and
externally, so the code is a bit different I think. you're not directly
affecting a percentage like your hull or turrets, or energy. at least not a
number we can see. at any rate.

since I'm in an exceedingly curious mood. for those long stretches of time
you're in the rift. what do you do in rl to pass the time? for me, long rift
trips, or rift trips in general let me catch up on reading, be it books, or
fanfiction. or rarely, video game playing. what do you guys do to pass the days,
hours, or even minutes in the rift?

Hi,
Unfortunately I also can not see the sketches, but I find it very cool that
people are drawing SC related things, and it seems people do enjoy it. Cool!

I truly admire those with enough sight to be artistic. I am unable to enjoy the
sketches so raved about in this thread, but I hope the artist does keep up the
good work and if I had the eyesight, I'm sure I would enjoy your work as well. I
have always wanted to make my own art but sadly, no matter how well I try to
visualize things enough to put them on paper or sculpt them in clay, people have
a difficult time identifying what I've drawn or sculpted, which kind of doesn't
feel so great, so I kind of gave up on the whole artsy thing several years ago.
So keep drawing, keep sculpting, whatever you do.

listen to what I said, Lily. I will never support Best."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "At first he sounded,
interesting, encouraging. But the AEU can not stand alone. It is what he wants.
He wants us to remain alone, divided, stop trying to cooperate with the
Mutuality, the accord, or maybe anyone who costs too much money or does not like
something we do or say."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How did we drive the
outsiders off, though be it temporarily. Did we do it, we AEU people? Or did we

[Hyperwave Relay] Epiphany at Down and Slightly East from the Torus relay
transmits, "Going on short trip into unknown to explore. Will try to keep in
hypercaster range. Have fun."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "Have fun, Epiphany."
[Hyperwave Relay] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, good luck and enjoy yourself."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "What class vessel are you?"
[Hyperwave Relay] Epiphany at Down and Slightly East from the Torus relay
transmits, "Sightseer. It is Aisling."
[Hyperwave Relay] Kim Saunders transmits, "Travel safe aisling."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "Your hypercaster range won't be all
that much. Maybe six light-years at best."
[Hyperwave Relay] Epiphany at Down and Slightly East from the Torus relay
transmits, "Oh well!"
[Hyperwave Relay] Epiphany at Down and Slightly East from the Torus relay
transmits, "I am used to such big ships. My heading is 5, -80 from Torus."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "You catch that latest episode of the
Interstellar Politics Hour?"
[Hyperwave Relay] Epiphany at Down and Slightly East from the Torus relay
transmits, "I did."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "I wonder if anyone told Rebane that a
transition to a privately run corps is a recipe for better equipped pirates?"
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "They already have trouble with smaller
ships ending up in pirate hands. How much worse would it be with no government
oversight?"
[Hyperwave Relay] Epiphany at Down and Slightly East from the Torus relay
transmits, "Is stupid idea. Basically saying she will phase them out too once
she has method of doing it."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Morning."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "My watch says it is evening,
but, sure, good morning."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Well true, but I did just
awaken."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "My watch says it's the 14th
subcycle of the last cycle of the pentacosacycle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Goodness, why do I
seem to like only Mr. Best's responses so far in this debate?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Long cycle is better."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The "long cycle" is just two
pentacosacycles."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Long live long cycle!"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It isn't even base 25!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You tell us?
Although, I do think I have some idea of that."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "But it makes more sense in
time frames when dealing with reg time frames."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "At least he's
promising future initiatives."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "40 cycles is closer to a week
than 50 cycles."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The other two are
just trying to shut us down, pretty much."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "True, but 50 is technically
divisible by 25."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Rebane basically
wants to continue with the civilian pilot corps until a better private
alternative comes out, and Garner wants to get rid of it and let the navy do
everything. Best at least seems interested in better equipping us with better
tech, and doesn't want to waste time pandering to anyone else. Garner is living
a pipe dream if he really thinks that the mutuality will respond to the navy
pilots for peace talks. They've always said that they refuse to negotiate with
anyone other than civilian pilots."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Anyway. TCT has nothing
close to represent comparable time close to reg week. 50 cycles is pretty close.
Gap between cycle and penta...whatevercycle is too big."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Just use two pentacosacycles."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Meh. I hate word."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Or stick to using the old style
of counting up to 625 cycles."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I also hate my skin peeling
off."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The far superior alternative is
to simply panic. It resolves everything."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs at Ather Jammoa.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hi all."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "That is why AEU pilot league
is doing so well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Can we seriously
pretend that, what the other alliances think of us, how they see us, is
unimportant?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Perhaps not as
unimportant as Mr. Best thinks, but not as important as the other two seem to
believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I am not really
surprised. Best keeps us in our job, and even last year you stated in a meeting
that you did not really see the need of better relations with other alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ather I believe you
have unamymous or nearly so agreement on that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Does anyone know what Mr. Best
meant when he was talking about military technology?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Assume militarizing civilian
fleet. Which I take means focusing on warships."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Let's keep it
up! That second performance goal is nearly ours!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I stand by what
I said earlier, I rather give up this job that I love fighting for what I feel
is right, than continue to support this isolationism the AEU seems to have
fallen victim to. No, we are not that wonderful pilot core we may have once
been, and no, I do not feel we can afford an atitude of we are great and what
other alliances think can be ignored."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
e2qa`D31!c$(h13(blV59?`{f>P)1~}"|H)10SI+
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A patrol recently ran into a bunch of Outsider ships near Beacon A-23.
The fighting's done, but the people in R&D think there might be something to
salvage from the wrecks.
Head out there and pick up 90,000 units from the wrecks and we'll see what we've
got.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
"qb#HwCIoE>uLm\[]Gn]5"9D2^n6}"a:U*s7}t;Y
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2232 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southwest
and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Money Maker" has
docked with League Xenological Salvage Processing Debris-Burning Message Beacon.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Kalliste. Welcome to Accord space."

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

You can go south and out.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
a/`s9iAB!;~f<?X-DxV|*>A&)a]i0K/s~9i3e@]/
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has

l
[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's
chair, and a black leather sofa here.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
7:TE/|[pDSp@xYHfGGNQZYBX{>0x4NTeHBSBO?jw
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heheh, evil little
me can do that. Yeah shule, I wasn't going to move, don't worry."
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup if we aren't
getting hit I might lodge some pot shots now and then."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but

lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in average-length, striped
violet fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth.
The felo's long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked white
claws visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of bright green eyes with
horizontal pupils. It is wearing a sparkling diamond collar and a tiny purple
six-legged spacesuit body. It also has a pair of lavender satin tail ribbons
tied in bows.
