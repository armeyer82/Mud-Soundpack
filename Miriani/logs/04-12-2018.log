["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

20:43 Emissive Energy Scanning Enhancement
--------------------------------------------------
The emissive energy scanning enhancement upgrade allows your ship to detect emissive energy signatures as part of the long-range scanning routine. This means that if a starship is powered up on, say, an asteroid in uncharted space and that asteroid is within range of your long-range sensors, your ship will report the asteroid and the presence of energy signatures on the surface.

20:45 Wormhole Scanner
--------------------------------------------------
This upgrade allows your ship to record important data when you travel through a natural wormhole. To utilize the upgrade, simply locate a natural wormhole (a @ symbol on the starmap), select it when you type MOVE, and say yes to move through it. Your ship will sustain some damage, but if the wormhole is previously undiscovered, a scan should emerge from the console. You can then RESEARCH that scan at any research center in known space.

20:48 Starmap
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  STARMAP [basic | legend | map | coords]
Description:
  The starmap allows you to see everything that is in the current sector. With no arguments, you will see the sector name and who owns it, your galactic coordinates (if you have a GMU installed), the actual map, a rundown of starships in the sector, a rundown of objects in the sector, and your current coordinates. Sometimes this is more information than you actually need. For these times, you can type STARMAP BASIC (or SM B) to get only the map and sector title. If you only wish to see the map with no listing of the ships or objects in the sector, you can type STARMAP MAP (or SM M).
To forego the entire visual map and only see a coordinate listing, you can use the SM COORDS command (or SM CO).
For an explanation of the symbols on the starmap, you can type STARMAP LEGEND (or SM HELP) to see what the symbols on the map are associated with.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras
