You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, a compact silver Lore computer, and a pair of brown leather tennis shoes here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

15:02 This small single-person craft is comprised of two main sections. The main portion of the hull is an elongated sphere, with a pair of wings protruding from either side and a rudder-like tail from the rear. Two small magnetic feet are mounted on the underside, and when in the presence of scoopable materials, they extend on long rods to grab debris, then deposit it in the belly of the craft. Toward the front of the craft, an ovular compartment is set. The compartment slightly resembles a bird's head, with a viewing port wrapping around the front of it toward the top, and where the beak would be, the pilot's legs are kept safe.

16:52 ["Starlight Express" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.

18:03 [General Communication] Salazar Clayton transmits, "A vanguard,yes?"

18:04 [General Communication] Salazar Clayton transmits, "Perhaps instead of fighters,try different classes. Perhaps that is what draws them in."

18:07 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Don't."

18:07 [General Communication] Bradley Kind transmits, "That's a bad idea."

18:07 [General Communication] Erik Yobi transmits, "Anyone who needs a lift to 12 by the way?"

18:10 [General Communication] Bradley Kind transmits, "Excluding my new dif, praelor send forces into easies to make them last longer, jump Kritzn into 12, but what's the purpose. Have ou guys gotten attacked in uncharted? And why would they overwhelm you in uncharted rather than in their own space?"

18:10 [General Communication] Marcus Henderson transmits, "Landing in 36 seconds."

18:10 [General Communication] Cara West transmits, "Trying to distract us maybe?"

18:11 [General Communication] Alissandra Ivonov transmits, "Distraction techniques are always possible. Sperehead strike forces? We just can't tell without advanced sensors."

18:12 [General Communication] Cara West transmits, "Maybe it depends on ships. Ryan and me did a solo in fighters. Thermin went into an easy in a vg. Maybe that has something to do with why he didn't get anything extra."

18:20 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "I think it was more of a distraction, to get us on missions to launch an assault into 12, so that we can't leave the missions without getting diverted."

18:21 [General Communication] Marcus Henderson transmits, "Bradly, want me with you?"

18:21 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "Whatever the route cause. This seems like a new tactic for us to be following."

18:21 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "We fell in it face first too."

18:22 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "But, they must have cloaking, or some kind of sensor jamming tech to make it so we can't see them enter the sector through our sensors."

18:22 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "A scary thought. That cloaking device that the krielia used. Maybe it was captured while we had our attention diverted."

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, a transparent architectural design simulator, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three translucent red security drones, a shiny silver starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood end table, a black rosewood side table, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, a transparent architectur
22:57 al design simulator, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.
You see Miriam Valleris (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.
