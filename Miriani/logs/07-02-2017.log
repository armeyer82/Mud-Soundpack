03:35 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This 22 year old woman stands 4 feet and 8 inches tall and is svelte with a small bust size. She has a dark complexion. She is wearing a decorative silver crystal hair clip shaped like a Sun in her waist-length, raven black hair, which is tumbling down her back in tight silky corkscrew curls. She has almond-shaped violet eyes with a button nose above brilliantly white, crooked teeth.  She appears to have adopted an elusive stance. She is surrounded by a bright energy field.
She has a tattoo of an orange phoenix being born out of flames on her left wrist, a tattoo of a lavender pegasus on her right ankle, a tattoo of a silver flaming dragon on her right upper arm, a tattoo of a sapphire blue flames on her left shoulder, and a tattoo of a friendly teapot on her left lower leg.

The nails on her left hand are painted mirrored silver with suns and adorned with holographic beads of light that flow from nail to nail and the nails on her right hand are painted mirrored silver with suns and adorned with holographic beads of light that flow from nail to nail.
For a top, she is wearing a shimmering lavender silk shoulder-bearing blouse with thin spaghetti straps and silver fringe around the top.

She is wearing a pair of sparkly silver silk strappy heeled sandals with hexagonal copper buckles on her feet. She is wearing a multi-strand silver glass beaded belly chain adorned with tiny dangling clear glass dragons around her waist. She is also wearing a stainless steel necklace with an aquamarine intertwined heart pendant, a white gold necklace with a pendant in the shape of a single Border Collie with topaz eyes, a sterling silver signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, a tiny platinum band engraved with intricate spirals, a silver Commoveo membership ring, a silver charm bracelet, a delicate watch with a silver band and a sun-shaped face, a beaded silver anklet with a tiny puppy charm hanging from it, a softly padded bright yellow snuggly holding a plump golden retriever puppy, a compact sparkly Lore computer, a yellow metafrequency earpiece, a pink and black slime machine, a padded backpack patterned with Yellow Labrador puppies, a purple armor storage bag, a violet flight control scanner, a violet spac

03:43 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

04:29 [General Communication] Kitty Mars transmits, "Hey."

04:30 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

04:30 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Lightning" has launched from Rolukssica.

04:30 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

04:30 [General Communication] Matt Valentino transmits, "Hello."

04:30 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

04:30 [General Communication] Tristina Cantrell transmits, "Oh shut it Mikey. I just woke."

04:30 [AIE | Channel 1] Matt Valentino transmits, "So AIE, any new places to explore out of locals?"

04:30 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Yeah, I'm amused now!"

04:30 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

04:30 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

04:30 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

04:30 [AIE | Channel 1] Tristina Cantrell transmits, "A trip?"

04:30 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

04:30 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Lightning" has initiated an intrasector slip.

04:30 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

04:31 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

04:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Lightning" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

04:31 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

04:31 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

04:31 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

04:31 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

04:31 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

04:31 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

04:31 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

04:31 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

04:31 [AIE | Channel 1] Matt Valentino transmits, "In a transverser."

04:31 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243", and the one-person expediter "Black Lotus" powered down here.

10:36 You don't see that here.

10:36 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

10:36 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

10:36 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the five-person transverser "Star Liner", the six-person sentinel "Crimson Dragon", and the one-person expediter "Skysong" landed here.

You can go south and out.

10:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

10:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

10:36 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

10:37 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

10:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

10:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

10:37 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

10:37 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

10:37 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

10:37 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

10:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

10:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

10:37 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

10:37 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

10:37 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

10:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

10:37 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

10:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

10:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

10:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

10:37 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

10:37 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

10:39 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

10:39 You peer out and see...

10:39 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.
