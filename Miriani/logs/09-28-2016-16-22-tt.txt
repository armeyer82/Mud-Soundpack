Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a small seashell pink trash can, an insulated orange cooler, a
blue plastic food storage container, a clear plastic food storage container, an
insulated green cooler, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a dark pink jeweled leash, Samantha the old hungry large violet
felo, Shasta the big onyx soldier felo, a torchiere with a stained glass shade
depicting three pink and green dragonflies with finely crafted filigree wings on
a golden background (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy gold ceramic felo
chow bowl, a hairy black and red striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Araignée,
a small Bari-shaped tidbit, and a small Bari-shaped tidbit here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

We made 3.43 LTC on course 122 45. Along the way we diverted slightly to visit
Planetary System 5904-4297. This was not one of the systems Reets mentioned in
"Into The Deep". Grade 40 debris, slightly brighter than sol-equivalent
luminosity, three planets.
The Torus NDB locator reported a signal strength of 46%, which is stronger than
it was when I last checked. I'm changing course to 302 45 instead, so that we'll
get back in the right strength band while still covering unseen territory.
Pierre informed me that the strength band we want is between 45% to 40%
exclusive.

We had to stop for minor repairs to the drive. Internal work only, thankfully.
We had covered 11.14 LTC from the previous stop (when we dropped out of the rift
following hearing chains). Pierre didn't record the distance we'd covered prior
to that stop, not that I blame him considering all the excitement after, but he
did mention it was about 4 LTC.
Around 0930 Morris and Evenia contacted us by hypercaster. They had a hard time
getting in touch initially, but I told them to try the 32 6 heading again and
that worked fine. So we're certainly heading where we want to go, at least.

10 LGC after we started back up (maintaining the course last set, 36 -90), we
spotted a site called "Whispering Enervation some 14.6 LGC directly north. The
Torus NDB strength was at 45%, and fairly clear.

Hello. I had a mint green silk photo album with a cream lightning bolt print
entitled "Space Fauna of Spawning Zone 5650-4129" in my hands, and I don't
remember how I got it. I left it on the table in the Forward Observation room,
so the owner can come pick it up.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Forward Observation]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls
at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy
poster of Nouveau Quebec Premier Maxime Roberge giving two thumbs up, a small

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar
and cuffs and a pair of soft light blue slippers. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her head, face, both
eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown
rattan table with a glass top, an interdictor launcher, Nestor the humanoid
service robot, a small natural golden brown trash bin, a cardboard box labeled
'Here be keys', an orange plastic box labeled 'Felo Chow', an efficient round

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sheer dark purple silk chemise. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a light purple linen bag.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

I was not sure how down we were when I woke up. I decided to level the extreme
down heading at 32 -12 but requested transmission from Coreward Reach quickly
determined we were level with it, from very direction signal was received and a
32 0 heading. Since we did not find SLF while diving and signal seemed a bit
strong according to the famous Reets Records, I decided to go back up to that 3
to 6 range on a 32 30 heading for about one LTC. Found we were still too level
so increased it to 32 75 for about third of LTC and then spotted the first
lifeform going northeast and up. Changed heading to 45 65, will change as we
find more. For records, we are still at same or so elevation as Coreward Reach
at time we found lifeform, we caught a bottom lfieform as it were. I respect
it's taste for going down. Otherwise, it was found at an NBD signal of 45%,
around time pings dropped to slightly weak volume. Current distance travelled at
first spotting was very close to exact 5.00 LTC. Use this to record distance
from SLF to aquarium if feel like it.

Not a whole lot of importance is going on, but we had a chat over the
hypercaster with some of the folks at home. Morris is going to try to setting up
the Torus hypercaster to be aimed at us from 2300 tonight to 0100 tomorrow, the
idea being that the relay will allow anyone with a properly authorized
metachannel FTL communicator (current civilian pilots, government officials,
Accord officials, mostly) to talk directly to us without having to go to
Coreward Reach. So look forward to that, for when we need a break from visiting
the Aquarium station.
Sakura and Zandria are going on vacation for a couple of weeks pretty soon.
Sounded like they're going to have a good time, so that's some nice news. Morris
told us he's going to visit his family too, soon.
Damien Goss's trip to Andy's did not succeed. They lost their way. Apparently
they were hit by a storm and couldn't fix their course after. The crew
self-destructed all ships in the carrier, and then the carrier itself to prevent
the ships from potentially being recovered by enemies.

Shule Elemmire
He appears to be 26 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has
olive skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has
average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is average-shaped and
handsome, with a broad nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and tan and
occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His shoulder-length, straight hair
is blonde and neatly trimmed over the ears and parted on the side. He has large
brownish fingernails.
 He is wearing a white shipsuit with gold trim around the collar and cuffs and a
pair of light brown leather boots decorated with silver stars. He is also
wearing a keychain, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dolphins, and a backpack. His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands
are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.
enter cryo
You quickly undress and place your clothes in a storage locker.
You open a hatch on a row of cryosuspension tubes and climb in.
(60 seconds roundtime.)
You recline back in the tank. A moment later, with a hollow gurgle, you feel
viscous, ice cold liquid beginning to lap at your feet.
The liquid envelopes your feet, and they feel freezing cold for a painful moment
before going completely numb. The liquid, thick and black like crude oil, rises
slowly, turning your legs numb.
The cryo-gel rises to your abdomen and then to your chest, numbing your entire
torso. You are no longer aware of your breathing or your heartbeat. Inexorably,
the tank continues to fill.
The thick black goo laps at your chin. Instinctively, you tilt your head back,
pushing your nose and mouth into the small remaining pocket of air. Your neck
turns numb, and then the back of your head.
The liquid covers your ears and then, without any fanfare, it envelopes your
face. All you can see is blackness, and your entire body is numb. You
instinctively hold your breath.
quit
Wait 18 seconds.
Endless moments pass as adrenaline floods your body, though you cannot feel the
hammering of your heart. Suddenly, without even being aware of it, your body
gives up, your throat opening to desperately pull in air, but all it can find is
the thick black goo all around you. The gel floods your lungs, shockingly cold,
until the core of your body goes numb as well.
quit
Wait 8 seconds.
quit
You see nothing. You feel nothing. It is impossible to judge the passing of
time.
Wait 5 seconds.
