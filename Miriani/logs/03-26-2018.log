["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at "Starlight Express" Docking Bay.

You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a commodity listing here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

02:30 Katrianne Beauchene initiates a commlink with an unknown starship.

02:30 The computer announces, "Translation program active. Limited data on alien grammar and syntax may result in poor translations."
(Storage Room) You notice a ring of light illuminating a nearby maintenance drone tube. The ring rapidly draws nearer before an amorphous alien construct emerges, coming to rest directly in the center of the room.
Via the communication link, an unknown starship transmits, "Our emmisary waits in your chamber of goods storage. Provide to us data from your senses for habitat sphere of scheme "ice" for shared offerings."

02:30 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

02:30 Via the communication link, an unknown starship transmits, "Transfer for trade commodity income."

02:31 A commodity listing emerges from a nearby console.

02:31 (Storage Room) An amorphous alien construct floats through a nearby maintenance drone tube. You watch as its internal luminance casts diminishing rings of light on the tube walls as the alien construct disappears deeper into the bowels of the ship and out of sight.

02:31 The computer announces, "Undocking from an unknown starship."

02:31 You hear a satisfying click as the ship's docking ring is retracted from the docked ship's hull.

02:31 The computer announces, "Undocking complete."

02:31 You crumple a commodity listing up and throw it away.

02:31 Katrianne Beauchene says, "eh we do have data on ice but the fighter can't hold this much"

02:31 Katrianne Beauchene sets a commodity listing down on the ground.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming re

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

16:49 --------------------------------------------------
Starship Weapons
--------------------------------------------------
  Laser Turrets
Laser turrets are small turrets mounted on the hull that focus energy into an amplified beam of light in order to cause damage to a target. 
Pros:
Can fire without confirming a target.
Usually abundant on most ships.
Cons:
Begin to lose effectiveness the more they are damaged.
Require a fair amount of starship charge to fire.
Can be reflected back at you if the target has laser reflectors.
  Bardenium Cannons
Bardenium Cannons are small launchers along the starship's hull that, when activated, fire a chunk of charged bardenium at a target. The damage done by bardenium cannons is dependant on the type of bardenium being fired as well as the physical mechanism required to launch the bardenium.
Pros:
50% chance of doing hull damage.
Require less power to fire.
Aren't reduced in capacity by damage.
Cons:
Require reloading with ammunition.
Pro/Con:
Require confirming a target before they fire.
  Computer Disruption Pulse
The CDP fires a carefully modulated energy pulse at an enemy starship which will temporarily disrupt certain computers aboard the target starship. The primarily affected function is autopilot. While all ship classes are different, the majority of the time the CDP will cause sluggish response in starship autopilot and can even disable it entirely. The effects are only temporary and the initial pulse does require quite a bit of power, but it's nonetheless an effective weapon against ISC designed ships. The CDP is effective at ranges up to four units and requires six minutes to recharge, drawing power from the ship's main battery. Note that the weapon is not always effective. Under certain circumstances, it will fail to have an effect. This is always the case when using it against biological technology.
Range: 4 units

Starship Weapons
--------------------------------------------------
  Laser Turrets
Laser turrets are small turrets mounted on the hull that focus energy into an amplified beam of light in order to cause damage to a target. 
Pros:
Can fire without confirming a target.
Usually abundant on most ships.
Cons:
Begin to lose effectiveness the more they are damaged.
Require a fair amount of starship charge to fire.
Can be reflected back at you if the target has laser reflectors.
  Bardenium Cannons
Bardenium Cannons are small launchers along the starship's hull that, when activated, fire a chunk of charged bardenium at a target. The damage done by bardenium cannons is dependant on the type of bardenium being fired as well as the physical mechanism required to launch the bardenium.
Pros:
50% chance of doing hull damage.
Require less power to fire.
Aren't reduced in capacity by damage.
Cons:
Require reloading with ammunition.
Pro/Con:
Require confirming a target before they fire.
  Computer Disruption Pulse
The CDP fires a carefully modulated energy pulse at an enemy starship which will temporarily disrupt certain computers aboard the target starship. The primarily affected function is autopilot. While all ship classes are different, the majority of the time the CDP will cause sluggish response in starship autopilot and can even disable it entirely. The effects are only temporary and the initial pulse does require quite a bit of power, but it's nonetheless an effective weapon against ISC designed ships. The CDP is effective at ranges up to four units and requires six minutes to recharge, drawing power from the ship's main battery. Note that the weapon is not always effective. Under certain circumstances, it will fail to have an effect. This is always the case when using it against biological technology.
Range: 4 units
Recharge Time: 6 minutes
Effect: Slow down autopilot functions.
Usage: DISRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Disarmament Pulse
The DP is a pulse weapon that will fire a burst of energy at an enemy starship that specifically targets (conventional) weapons.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 60 seconds

23:19 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security d
23:43 rones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
