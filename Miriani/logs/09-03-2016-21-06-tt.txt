Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life
and coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a compact red refrigerator, an
engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst butterflies, a round
white rattan coffee table with a glass top, and Magellan the arachnoid security
robot here.
You can go south and out.

Greetings Johann,
I appreciate the report you sent me detailing the League's defence plan. There
are some very good points, but I also have some questions.
First of all, I like the idea of using the Torus as a staging point. It is the
most heavily armoured station and doesn't seem to be attacked often. The capital
planets as a second staging point also makes sense.
I do, however, have some questions. In the event of a large invasion, how many
ships and what class of ships do you envision as an ideal response? Also, if we
respond with more than one of the largest ships in the sector, e.g. two or more
cruisers, who has command of the fleet? 
In terms of actual combat, I think if we place too many limitations, we may
cause pilots to lose their concentration thereby risking ships and their crew.
Having fought in wasps launched from a morningstar, I know it can get cluttered.
However, if I have to consider that I can't move certain places because of the Z
axis I've been assigned, that extra  second could result in my ship
unnecessarily getting hit as well as limiting my options in terms of were I can
move. I do, however, think it is a good idea to pair big ships with small ships
and attack the same ship. For example, a gunship and a destroyer attacking the
same ship could be very useful and efficient. In fact, that destroyer could just
follow that same gunship around, attacking everything it does. Those are my
thoughts so far. I look forward to receiving your comments and thoughts as well.
Regards,
Shule

Shule. Here is the report I promised you. I hope at the very least it makes it
so that the League doesn't catch you by surprise.
First, the meeting point. IF you are able, meet at the torus, with a secondary
meeting point at Earth if the Torus is inaccessible. Crew large ships first,
then small ships if we are able. Let the larger ships take care of larger
targets, and smaller ships take care of smaller targets. I know it's possible to
beat a larger ship with a smaller, but it's more efficient this way.
The largest ship in the sector has command of the fleet and if they tell a
smaller ship to do something, the smaller ship should listen.
IF two or more ships are engaging the same target, don't go to where the enemy
has just been, or you will open yourself to friendly fire. I know it's not
always possible, but try to stay on different z-axis coordinates than your
allies, that will avoid unnecessary blockages and could cause ships to get hit.
I would like to see this done with all the alliances and have designated z-axis
points for each, but I seriously doubt I can get everyone to go along with that.
If the enemy is an ifs fleet, please refer to the posts about ifs priority on
this board. If you are fighting ifs, it is best to have two or more larger ships
to take turns taking the lrl damage.
I would love to have invasion drills, but my previous attempts to implement them
have been unsuccessful, however, the better prepared we are, the harder it will
be for us to be subjugated again.

Hello Johann and Sean,

then. in order to plan for enough time, I should leave no later
than Monday, August 29th. and preferably over this coming weekend.
Having said this, I want to invite a few to come along and we can
share the eggs. I have all of the varieties of fish but I do want
to claim one of the dark gray snapper eggs. The rest would be up
to the crew to share. I might get another Seastar if I see a color
I don't have though.
If either or both of you would like to come along with Shule and I
and perhaps a couple of others, please let me know what day/time
from after 2359 on Friday, August 26th on until Monday latest.
We'll be flying my Exploration Platform, William Dove. There are
crew quarters available for 4 additional persons besides Shule and
myself or 4 couples as it can accomodate ten crew. However I'm
not particularly interested in taking along 8 more crew. If you
have someone in mind you would like to invite, if they're not going
to room with you, bear in mind that we may have to get organized as
to who rooms where if they are not a part of a couple.
As for Shule and I, we're generally able to fly from about noon GST
until around 0500 the next day but sometimes as late as 1400 on.
We'd like to keep flying so if either you or Sean are typically
awake from around 0500 until 1300, that would be very helpful but
not required. I generally just reduce trim while sleeping so we're
still moving.
Let me know and if you have any thoughts, concerns or whatever.
Best regards,
Lily Kaise

Hello Johann and Sean,
First please don't share the information below with others as this

l wall
a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst
aquatic life and coral rocks
An utterly massive aquarium designed to decorate an entire wall.
It is filled with water.
It is closed.
Inside it you see a plastic frond of light green sea fern, a white plastic
undersea castle, a small plastic statue of a Jinu, a plastic flower with red
petals, a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender, a string of light purple plastic kelp,
a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag, and a small plastic statue of a shark.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a short
yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a long gold
soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a long orange soft-bodied
creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a short amethyst soft-bodied creature
with many claw-tipped tentacles, a medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a
yellow shell and four small claws, a firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth
yellow tendrils, a medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and
four small claws, a firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils, a
large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
red glowing interior, a large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with
medium-length dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior, a medium-sized
semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing
interior, a large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length
dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior, a medium-sized
semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a chartreuse
glowing interior, a large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling
tendrils and an amber glowing interior, a large semi-transparent cylindrical
creature with very long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior, and a
large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils
and an amethyst glowing interior are living in it.
That's seventeen creatures, and the tank could probably safely hold thirteen
more.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set
of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes
are green and wide. Her mid-back length, slightly curly hair is dark blonde and
parted on the side and smoothed back behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed
clear fingernails. She has a large black satin bow in her hair. She has a tiny
birthmark on her neck.
 She is wearing a red velvet jacket with modest lapels trimmed with gold braid,
an expensive silver watch with diamond accents, a pair of silky light blue
pants, and a pair of black leather boots decorated with neon green stars. She is
also wearing a light purple cotton drawstring purse, a metallic green touch
einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a delicate ring of silver wire and
small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace, a wrist-mounted
chronometer, and a standard starship flightbag. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light purple shipsuit with purple trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life

noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted

The following pages contain various notes about headings and ndb signals. The
goal was to find our way home, so I ttracked my course to figure out where we
were.
Note 1
NDB signals were at 79 for the standard, 94 for the extra long range, from now
on to be refered to as 79 94 to keep it short.
no beacons were in range, so we changed to heading 45 33. we traveled at this
heading for 13.07 lgc when I still noticed no change.
I then changed heading to 0 0 to see what would happen.
After having traveled 3.63 lgc on this course, the ndb's dropped to 78 94, so i
decided to backtrack at a course of 180 0.

I am now convinced we traveled too far south. the east and west headings I am
not entirely certain of, and it's worth noting that the flow is coming from the
east and very slightly down, so we probably have some drift westward.

Star Conquest has a fully-realized space system as one of its primary features.
Space is big and it can be confusing. Sometimes intentionally! But here are the
basics.
SECTORS
Space is divided into sectors, which are simply a way of marking off and
differentiating volumes of space.
Sectors are three-dimensional, and are further subdivided into coordinates: 20
by 20 by 20.
Numbers! Each sector is 240,000km across on each axis, or about 1/625th of an
astronomical unit, or about 8/10ths of a light-second. So, a lightyear is just
shy of 40 million sectors. This would be common knowledge among pilots.
BEACONS
A sector exists because a beacon has been placed there broadcasting its
location. This beacon is what allows starships to jump there using their
wormhole drive.
Beacons can be based on planets, on space stations, or free-floating in a beacon
housing.
There are three types of beacons you'll commonly encounter:
* Primary beacons: These are beacons for main sectors that you can jump to from
any location (with a few exceptions). Examples are Earthgate, Providence Gate,
or the Dusty Reaches. These are primary thoroughfares and also act as travel
bottlenecks.
* Secondary beacons: These are used within a sector cluster. For instance, Old
Earth Orbit and Martian Orbit are both marked by secondary beacons. What this
means is that from another sector cluster, you would first have to jump to
Earthgate, because that is the primary beacon for the cluster. From there, you
can jump to Old Earth or Mars, the secondary beacons.
* Weak beacons: These are not really a separate category, because primary or
secondary beacons can also be weak. Weak beacons do not broadcast over a wide
range, and generally a ship's computer must know of its approximate location
before it can scan for a weak beacon. Scanning will still usually take several
attempts. Weak beacons are used in Mutuality space to help it remain hidden.
SECURITY
Sectors also each have a security rating describing the degree of safety you can
expect there. Check the SECURITY RATINGS help file for more information.
MOVING BETWEEN SECTORS
You can travel to other sectors with your starship's JUMP command. You can type
this command by itself for a list of accessible sectors, or you can type JUMP
[sector name] to start traveling there immediately. For instance, JUMP EARTHGATE
will take you straight to the Earthgate sector from most locations.
Your starship can also successfully navigate multiple jumps. For instance, if
you're in a distant sector cluster and you type JUMP OLD EARTH, your ship will
automatically travel first to Earthgate and then make a second jump to Old Earth
Orbit. Linked jumps such as these will occur faster and use less battery charge
than if you performed the jumps individually.

Star Conquest Help: Making Starcharts
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Starcharts are, generally speaking, complex navigation aids that are useful for
many, many years. They are made with careful exploration, long-term
observations, and in the case of distant unreg groups, sometimes even loss of
life. Such charts are extremely precious to those that produce them.
However, modern technology provides new options for those who are able to
understand starchart notation. Using high-quality space-based observatories and
complex cartography mainframes, much of the observation process can be
automated, and the calculations then finalized into a modestly-sized temporary
starchart. These typically do not hold a candle to the real thing, but are
useful enough for the average expedition.
REQUIREMENTS
A few things are required in order to make a starchart:
* Someone who understands starchart notation
* Three observatory space station modules
* At least two hyperwave-capable temporary space stations
* One cartography mainframe space station module
* Time
You are likely used to the idea that, to find an exact unknown point, you need
two known points of observation. These three points form a triangle and all
necessary information can then be derived, a process known as triangulation.
However, this assumes a two-dimensional plane. In three dimensional space, three
points of observation are required.
This is why you need three different observatory modules on three different
temporary space stations. The more they are spread apart, the larger the chart
they can produce. However, one of the observatories can be placed on the same
station as the cartography mainframe, so that you still need only three stations
in total.
THE PROCESS
This, then, is the simplest way to produce a starchart:
1) Deploy a temporary space station with an observatory module and a cartography
mainframe.
2) Travel some distance away. The greater the distance, the larger the final
chart.
3) Deploy another temporary space station, this time with an observatory module
and the ability to hypercast.
4) Transmit a carrier signal to the station containing the mainframe. Signal
strength matters, so consider this when deciding at what distance the stations
should be.
5) Travel some distance away again. Equidistance from both previous stations is
ideal.
6) Deploy another hypercasting temporary space station with an observatory
module.
7) Transmit a carrier signal from this third station to the station containing
the mainframe.
8) Return to the mainframe station and ensure it is getting a strong signal from
both remote observatories.
9) Use the CHART command to begin a calculation.
10) Wait. The longer the stations are allowed to observe, the longer the final
chart will last. The stations do not need to be manned during this time.
11) Return to the mainframe station and end the ongoing calculation.
12) Have a starchart user finalize the calculation. The more proficient the
user, the better the final result.
A FEW TIPS
* Ideally, for a starchart that potentially lasts weeks, the stations should be
able to observe for several days.
* Balance the distance of your stations against your ability to aim a strong
carrier signal at the mainframe.
* An ideal distance is not necessarily a huge one. A good observatory greatly
multiplies the effective observed radius.
* Tailor to your needs. Just need a chart to find home again? That's cheap and
easy. Want to chart a large area for months? That requires the very best
equipment and an expert starchart user.
* The starchart user's proficiency is the largest limiting factor. Good
equipment helps an expert reach their full potential, but it is wasted on an
amateur.

   Many people are Bad at Rift Drives, but many people seem to genuinely
think that they are actually good at rift drive operation. Even you, the
reader, may be Bad at Rift Drives, but there is a cure. With proper
education such as this text, anyone can potentially become Good at Rift
Drives. The first step is the willingness to accept your faults, and the
second step is the willingness to learn. Assumedly, you have both. Come
along with me on this educational voyage into rift drive theory.

   Many people are wondering: What is this rift and why do I care? Well,
you may be wondering that if you have not actually ever used a rift
drive. If you have used rift drive then you know why you care. Maybe.
You might not. Regardless, we are straying off topic. The rift is a tear
in unified spacetime discovered by Peter of None (The EAOS Peter of
None, not the Bari spreading Peter of None) where the conventional laws
of physics do not, in the strictest sense, apply. It is sort of like
being half awake, yet half dreaming. Real, and yet at the same time...
very unreal. Even so, in such a strange place, there are lifeforms that
eke out their existence here.
   After almost one trade cycle trapped inside, Peter was extracted by a
team of pilots and by using what he learned he developed the Rift Drive:
First Edition. It may not be as good as the developed some time ago 
Second Edition, and certainly not as good as the new and improved Third 
Edition, but the technology is more than sufficient enough for use.
   The Rift Drive contains a way to get in and out of the rift safely,
though it is not a form of locomotion all of its own. A rift drive
equipped ship has a 'sail' that can be extended. The chaotic flow of the
rift can move your ship at extreme speeds, or you can crawl along if the
flow is poor. Ultimately, you are placing your ship into the grasp of
'nature' and hoping for the best result you can get.
   Of course, that is a fatalistic observation.

========================================================================

   As stated previously, when you are navigating in the riftflow, you
are at the whim of the flow to determine your speed. If you just want to
go as fast as your sail will allow, travel in the exact opposite
direction of the flow. Generally, however, you will have a destination
in mind, so this only comes in handy occasionally.
   To navigate in the rift you must provide the heading and
inclination/declination values. The heading is an X-Y heading from 0 to
359.99 (repeating) degrees. 0 degrees is east, 90 is north, 180 is west,
and 270 is south. Of course, you can always provide a NEGATIVE heading
if you really desire. That way, -90 is south, -180 is still west, and
-270 is north. This might help you a little if you, for whatever reason,
forget what heading south is but remember where north is! Northeast,
northwest, and so on are hallway between the two directions. Northeast
is at 45 degrees, and the rest are left as an exercise to the reader.
   Inclination is slightly different. It ranges from 90 to -90, either
extreme representing directly up or directly down. If your inclination
is at either maximum, your X-Y heading is actually meaningless, as you
are not travelling along the X-Y plane at all!
   In a way, if it helps you to organize your thoughts: Every degree
east (or west) that you are going is a degree that you are not going
north (or south). The same applies for up and down. If you are heading
at an inclination of 55 degrees, (almost) exactly half of your movement
is applied on the Z axis. If you were going at a heading of (45, 55),
then half of your movement would be dedicated towards going up, one
quarter would be dedicated to going north, and one quarter would be
dedicated to going east. You could put this into vector notation as
<0.25, 0.25, 0.5>.

   Fallacy One: "If somebody travelled south for ten light-trade cycles
and then turned southeast and travelled for two light-trade cycles, I
can get there faster by turning southeast at the same starting point!"
   This actually has an element of truth to it, but since it is
extremely difficult to know the exact heading to something, it largely
only serves to get you massively lost over the long term. Let us
consider the mathematics.
   Starship A has travelled along the heading (270, 0) for ten
light-trade cycles, and the heading (315, 0) for two light-trade cycles.
You can break this down into vectors easily.
   In a simplified vector format, this would be a vector of <0, -10, 0>
and <1.41, -1.41, 0>. Why 1.41? Well, think of it as the hypotenuse of a
triangle and that you are breaking it down to its legs. Combined, the
vector would be <1.41, -11.41, 0>. This gives us an exact heading from
the starting point of (277, 0) degrees at a length of about 11.5
light-trade cycles. As you can see, small changes in heading add up
hugely over time.
   Now, if Starship B travelled along the heading (315, 0) for ten
light-trade cycles, they would have a vector of <7.07, -7.07, 0>.
Looking purely at the numbers, you can tell that Starship B is far off
course, and just to get to the same location they would need to travel a
vector of <-5.66, -4.34, 0>, or for 7.13 light-trade cycles at a heading
of (217, 0). Overall, because of this fallacy, they have had to travel
17.13 light-trade cycles just to get to the point that Starship A
travelled in 12! Again, small changes in heading add up to large changes
in position over time.
   Fallacy Two: "If I have travelled north for two light-trade cycles
and east for two light-trade cycles, I have travelled northeast for two
light-trade cycles!"
   Not quite. Consider the unit circle, or even just a triangle. There
is a theorem that is taught to all children when they are young about
this exact thing.
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This is to find the direct diagonal line between two
orthagonal points, or you could consider them to be the legs of a right
triangle. It is applicable with non-orthogonal headings as well, but you
need to break the heading down into a vector first. Using this example,
2^2 is 4, so 2^2 + 2^2 is 8. The square root of 8 is about 2.82. So, you
have not travelled northeast for two light-trade cycles, but rather for
2.82 light-trade cycles. That is almost .82 free light-trade cycles!
Admittedly, you traveled 4 light-trade cycles, so in reality you
travelled for 1.18 light-trade cycles longer than you would have had you
travelled directly northeast from the start.
   Fallacy Three: "The rift locator gives me an exact heading as soon as
I see something!"
   Again, this is incorrect. It gives you a vague heading. Something
that is 'North' could be an exact 90 degrees! Or... it could be at a
heading of 80 degrees. Or 100! It is extremely difficult to know the
exact heading to a location, and in practice, you will never know it.
The mathematical examples used previous are the same math that you would
use, but you would never know the numbers to such exacting amounts. You
can certainly know the distance, but the heading is much more difficult
to ascertain.

========================================================================

   As stated previously, when you are navigating in the riftflow, you
are at the whim of the flow to determine your speed. If you just want to
go as fast as your sail will allow, travel in the exact opposite
direction of the flow. Generally, however, you will have a destination
in mind, so this only comes in handy occasionally.
   To navigate in the rift you must provide the heading and
inclination/declination values. The heading is an X-Y heading from 0 to
359.99 (repeating) degrees. 0 degrees is east, 90 is north, 180 is west,
and 270 is south. Of course, you can always provide a NEGATIVE heading
if you really desire. That way, -90 is south, -180 is still west, and
-270 is north. This might help you a little if you, for whatever reason,
forget what heading south is but remember where north is! Northeast,
northwest, and so on are hallway between the two directions. Northeast
is at 45 degrees, and the rest are left as an exercise to the reader.
   Inclination is slightly different. It ranges from 90 to -90, either
extreme representing directly up or directly down. If your inclination
is at either maximum, your X-Y heading is actually meaningless, as you
are not travelling along the X-Y plane at all!
   In a way, if it helps you to organize your thoughts: Every degree
east (or west) that you are going is a degree that you are not going
north (or south). The same applies for up and down. If you are heading
at an inclination of 55 degrees, (almost) exactly half of your movement
is applied on the Z axis. If you were going at a heading of (45, 55),
then half of your movement would be dedicated towards going up, one
quarter would be dedicated to going north, and one quarter would be
dedicated to going east. You could put this into vector notation as
<0.25, 0.25, 0.5>.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life
and coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde
noisemaker, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, an engraved silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst
butterflies, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, Magellan the
arachnoid security robot, a red nylon mesh shopping bag, and an insulated green
cooler here.

But there's no reason to do so. Also, it definitely wouldn't help with database
bloat. People will understand when they can't find the object you're talking
about in your emotes.

rift heading 180 -55
You quickly turn a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
You venture through a side door.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0,
-55.0.
You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

   Fallacy One: "If somebody travelled south for ten light-trade cycles
and then turned southeast and travelled for two light-trade cycles, I
can get there faster by turning southeast at the same starting point!"
   This actually has an element of truth to it, but since it is
extremely difficult to know the exact heading to something, it largely
only serves to get you massively lost over the long term. Let us
consider the mathematics.
   Starship A has travelled along the heading (270, 0) for ten
light-trade cycles, and the heading (315, 0) for two light-trade cycles.
You can break this down into vectors easily.
   In a simplified vector format, this would be a vector of <0, -10, 0>
and <1.41, -1.41, 0>. Why 1.41? Well, think of it as the hypotenuse of a
triangle and that you are breaking it down to its legs. Combined, the
vector would be <1.41, -11.41, 0>. This gives us an exact heading from
the starting point of (277, 0) degrees at a length of about 11.5
light-trade cycles. As you can see, small changes in heading add up
hugely over time.
   Now, if Starship B travelled along the heading (315, 0) for ten
light-trade cycles, they would have a vector of <7.07, -7.07, 0>.
Looking purely at the numbers, you can tell that Starship B is far off
course, and just to get to the same location they would need to travel a
vector of <-5.66, -4.34, 0>, or for 7.13 light-trade cycles at a heading
of (217, 0). Overall, because of this fallacy, they have had to travel
17.13 light-trade cycles just to get to the point that Starship A
travelled in 12! Again, small changes in heading add up to large changes
in position over time.
   Fallacy Two: "If I have travelled north for two light-trade cycles
and east for two light-trade cycles, I have travelled northeast for two
light-trade cycles!"
   Not quite. Consider the unit circle, or even just a triangle. There
is a theorem that is taught to all children when they are young about
this exact thing.
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This is to find the direct diagonal line between two
orthagonal points, or you could consider them to be the legs of a right
triangle. It is applicable with non-orthogonal headings as well, but you
need to break the heading down into a vector first. Using this example,
2^2 is 4, so 2^2 + 2^2 is 8. The square root of 8 is about 2.82. So, you
have not travelled northeast for two light-trade cycles, but rather for
2.82 light-trade cycles. That is almost .82 free light-trade cycles!
Admittedly, you traveled 4 light-trade cycles, so in reality you
travelled for 1.18 light-trade cycles longer than you would have had you
travelled directly northeast from the start.
   Fallacy Three: "The rift locator gives me an exact heading as soon as
I see something!"
   Again, this is incorrect. It gives you a vague heading. Something
that is 'North' could be an exact 90 degrees! Or... it could be at a
heading of 80 degrees. Or 100! It is extremely difficult to know the
exact heading to a location, and in practice, you will never know it.
The mathematical examples used previous are the same math that you would
use, but you would never know the numbers to such exacting amounts. You
can certainly know the distance, but the heading is much more difficult
to ascertain.

   Often, you will find the flow is against you in the heading that you
wish to travel. To get to your destination location faster, you may wish
to engage in a practice known as 'tacking.'
   To do this, you travel in the general direction of your target, but
perhaps orthogonal to it. After a certain distance, you change your
heading to point in the other direction, as if you are cancelling out
the initial deviation from your target heading. You will travel a longer
distance overall, but you may actually get to your location faster.
However, with all of these heading changes, an inexperience navigater
may find herself getting lost in the rift much more easily, so it is
good to keep notes somewhere. If you have the heading and distance
travelled for every heading change, you can figure out your exact
heading and distance from your start point. Ultimately, it is up to the
pilot if they wish to tack or not, but if the flow is directly against
you, you may not have much of a choice in the matter.

rift heading
Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a
planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The
wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an
eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer reports the presence of an artifact.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Artifact (nearest).
Lily Kaise activates the ultimate salvage sensor and begins scanning for chunks
of debris.
The salvage sensor reports detection of a small shipwreck (grade 20) at a range
of 84000km at Sector South and Up, a small shipwreck (grade 20) at a range of
144000km at Sector Southwest and Up, a medium-sized shipwreck (grade 20) at a
range of 84000km at Sector Northwest and Up, and a small shipwreck (grade 10) at
a range of 168000km at Sector Southwest and Up.

A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck
flying a pirate flag.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
Lily Kaise deftly enters a set of coordinates, and the computer chirps in
