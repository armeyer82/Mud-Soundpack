-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a discount beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.

#help action
Command: #action {search string} {commands} {priority}

         Have tintin search for a certain string of text from the mud, if the
         string is found it will execute the commands.  Variables %1 to %99
         are substituted from the input string, and can be used in the command.

         If the search string starts with ~, color codes must be matched, which
         you can see by enabling: #config {convert meta} on.

         The following Perl compatible regular expression options are available:

       ^ force match of start of line.
       $ force match of end of line.
  %1-%99 lazy match of any text, available at %1-%99.
      %0 should be avoided in triggers, and if left alone lists all matches.
     { } embed a raw regular expression, available at %1-%99 + 1.
         [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within
         braces. Keep in mind that { } is replaced with ( ) automatically.

         Of the following the (lazy) match is available at %1-%99 + 1

      %w match zero to any number of letters.
      %W match zero to any number of non letters.
      %d match zero to any number of digits.
      %D match zero to any number of non digits.
      %s match zero to any number of spaces.
      %S match zero to any number of non spaces.

      %? match zero or one character.
      %. match one character.
      %+ match one to any number of characters.
      %* match zero to any number of characters.

      %i matching becomes case insensitive.
      %I matching becomes case sensitive (default).

         Actions can be triggered by the showme command.

Example: #act {^You are hungry$} {get bread backpack;eat bread}
         Performs 2 commands as you get the hunger message, tintin will not
         be fooled by someone saying 'You are hungry'.

Example: #act {%1 tells you 'hello'} {tell %1 Hello %1. How are you today?}
         This allows you to seem like a nice, attentive, fast typing gentleman.

Example: #act {A puppy barks at you, wagging {his|her|its} tail.} {pat puppy}
         This allows you to be nice to puppies regardless of their sex.

Comment: You can remove an action with the #unaction command.
#show {his|her|its}
his|her|its
#show {his|her|its}
his|her|its
#help reg
Command: #regexp {string} {expression} {true} {false}

         Compares the string to the given regular expression.

         Variables are stored in &1 to &99 with &0 holding the matched
substring.

       ^ force match of start of string.
       $ force match of end of string.
  %1-%99 lazy match of any text, available at &1-&99.
      %0 should be avoided in triggers, and if left alone &0 lists all matches.
     { } embed a raw regular expression, available at last &1-&99 + 1.
         [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within
         braces. Keep in mind that { } is replaced with ( ) automatically.

         Of the following the lazy match is available at last &1-&99 + 1.

      %w match zero to any number of letters.
      %W match zero to any number of non letters.
      %d match zero to any number of digits.
      %D match zero to any number of non digits.
      %s match zero to any number of spaces.
      %S match zero to any number of non spaces.

      %? match zero or one character.
      %. match one character.
      %+ match one to any number of characters.
      %* match zero to any number of characters.

      %i matching becomes case insensitive.
      %I matching becomes case sensitive (default).

Example: #regexp {bli bla blo} {bli {.*} blo} {#showme &1}

Simon Collins (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour)
This is a slim but fairly tough-looking battlesuit, painted white all over,
except where the paint has worn off. It resembles some sort of large humanoid
robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs
extend into a framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A
repeating weapon attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A microdrone
applicator is attached to the left wrist, a hose leading to a large tank on the
left bicep.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.

Lily,
Please, I said I was sorry. I waited to see if Kim would volunteer and when she
did, I figured we wouldnât be able to get the crew together to clear Old
Frontier as weâd have to find someone else to replace her or wait anyways. If
it makes you feel better, then fine, call me selfish. Maybe I am, but Iâve
looked the other way plenty of times when Iâve been left out of beacons or
activities because I had to doze for a few minutes. I didn't know it was going
to be such a big deal. You probably have seen me go on beacons even though I've
done all of mine just to let someone else complete theirs and of course, I would
do the same for you. If a slot had opened up on this beacon, I would have
suggested you immediately. Unfortunately, no slots opened up. If other beacons
are called for while I'm asleep, then go for it.
Guess I'm not as perfect as you so claimed I was last night. I do hope you find
that perfect someone someday, but apparently it's not me.
With a sad and broken heart,

Shule, I don't understand why you couldn't wait just 15-20 minutes for me. I've
been sitting around since yesterday while you did your work as I want to support
your advancement. So I at least was up front with you and Kim stating that I had
to nap briefly but you sure couldn't wait 15-20 minutes for me. I waited for
hours sitting here and you ran off to do the nest. That's the problem with our
alliance as our pilots are so self-centered that they can't wait for another and
we don't come together to do things for the good of the alliance and oh yes our
own pilots as an alliance. I'm very disappointed. as I've been waiting nearly an
hour and I have done so much to support and to help you yet you are too selfish
to wait 15 or 20 minutes for me so we could work together?

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead

You peer into stairway to the pilot lounge...
[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a
brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Liam O'Toole is standing here. Melinda Michaels and Cilah Silverthorn are
sitting on a cushy booth seat. Joel Kringle and Lily Kaise are sitting on a
comfortable wooden chair.

One of the integeral folks for organizing this one won't be available until the
second week of July, so tentative date is the eighth at 23:59.
I've received just enough interest to fill the starship up, and will be sending
out confirmation letters shortly.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.
You can go out.

asking Lillian, the story goes that Lillian was asked because if she went,
Melinda would go too. For that reason, Melinda and Lillian nearly did not join

Shule, yeah I told you I wouldn't be long which if you'd have thought it
important enough, you would have waited as you know that if we do our beacons as
an alliance that they obviously count for the alliance. But nooo you were too
impatient to wait perhaps a half hour and I wasn't even dozing that long. I sat
around all that time too patiently and thinking I was being nice to support you.
I guess too I'm just your squeeze whenever Shule Elemmire wants her. Honest if
wither of you would have said the same, unless I was on a very tight schedule,
I'd have accomodated you. Alas, it's obvious that I expect too much.

Lily,
From your last couple of letters, it is apparent to me that we both need to cool
off some before we say things we regret. Maybe I didn't write my first letter
clearly enough or perhaps emotions got in the way of interpreting it correctly.
In either case, I'm sorry for not waiting for you. I know what it's like to plan
an activity and have people ditch it for another one. It's true that I could
have been more accommodating. If there is a next time, I will take that into
consideration. However, whatever you decide, I will always care about you. 
Sincerely,

I hadn't decided on anything but to go take a very brief timeout. As per usual,
you chose to stomp out. I only left briefly and came back to find you had moved
out. It tells me loud and clear that you're expecting me not to raise any
complaint and to suck up what you want me to. Yeah it's a lot to swallow and if
I give in, you'll tell Emily, Melinda and the whole universe everything as you
always do. I asked you to keep our differences between us but what do you do?
All I hope is that you did raise my concern about how we as AEU aren't trying
hard enough to pull together and if it means waiting a half an hour for someone
who has already bothered to tell you that she would be available after a brief
nap, then I suppose that isn't good enough. Yeah I do have to admit it too that
you are so eager to stomp out and totally move out at the first opportunity. If
you were truly committed to um what I thought we have, you would not do that. So
Ok shule if you want to be on your own, then be happy. Otherwise, I expect you
to come back this morning and if you don't, then i'll invalidate your key as I
will consider that you aren't interested in me. As for Kim's expedition, it's
rather questionable if I should go and just decline now so someone else can have
my spot. You have been rather vague about her expedition and being an org
member, you obviously know what she was planning but you seemed to not want to
share which was obvious the first time when she mentioned it to me and I had no
clue. It makes me really wonder that you wanted an excuse to sever ties with me
all along. So if you don't bother to do anything this morning, that tells all. I
guess I should consider it done though since you didn't waste any time with
moving out.

All I said to Kim was what you had already expressed over the AEU channel and
that was that you weren't happy with me. Other than that, I defended you and
told her that you had planned your expedition for a while. But why am I even
saying this? Besides, name one of my ex's that I have spoken ill of or shared
relationship information with people? They shared information way before I ever
did. So why would I suddenly go to Emily, Melinda and whoever else and speak
negatively of you? I never did with my ex's. Why whould I change that now?

I have never been one for good-byes and I'd rather move out before people tell

You want us as an Alliance to work together and I appreciate that. So how does
arguing over the alliance channel help with that? Also, I told you before that I
sometimes need time by myself to cool off and gather my thoughts. You promised
me that youâd try to be understanding about that. Giving me ultimatums
doesnât seem very understanding. Maybe Iâm weird that way. Do you want me to
come back yelling and hurling insults at you? Is that really what you want or
would you rather have me be calm so we can try to talk things out. I promise you
right now that if I come back this moment, I will likely not be very civil

Shule, you know me better than that. I'm the one who always asks you not to
stomp out like that. I should think that your moving out would be a mutual
decision and only after we had made an effort to resolve our differences. You
have gone to Melinda before about us and it seems Emily was aware of things
before too. Melinda knew more than I was comfortable with knowing too as I truly
felt that we should as adults, resolve our difference between just us all along.
I only responded to her while on the trip that time because she questioned me or
I wouldn't have even brought it up. So why is it that you want an out so much? I
believe I should know. As for Kim, she started in asking me if I had a problem
with her which implies you had said more to her. I guess i'll keep it in mind
that you just wanted an excuse to move out after all. Shule if anything matters,
then one works on it. If you want an out then you do what you did earlier. I
won't beg you but I still stand that if you do not bother to show up this
morning, then I will invalidate your key as I will be convinced that you truly
wanted an excuse to leave.

Lily,

Before Kim said something about there being a problem between you two, I hadn't
said anything. I have no idea why she said that or how she got that impression.
Way to jump to conclusions before you ask questions. I thought you were way
smarter than that. You know what? I have no idea what Emily knew because again,
you assumed I'd talked ot her about us. I had not. If things matter, than people
take the time to gather all the facts before jumping to conclusions that are
unfounded. Maybe that's why I made a shitty voice too. I wanted to gather all
the facts and not make rash decisions based on two or three people's emotional
opinions. 
*
If I followed that line of thinking, I'd have lost my cruiser that day when I
broke all of its failsafes. But whatever, I'm done arguing. Invalidate my key if
you want based on anger and misunderstanding and rash conclusions. Up to you.

What insults did I ever voice to you over the alliance channel? You truly are
dilusional Shule. I only responded to Kim when she asked me if I had a problem
with her. Otherwise the only thing I said was on General that some people can't
wait 15 to 20 minutes and that I was alone. How could that be an insult. Oh too,
I did say that I felt that we don't make a better effort to work together as an
alliance and I still feel that way. I did use the word fuck when I reiterated
the same thing to you. you so many times have had your own times when you needed
to nap and i've had to wait far longer but I accomodated you and did it because
I respected you and cared enough to want to have your participation. I felt as
though you both discounted what I had offered and I even told you personally
that I would not be long. If it were me, yes I would have waited but I guess I
know now that was too much for me to ask and I'm so bad for that. So why are you
mad at me? you're not the one who has gotten no work to do for over 24 hours?
Thank the stars I bothered to mine over on Glittering. Seriously I'm obviously
the selfish one here right? I shouldn't care about our alliance goals and I
shouldn't care about whether or not the one I love takes me seriously or not.
Sometimes we do need to clear the air but there again, you're just wanting an
out. I'll allow you to come in this morning and if you don't, I know you are
just not interested.

"Well then rather than being angry and defensive," asks Lily, "if you'd said you
didn't, that would be easier to take don't you think?"
'I don't appreciate being accused before I even have a chance to defend myself.
"I don't appreciate being accused before I even have a chance to defend myself,"
you say.
"If you implied I said something that I know I truly didn't, I'd simply state
that and stick to my word," Lily says. "That shows a lot more sincerety."
'And if people would take time to ask questions and find answers before people
are accused, then that'd help too.
You say, "And if people would take time to ask questions and find answers before
people are accused, then that'd help too."
"Uh huh right," says Lily.
"What questions was I supposed to ask?" Lily asks.
'Hmm, I don't know. Maybe ask Kim how she got the impression that you had a
problem with her?
"Hmm, I don't know," you say. "Maybe ask Kim how she got the impression that you
had a problem with her?"
"Kim blurted it out," says Lily. "She had to make her assumption from some
information right?"
'Yeah, so ask her how she came to that conclusion, then if she says me, come
blame me.
"Yeah," you say, "so ask her how she came to that conclusion, then if she says
me, come blame me."
"I certainly hadn't expressed anything but to you," Lily says.
'Then you'd have every right to.
You say, "Then you'd have every right to."
'Until then, who the hell knows since I didn't say anything.
"Until then," you say, "who the hell knows since I didn't say anything."
"So it just seemed evident that you had said something to her," Lily says. "If
you didn't, then why be defensive about it. If you did then that seems a reason
for defending yourself."
'No, it isn't. Like I said, I don't like being accused of something I never did.
"No, it isn't," you say. "Like I said, I don't like being accused of something I
never did."
Lily says, "I guess I didn't have much time to as I got the impression you and
she had had your talk over the org or such."
'Yeah, the only thing she said over the org channel was that I had been the only
one to contact her about going on the expedition.
"Yeah," you say, "the only thing she said over the org channel was that I had
been the only one to contact her about going on the expedition."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
"So honestly even though I didn't pose it as a question, why lash out at me?"
Lily asks. "I'm the one who you guys overlooked you know. I told you I wuld only
be for a short time. If I knew I was going to be more than less than a half
hour, I would have been forth-coming as I wouldn't expect you to wait."
Lily says, "So ok in order to get along in the future I absolutely am not
allowed to express any dissatisfaciton I've been told."
'I'm not lashing out at you for that. I understand that you felt disappointed. I
didn't know what time frame you anticipated. Now that I know that, I'll be more
considerate in the future.
"I'm not lashing out at you for that," you say. "I understand that you felt
disappointed. I didn't know what time frame you anticipated. Now that I know
that, I'll be more considerate in the future."
Lily says, "I told you shule."
Lily says, "I told ou i'd be only dozey for a short time."
'And how am I supposed to know what a short time means to you?
"And," you ask, "how am I supposed to know what a short time means to you?"
Lily says, "You could even have verified with me oh is that an hour or moe if it
was truly important."
'To some, short is 5 minutes. To some a half an hour is short. It's all
relative.
"To some, short is 5 minutes," you say. "To some a half an hour is short. It's
all relative."
"I also wouldn't have brought it up that I wanted to do something with both of
you had I felt I needed to be dozey for a prolonged period," Lily says. "Again,
you should know me better than that."
Lily says, "I would have not even mentioned it."
'Well, I told my crew once I'd be dozey for 10 minutes and they all ditched out.
"Well," you say, "I told my crew once I'd be dozey for 10 minutes and they all
ditched out."
'So, I guess for them short was 10 minutes.
"So," you say, "I guess for them short was 10 minutes."
'and 10 minutes was too long.
You say, "And 10 minutes was too long."
"Well that was them but that's not you and me and if you don't know me and can
trust what I say," says Lily, "then yeah we have a problem."
'I just didn't know what short meant.
You say, "I just didn't know what short meant."
Lily glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.
Lily rolls her eyes.
Lily says, "Ok."
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
"So I'm that inconsiderate that I'd ask you both if you wanted to do something,"
asks Lily, "that I'd expect you to wait indefinitely?"
Lily asks, "Do I have a pattern of that?"
frown "Damn it. I never said you did!"
"Damn it. I never said you did!'" You frown.
Lily says, "My name isn't Jonathan Gray."
Lily says, "We've been living together for a few months now and if you don't
know me well enough and that my word is what it is, then that's sad."
'You're obviously not listening to me.
"You're obviously not listening to me," you say.
Lily says, "Well you're obviously not listening to meeither or it seems you just
are in denial of what was."
Lily sighs.
"I'll let it go as you mean too much to me but it still hurts a lot," Lily says.
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around

Lily says, "Well I know but moving out in five minutes makes me feel that our
relationship is expendable to you."
"As I said, it should be a mutual decision and I hadn't decided that at all,"
Lily says. "You aren't violent and disagreements are what they are but it's no
reason to move out."

business shooting."

Lily exclaims, "Don't worry Hun this is not a quiz!"

"Yeah, maybe they are, but what did Luja say about me?" you ask. "And yeah, I

Lily asks, "Well remember when I said to her that you were my Favorite man in
the universe?"
nod 'But I don't remember what she said.
You nod. "But I don't remember what she said."
"I can't remember it verbatim but she sort of said that it wouldn't be
surprising if we weren't or such it just came across as a bit sarcastic," Lily
says. "Anyone else would likely not have said anything."
Lily laughs.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Exploration.

You laugh. "Oh yeah."

"Well," says Lily, "you obviously know I was on a certain level."
Lily smiles.

You smile.
"Poor kim," says Lily. "She has a couple of decisions to make."
Lily says, "I would have qualified it like this."
'Yeah, she does.
"Yeah, she does," you say.
"That in order to go," says Lily, "one should at least have 200 industry to
qualify for a navaid and a jet."
"Because all crew should be able-bodied enough to take care of all duties with
the exception of navigation perhaps which they would learn by participation,"
Lily says.
'Yeah, that'd be good.
You say, "Yeah, that'd be good."
"When that rift drive breaks down and you might be the only pilot awake, then
you need to be able to independently go out and repair the rift drive," Lily
says. "I've done it. You've done it and it might occur that they would need to
as well."

You nod.
"I was a very new pilot when I went with Pierre to Andy's and Tom Town," Lily
says. "He made me a set of repair tools as at taht time I barely had anything on
my workbench. So as luck would have it, Pierre is sound asleep and the drive
broke down and I had to repair it by myself."
Lily says, "I guessed my way through it literally."
"I had no idea," says Lily.
'wow
"Wow," you say.
"I fumbled with those things until I figured them out," Lily says.
"I was pretty scared," says Lily.
'I kind of did the same thing on Matt's ship, but someone had at least told me
where to go.
"I kind of did the same thing on Matt's ship," you say, "but someone had at
least told me where to go."
"Haha," says Lily.
"But at least I had enough industry to have the navaid and jet so I could go out
by myself," Lily says. "I was so afraid that pierre would wake up and not notice
I was outside."
Lily says, "He'd likely realize we had dropped out of the rift though."
"I didn't even know how to work those tools!" Lily exclaims.
'Yeah, I'm sure he would have.
"Yeah, I'm sure he would have," you say.
"You'd have thought that as much information I found in my instructor's
notebooks," says Lily, "that I'd have found that out."
'Well, when the drive brok down in Matt's ship, I repaired it and then had no
clue where to go to catch up with Akemi. I kept the same heading and just hoped
she'd come back for us.

'er, broke
You say, "Er, broke."
'Then I did my first approach with no assistance.
"Then I did my first approach with no assistance," you say.
"So long of the short is I think that although for really smart new pilots,"
says Lily, "exposing them to the rift and to exploration as soon as possitle is
a great thing, still, they need to understand what is required and what they may
deal with out in deep space."

You nod.
'I had to figure out headings and directions on my own
You say, "I had to figure out headings and directions on my own."
Lily says, "Me too."
Lily says, "It took me a few attempts to put up some of the beacons out there."

Akemi's ship a bunch of times."
"All of those League pilots and Annie referred to a chart but nobody ever shared
it with me until I saw it on a coffee table in Melinda's Galleon so I copied it
to my filing computer," Lily says.
'Nice. I've never seen the chart they have.
"Nice," you say. "I've never seen the chart they have."
"I gave you a copy," Lily says.
"If you don't have it anymore," says Lily, "I'll give you another one."
A short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a plastic flower with red petals.
"I don't rely on it though," Lily says. "Everything I do is in my head."
'oh, hmmm. I don't think I have it still. I'll look for it though.
"Oh, hmmm," you say. "I don't think I have it still. I'll look for it though."

[Starship "Intrepid"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
