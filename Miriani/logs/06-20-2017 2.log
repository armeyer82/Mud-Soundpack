00:00:15 Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

00:00:29 Rogue Romano says, "Well, I hafta watch and be judge of that."

00:00:30 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Definitely the best in shoveling shit."

00:00:51 Rogue Romano says, "If your rear bounces while shovin', then I suppose you be grand."

00:00:54 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

00:01:08 Cheri says to Ather, "I mean that in the worst... I mean best possible way."

00:02:42 Rogue Romano grins.

00:03:07 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

00:04:54 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

00:08:54 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:10:38 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

00:10:38 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yep, I said thaty."

00:10:39 Cheri Lindbergh says, "That."

00:10:41 Cheri Lindbergh finishes off a glass of cold fizzy cola.

00:45:54 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

00:51:17 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]

00:51:17 Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a magician's top hat, 
00:51:17 and Manx the little calico CatBot here.

You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

00:51:55 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

00:52:48 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

00:52:58 Listen. You need to be careful.

01:00:54 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

01:06:55 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:12:55 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:26:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:26:36 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:26:44 Jason Rat says, "Hello."

01:26:54 Jason Rat asks, "Cuddle snuggle fest, y'all got a room here, right?"

01:26:55 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:27:47 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:27:57 Lily Kaise says, "Guess we will ride that storm."

01:42:55 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

01:43:31 You should keep your room locked while you sleep.

01:44:10 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:49:17 Ather Jammoa looks at Melinda Michaels thoughtfully.

01:49:20 Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:49:26 Ather hmms.

01:52:35 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

01:54:33 Remember what I said.

01:54:43 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

01:54:55 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

01:56:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:59:38 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of sweet red pomegranate juice.

02:01:54 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters into the room.

02:11:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "I wasn't awake for it but that's what it says."

02:11:20 Morris Corlew nods. "Wasn't sure I was understandin it right."

02:11:36 Eli Grey says, "Apparently it was a gassy ball of gaseous gasses."

02:11:42 Morris Corlew grins at Eli Grey.

02:11:48 Eli Grey says, "I blame him."

02:11:49 Eli Grey points at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

02:12:11 Morris Corlew asks, "Has he had that baked bean thing out again?"

02:12:25 Eli Grey asks, "Baked bean.. thing?"

02:12:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:12:39 Morris Corlew nods. "It's...a belt or somethin? Dispenses baked beans."

02:12:48 Morris Corlew says, "Maple baked beans."

02:12:59 Lily Kaise says, "Well he has an interesting cannon thing too."

02:13:06 Morris Corlew says, "Ah, maybe that's it."

02:13:13 Morris Corlew says, "Been awhile since I've seen it."

02:13:39 Eli Grey whistles. "Nouveau Quebec sure is a... unique kind of place.'"

02:13:46 Morris Corlew grins.

02:13:57 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:16:04 Eli Grey asks, "So we're about 820 lightyears from home?"

02:16:15 Eli Grey says, "Or is my math wrong again."

02:16:23 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey. "Yep."

02:17:44 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

02:17:50 Eli Grey stretches.

02:18:02 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:18:03 Eli Grey says, "'m still debatig whether I'm going to try to go back out with you folks right away."

02:18:15 Damien Goss asks, "Hmm?"

02:18:29 Aisling the Fox asks, "Go right back out when?"

02:18:34 Eli says to Damien, "Oh, Nissi was saying that she's planning on going right back out if things permit, we're supposed to spread the word I think."

02:18:41 Damien Goss says, "Oh."

02:18:43 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

02:18:52 Rogue Romano says, "Should put it on the board."

02:18:55 Damien Goss says, "Good thing you are spreading the word, cause I hadn't heard that."

02:18:59 Damien Goss gives Eli Grey a thumbs up!

02:19:05 Eli Grey says, "I just figured it had come up by now."

02:19:10 Rogue Romano says, "Mel mentioned it the other day."

02:19:20 Lily Kaise says, "Need to reset things and go check to see if 28t asteroid processor needs rebuilt but would love to go back out."

02:19:28 Lily Kaise says, "285 that is."

02:19:36 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh. I do not think I will be able to do that. Odds are I will be trying to get to home ship before another trip like this."

02:19:37 Rogue Romano nods.

02:19:48 Eli nods to Aisling and says, "I believe she wants to wait and see what's going on with you first."

02:19:57 Rogue Romano nods.

02:19:59 Aisling the Fox says, "Ah yes. Okay then."

02:20:01 Aisling the Fox nods.

02:20:10 Lily Kaise asks, "Any idea which direction this time?"

02:20:17 Rogue Romano says, "Not a clue."

02:20:22 Aisling the Fox points vaguely off into space.

02:20:24 Aisling the Fox says, "There."

02:20:27 Eli Grey grins at Aisling the Fox.

02:20:27 Lily Kaise says, "That works."

02:20:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:20:31 Rogue Romano says, "Thatta way."

02:20:33 Rogue Romano nods.

02:20:38 "Always." Morris Corlew points vaguely off into space.

02:20:39 Eli Grey says, "Yep, just out into the unknown."

02:20:39 Morris Corlew grins.

02:20:40 Jason Rat says, "Go find the rest of the Fox."

02:20:42 Jason Rat applauds sedately.

02:20:57 Jason Rat hugs Aisling the Fox.

02:21:43 Aisling the Fox wraps her arms around Jason Rat, pulling him close.

02:21:46 Aisling the Fox kisses Jason Rat.

02:22:15 Jason Rat kisses Aisling the Fox.

02:24:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:24:34 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

02:25:23 Lily Kaise says, "Evenia will be happy as I have a butterfly wings Maxwell for her. I actually have two but they are both blue and think she wants at least two different colors."

02:25:28 Eli Grey says, "Ugh, I hate seeing things like that truck in the rift."

02:25:30 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:25:33 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

02:25:34 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:25:41 Morris says to Eli, "How come?"

02:25:52 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

02:26:33 Eli says to Morris, "Too similar to what our ship has become.. can't help but think of some ship lost in the rift."

02:27:05 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "Hmm. Hadn't thought about that before."

02:27:29 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:27:30 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:27:35 Eli Grey says, "Not even sure how such a thing could happen, but the thought always creeps in there."

02:27:51 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey. "An interestin thought."

02:27:59 Eli Grey looks at Morris Corlew thoughtfully.

02:28:13 Morris says to Eli, "Hmm?"

02:28:20 Eli Grey asks, "Anyone ever counter.. oh I don't know, some hitchikers?"

02:28:28 Morris says to Eli, "Sorta..."

02:29:12 Eli Grey says, "Probably best to try not to think of such things."

02:29:17 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

02:30:23 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

02:30:44 I don't understand that.

02:30:46 I see no "lily" here.

02:34:15 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly, indicating that it has begun receiving a message.

02:34:15 The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."

02:40:32 Eli Grey says, "Ooh,  someone here could bethe winner of an amount of credits less than what we'll probably earn from this trip."

02:40:40 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:40:43 You chuckle.

02:40:58 Morris Corlew says, "I...hope I haven't guessed the next letter."

02:41:00 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

02:41:09 Rogue Romano asks, "I think its I?"

03:14:46 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps imperatively, indicating that it has finished receiving a message.

03:14:46 The computer announces, "QE message from AFW Command received."

03:14:49 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

03:15:11 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

03:15:16 Nissi Valdaire glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:15:47 A Tardick lizard named Raissa blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:15:49 Nissi Valdaire asks, "They're just letting IFS sit over Earth?"

03:16:06 "My guess is they're unable to deal with it?" Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Maybe?"

03:16:14 Morris Corlew says, "But...they can't just...sit there."

03:17:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "No. They'll fortify with bases and then... who knows, I don't think they've ever been just left alone over a planet before."

03:17:18 Morris rubs his temples.

03:18:18 Morris Corlew asks, "Can they use their LRL's on planets? Like...hit targets on the ground?"

03:18:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "I dunno."

03:18:40 Morris nods slowly.

03:18:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "I guess this is what we get from Libs being in charge of everything."

03:20:31 Damien Goss waves to Melinda Michaels.

03:20:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh damn."

03:20:43 Morris Corlew nods.

03:20:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:20:54 Vernos Bailey says, "Guess they thought we were close by."

03:21:09 Eli Grey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:21:17 Morris Corlew says, "Or don't think they can handle it in the two days that was the ETA we gave 'em. Who knows."

03:21:26 Eli Grey shrugs.

03:21:40 Jason Rat glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:21:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Well, 29 IFS is a lot. It's good to know that information."

03:22:00 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

03:22:09 Vernos Bailey says, "Wonder if they cleared it."

03:22:22 Morris Corlew says, "Says in old earth orbit. Not were in though."

03:22:44 Morris Corlew says, "If they're advisin us to keep clear...seems they're probably still there best I can reckon."

03:22:45 Vernos Bailey says, "No last time I did the math we were like 850 light years away."

03:22:58 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

03:23:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "They gotta just get a cruiser up and accept they might lose it. We don't get to have every battle be a safe beacon ego boost."

03:23:06 Morris Corlew nods. "About 800 or so now, yeah."

03:23:09 You nod to Nissi Valdaire.

03:23:10 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:23:13 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

03:23:22 Eli Grey nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:23:33 Eli Grey says, "Start taking out as many as they can, it'll get easier as they go."

03:23:36 Morris Corlew says, "But that message don't sound like it's taken care of."

03:23:39 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:23:47 You say, "Sue doesn't sound like it."

03:24:06 Vernos Bailey says, "I'm sure asking if they cleared it would just cause issues."

03:24:10 Eli Grey says, "Probably need to coordinate with the navy, or dare I say even Kelsy if need be."

03:24:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Well, the navy will be there regardless."

03:24:41 Eli Grey says, "Or just wait for all the legends to get home."

03:24:44 Melinda Michaels says, "There are at least two cruiser owners showing on comm's."

03:24:47 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

03:24:58 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:25:13 Melinda says to Eli, "Waiting is what will get shit destroyed."

03:25:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Kelsey is great gentleman."

03:25:22 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

03:25:37 Jason Rat cheers.

03:25:37 Morris says to Vernos, "I really doubt it's clear. Plus, sparin three folks to run to Accord to answer us...probably not the greatest idea."

03:25:40 Jason Rat removes a semi-transparent egg from a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks.

03:25:49 Melinda Michaels glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

03:25:59 Jason Rat removes an efficient round egg storage container from a midnight blue backpack.

03:26:02 Jason Rat puts a semi-transparent egg in an efficient round egg storage container.

03:26:04 Eli says to Melinda, "Just a bad attempt to lighten the mood. Not much we can do about it for a while."

03:26:07 Jason Rat puts an efficient round egg storage container in a midnight blue backpack.

03:26:28 Melinda Michaels says, "They were hitting Luna hard for awhile."

03:26:40 Eli Grey says, "Definintely sounds like a bad situation."

03:26:41 Morris Corlew asks, "Three cruiser owners I think?"

03:26:47 Jason Rat says, "I'm sure they will figure it out, I hope."

03:26:58 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

03:27:00 Morris Corlew says, "Erik, Blake, and Johann. Plus I think Libs has an org cruiser."

03:27:04 Vernos Bailey says, "Plus I think sending back is it cleared might make them think we are close."

03:27:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, I wasn't counting Blake in case he is doing his usual, I'm not really here thing."

03:27:28 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

03:27:28 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:27:47 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out.

03:27:49 Melinda Michaels says, "Or he'll take a couple Fringers in a wing and say we got it."

03:27:57 Damien Goss rolls his eyes.

03:28:04 Melinda Michaels says, "I remember when Cesar jumped him for that shit."

03:28:05 Morris Corlew says, "I'd laugh, but..."

03:28:26 Melinda Michaels says, "I called for a cruiser crew over Luna."

03:28:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "Johann won't launch anything unless he's sure he'll come out looking good."

03:28:34 Melinda Michaels points at you and points at Lily Kaise.

03:28:57 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly, indicating that it has begun receiving a message.
The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."

03:28:58 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:29:01 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:29:04 Morris Corlew says, "Part two."

03:29:07 Rogue Romano says, "If I hear word that Blake played his stupid card. I'll personally jump his ass myself."

03:29:20 Lily Kaise asks, "Huh when?"

03:29:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:29:37 Melinda Michaels says, "These two were with Blake, he was not wanting to come in. So Cesar jumped him for not defering to League pilots in League space."

03:29:45 Melinda says to Lily, "Remember that one?"

03:29:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is this where we are told they overcame earthen orbital space defense."

03:29:52 Morris Corlew says, "Huh."

03:29:52 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah."

03:30:04 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "God I hope not."

03:30:40 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

03:30:43 Rogue Romano slinks east.

03:30:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Although, if half of them are those tiny fighters launched from Chronos, is not that horrible."

03:31:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec takes a sip of a frosted square glass of sweet red caribou.

03:31:50 Morris Corlew nods.

03:32:06 Lily Kaise nods.

03:32:18 Lily Kaise says, "Could have said nvy."

03:32:24 Lily Kaise says, "Or nv."

03:32:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Navy took it out after they launched their tenth wave."

03:32:29 Morris Corlew says, "Could be Erik again."

03:32:41 Morris Corlew says, "Oh wait. Hmm. Nope, not on comms."

04:07:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Not great but decent."

04:07:33 Damien Goss asks, "Why are you speaking in shorthand?"

04:07:55 Eli Grey says, "Yeah I suppose, maye kinda of a long word choice though? Not sure what other word you could use."

04:08:01 Damien Goss says, "Oh, the device."

04:08:54 Eli Grey says, "Ather told me that I could make use of my time more efficient if I eliminated vowels from my vocabulary."

04:09:04 Morris Corlew laughs.

04:09:10 Vernos Bailey chuckles.

04:09:47 Damien Goss says, "You probably won't have any lengthy conversations though."

04:10:08 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

04:10:10 Vernos Bailey says nothing.

04:10:17 Vernos Bailey says, "They would be rather short."

04:10:33 Eli Grey laughs.

04:10:36 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah, folks wouldn't understand a word you were sayin hardly, so would probably just walk away."

04:10:38 Morris Corlew grins.

04:24:58 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:26:36 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

04:26:58 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:31:10 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

04:31:20 Morris says to Sarah, "You can review the history."

04:31:42 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh..."

04:31:45 Morris Corlew says, "But it says 29 IFS in Old Earth Orbit. Keep Clear."

04:32:18 Eli Grey removes an empty sample container from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

04:32:18 Eli Grey puts an empty sample container in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

04:32:21 "Yep I see that. So what's our new plan?" Sarah Bellamy nods.

04:32:35 Morris Corlew shrugs. "No changes as far as I know."

04:32:48 Eli Grey says, "Well, looks like we're going back to that Earth-like planet and start a new life."

04:32:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:32:51 Morris Corlew says, "Sounds like they took care of it, but the Navy took heavy losses."

04:32:55 Morris Corlew grins at Eli Grey.

04:32:59 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:36:59 You're really alone here. So very alone.

04:37:20 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

04:37:42 Sarah Bellamy gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

04:37:52 Sarah says to Morris, "I see you. I'm not alone."

04:37:57 Morris Corlew nods to Sarah Bellamy.

04:40:40 Sarah Bellamy says, "Night."

04:40:45 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Rest well Goss."

04:40:58 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

04:41:11 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:41:13 Sarah Bellamy says, "He wastes no time."

04:41:15 You say, "Night all."

04:59:16 Remember what I said.

04:59:26 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
05:30:45 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

05:44:44 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

05:54:35 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

06:01:25 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

06:01:35 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

06:36:38 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs here.

06:42:10 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

06:49:55 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night Bob."

06:52:39 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

07:02:54 The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.

07:03:44 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

07:03:54 Listen. You need to be careful.

07:28:59 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night Vern."

07:29:12 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Vern, just snore back and wake him up."

07:29:14 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well when you all decide to search for it."

07:33:45 You're not imagining it. This is real.

07:36:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Cheri."

07:44:14 You're really alone here. So very alone.

07:54:19 Is it really worth it? This?

08:04:41 Remember what I said.

08:04:51 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

08:28:58 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

08:39:13 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

08:49:27 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

08:56:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

08:57:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:58:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

08:59:46 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

09:05:11 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

09:05:21 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

09:05:55 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

09:35:12 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

09:45:42 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

09:56:16 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

10:06:21 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

10:06:26 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

10:06:36 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

10:36:27 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

10:46:43 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

10:57:03 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

11:06:53 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

11:07:03 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

11:36:54 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

11:47:13 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

11:57:36 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

12:07:53 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

12:07:55 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

12:08:05 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

12:37:56 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

12:48:16 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

12:58:31 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

13:08:36 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

13:08:46 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

13:28:48 The ship moves through a yawning metal gateway, and suddenly fire belches forth from beneath the conveyor belt, making the air shimmer with heat.

13:28:48 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

13:28:49 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

13:28:51 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

13:35:35 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:38:34 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:42:27 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

13:49:35 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:51:41 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:55:55 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

14:01:07 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

14:09:48 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

14:10:02 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

14:10:13 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

14:13:39 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

14:16:06 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

14:18:35 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

14:30:35 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

14:33:13 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:37:45 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:37:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:37:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

14:37:58 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

14:38:05 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

14:40:12 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo, nice."

14:40:42 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

14:43:29 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

14:46:56 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

14:49:53 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

14:52:00 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

14:54:35 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

14:57:41 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

14:57:48 The quaking stops and the gashes in the ground close up. The platform's violent shaking eases.

14:57:51 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

14:58:42 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

15:06:43 I don't understand that.

15:08:52 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

15:19:05 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

15:29:15 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

15:38:25 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

15:38:35 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

16:08:26 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

16:19:02 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

16:29:09 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

16:39:21 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

16:39:30 Listen. You need to be careful.

17:09:20 There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that you are a failure.

17:19:40 You're really alone here. So very alone.

17:30:09 You're really alone here. So very alone.

17:40:13 Remember what I said.

17:40:23 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

18:10:14 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

18:20:55 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

18:31:05 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

18:41:22 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

18:41:22 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

18:41:33 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

19:11:23 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

19:21:47 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

19:32:06 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

19:41:36 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

19:41:47 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

19:58:42 [MTTS] blindbat84: That awkward moment you knock on a ship just before it lands...

19:58:57 [MTTS] something: Entering it before it lands is more awkward.

19:59:11 [MTTS] Squidmind: I suggest not entering a ship until it lands then.

19:59:19 [MTTS] something: It was an accedent at the time.

20:01:19 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

20:01:19 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

20:01:54 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

20:01:59 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "10.28."

20:02:41 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else comin for outside?"

20:03:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Steppin out."

20:05:32 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

20:05:42 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

20:05:42 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

20:05:52 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

20:35:42 A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.

20:45:56 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

20:56:39 The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.

21:07:25 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

21:07:49 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

21:07:59 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

21:37:51 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

21:48:17 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

21:59:09 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

21:59:32 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Common Knowledge.

22:00:47 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

22:09:22 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

22:09:32 Listen. You need to be careful.

22:11:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

22:17:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:27:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

22:39:23 Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.

22:49:30 You're not imagining it. This is real.

22:59:51 They talk about you when you are asleep, you know.

23:09:40 Remember what I said.

23:09:50 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

23:39:41 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

23:40:59 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

23:40:59 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs here.

23:40:59

23:41:10 Board what?

23:41:12 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Aft]

23:41:12 You see a small bubbling neon blue-lit toroidal aquarium containing blue and red aquatic life and round rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go north, east, and west.

23:41:15 You can go out.

23:41:18 You already have a small suitcase.

23:41:37 Remove what?

23:41:39  You are wearing a black shipsuit with silver trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of white socks. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case.
