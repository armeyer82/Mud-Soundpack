Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array." here.
You can go south and out.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of

and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Site 194577828; Surface] (inside a battlesuit)
You stand on the surface of Teslaworld. The levels of radiation and magnetic
flux here play havoc with your battlesuit's electronics, obscuring all input in
shifting levels of white noise. The sky is obscured by dark purple clouds, which
flash several times a second with bolts of lightning. Markings on the ground
show that this area has already been explored.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.

[Starship "Kartal"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person star limo "Mrrp?", the two-person light transport "Debhauler",
the two-person star limo "Taximonster", the five-person strike gunboat "Kartal",
and the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 514" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,
and down.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless pastel purple cotton top with a three-button front
and v-neck trimmed with tiny embroidered flowers, a pair of white low rise denim
jeans, and a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and
waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a fresh raspberry pastry in her right hand, and a mug of hot
rich Colombian coffee in her left hand.

[Notification from Starseekers] A salvage op led by Damien Goss has been
completed using a Starseekers-sponsored salvage canister.
[Notification from Starseekers] The organization has gained 6 megacredits from
the completion of a salvage op led by Damien Goss.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Thanks for the op, Damien."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Sure, we won't have another op
station up for a while I think cause of the expedition and stuff."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Nice job."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "37 mill for that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Why not?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, 465 pays about twice as
what it pays in belt of orion."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The debris is twice the grade
too, though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...stupid question. Where
was the op from Orion? One East or One west?"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "East. 025 is west."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "One east."
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "Whatas up morse."
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hold on a second..."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "There you go, ali."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Does anyone have an urgent need
for me to replace the salvage and broadcast stations in 134, right now or can it
wait until tomorrow?"
[General Communication] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Okay I really need to
stop looking for the status thingy in my starship."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think it can wait until
tomorrow. What are we going to do with the ones in 465?"
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "Hello!"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I'll be replacing asteroid,
salvage was just for the ops."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Unless enough want me to rebuld
the salvage out there too?"
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "Beep. Beep. Beep. Boop."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I can imagine we might not get
enough interest for ops while the expedition is away."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Agreed."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...I wasn't quite where I
thought I was. It's all good. Thanks for the op, folks. And if you need help
with stations, let me know. I've only done it once, and that was without a jet,
but probably a reminder is all I'd need."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I love the salvage out there
better than belt of orion, but you shouldn't listen to me."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "Hello out there."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Oh I fully agree Kim, I'm on a
break from salvaging for a little bit. Salvaging for 50 command points has been
somewhat trying, heh."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have no doubt there, plus you
have belt of orion for that."
[Hyperwave Relay] Akemi Bando transmits, "Hello!"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And you might see a lot less
from me for a little while, starting somewhere in a few days, so hence the
comment about not listening to me."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Oh ok, well have a good trip or
whatever it is that you will be doing."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Nothing really so fancy, just
pondering to take a little break."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Those can be quite necessary
at times."

A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils
and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light
green sea fern.

[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Demarco!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anybody interested in roids?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am always interested in
roids."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yours or mine? You've probably
got a better engine, but if we take mine, it means I pay the toll."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Mine. Definitely a better
engine."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And battery...all that stuff
that gives you better speed."

having fallen into disrepair in the past, in their worn and dirty brick facades
and crumbling ornamental designs, New Phoenix's businesses displaced by the war
have begun moving in, rejuvenating the entire area. New offices now occupy the
old buildings, and even though outward repairs have begun only slowly, the area
already has a bustling atmosphere. A leveled building has been replaced with a
small plaza. A small hair care shop has recently opened here.

Though not completely restored, the old office buildings along this part of
Japan Boulevard are already home to new businesses. Two new shops are directly
next to each other in the same building: 'Freneza,' which has in its front
windows displays of hosiery, belts, and odd-looking bracelets; and 'Studdedly,'
which occupies the corner of the building and advertises with hand-made signs
its low-priced stock of wrist bands and chokers. A number of glum and edgy
people seem to hang around these shops, their spiked hair and unique dress
setting them apart from the usual shoppers.

New, upscale shops have moved into the renovated buildings at this intersection,
including a store with a huge black and white sign over it, reading, 'Voxy
Babes.' To the southwest is American Avenue, unscarred by the war and home to
the wealthy AEU elite. To the west is Japan Boulevard, which looks to be clean
and well-built. From this easternmost part of the city, one has a fine view of
the ocean.

an old but ornate building on the south side of the boulevard that is now

This block of Japan Boulevard has recently begun a commercial rejuvenation.
Where it was somewhat rundown before the war, the infusion of money from private
businesses has brought a new atmosphere of bustle and success to the area. On
the lower floor of a brick building on the northern side of the street, a
delightful-looking breakfast restaurant with a large plate glass window in the
front has just opened. 'Colt's Kitchen and Catering' is painted across the
window in cheerful red letters. The Boulevard continues both to the east and
west.

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
