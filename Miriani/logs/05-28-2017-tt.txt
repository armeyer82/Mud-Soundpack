Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers &
Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold
fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, and a pair of baby blue
leather clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes here.
You can go south and down.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest

Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and
pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a body-skimming neon purple racerback tee, a pair of blue low
rise denim jeans, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing
an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet
of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[0m19:39:36[0m
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is
detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The
transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Lily Kaise giggles.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers &
Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold
fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle

You peer down...
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, a small seashell pink trash can, a clear plastic food storage container,
an insulated purple cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a compact red
refrigerator, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white
microwave oven here.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

[Space Market]
This is an orbital marketplace, connected to others like it through a series of
wormhole shunts. These same wormholes are the reason such marketplaces are not
allowed to operate on planets or large space stations. A computer interface
provides access to buying and selling on the marketplace, and a large chute
underneath it allows items to emerge as they are delivered via wormhole.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation
order is entered."
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm!
Welcome to home space!"
The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" has launched
from New Earth.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
E:!(dy.%P0'Bc7Too7mvg\HCVwmQvcl0yl:8P\)P
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Tlazacani"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Damien Alexander (AEU Utility Combatant)
This is a fairly light battlesuit, painted dark green with silver trim. It
resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's
torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of hydraulics and
cables with some protective plating. A minidrone applicator is attached to the
left wrist, a hose leading to a bulky device on the back of the suit. A large
subsonic projector is mounted to the left shoulder. A laser attachment is
mounted to the right wrist.
It is destroyed.

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Know it all Morris
accused me of not firing torps but I was on the heavy vessels and you know i'm a
light grid user."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I jsut didn't choose
to argue with him because I know better and I know which weapons to fire on
which."
tra org Wow, 
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Wow."
tra org Yeah, he is such a know-it-all.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, he is such a
know-it-all."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "He clearly got
confused because Kim only had chains in room 3 but I was definitely firingtorps
but I kept missing."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Shows his lack of
experience as an engineer."
tra org Yeah, he probably did. Exactly.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, he probably
did. Exactly."
tra org Did he listen to the ship's weapon sounds? If you were firing chains,
he'd have been able to hear it too.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Did he listen to
the ship's weapon sounds? If you were firing chains, he'd have been able to hear
it too."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have no idea but
when Jason asked for chains I was definitely using chains and when he said
torps, I was. I really don't give a shit though as I know that I fired the right
weapons and Jason didn't even say to use torps on the last warship and It was
moving around like crazy so it was difficult with torps which is another issue
at times. Sometimes, as you know it's better to use a faster weapon but of
course I used torps on that one. I'm just saying."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "He irritates me when
he makes assumptions without asking first."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Are you all still
working on that nest?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Who would like to have a large
bell-shaped amethyst Jullybulb. First one who answers, I'll send you the egg."
[General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "I."
[General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Me."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn, wasn't quick enough."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Do you have an aquarium?"

as a lead.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, he does make
assumptions. We're done with the nest, but Alko sucks as a lead."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes."

or anything. So never mind."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot
here.

[Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small
purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed
