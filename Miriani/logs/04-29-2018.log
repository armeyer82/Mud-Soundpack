The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

21:08 #$#soundpack_pong

21:08 #$#soundpack_lag 116

21:08 [Newbie] Adara Blake: Does it just mean building rooms?

21:08 [Newbie] Renee Chance: You can get furniture for it as well and bolt it in there.

21:08 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: If you donate to the game, you can buy an apartment on Empanda. These apartments, you can customize by submitting your own written-in description for them. Otherwise, you are limited to the menu system of the other apartments, and you can buy furniture and decorations.

21:10 [Newbie] Cody Meynoso: I strongly advise donating If it's with in your abilities. It helps with maintaining the surver, and you are able to get a lot more custom items.

21:12 #$#soundpack_pong

21:12 #$#soundpack_lag 113

21:12 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: And the number of custom items you can have.

21:12 [Newbie] Noah Navarro: Planets and moons allow outside rooms.

21:12 [Newbie] Noah Navarro: And outside themes, for that matter.

21:12 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: What does that mean, outside rooms?

21:12 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: Uh... Rooms that are outdoors like streets? Rivers?

21:12 [Newbie] Katherine Sanders: Don't houses do that too? I mean you have a yard and stuff.

21:12 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: Ah, ok. Got it. Cool.

21:12 [Newbie] Katherine Sanders: Or can have.

22:29 [Newbie] Cody Meynoso: That's an ic question.

22:29 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: Try map landing or walk landing.

22:29 [Newbie] Thomas Anthony: No mapping.

22:29 [Newbie] Taleila Castle: Won't work. Its damn hard. Get someone in character to come find you.

22:29 [Newbie] Chet Daniels: Then ask on Chatter to see if anyone knows off hand. Either that, or explore.

22:30 #$#soundpack_pong

22:30 [Newbie] Cody Meynoso: Yeah, then you have to ask someone on chatter or private comms.

22:30 [Newbie] Thomas Anthony: And walk gives: you're on your own here.

22:30 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: My advice, then, would be to explore, or ask IC if anyone can help. The former is probably more fun, though, if frustrating.

23:34 You hear the distinct hiss of water being pumped through the ship's piping. Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

23:34 You feel a mighty shaking as something seemingly large impacts the hull.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras

You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.
