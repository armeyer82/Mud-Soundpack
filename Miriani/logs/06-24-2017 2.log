01:48:19 You are carrying nothing.

01:48:27 You scramble to your feet.

01:48:27 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.

01:48:33 You sit down.

01:48:33 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

01:48:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:48:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:48:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:48:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:48:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:48:42 The ship is already moving.

01:48:49 The ship is already moving.

01:48:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:48:50 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:48:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:48:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

01:48:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.
The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt holds you in place.

01:48:56 You're already sitting.

01:48:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:48:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:48:58 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:48:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

01:49:00 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:49:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:49:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:49:03 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:49:06 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Shooting Star! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

01:49:06 I don't understand that.

01:49:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:49:08 Starships In Sector:

Oh Lordy, The Lasers!...................(15, 13, 12)

01:49:10 The computer reports that the five-person gunship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

01:49:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:49:14 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:49:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Shooting Star. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

01:49:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:49:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:49:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:49:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:49:37 Your ship 'Shooting Star' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:49:40 The reactionless drive of the vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

01:49:41 Morris Corlew exits from the vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'".

01:49:41 The vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

[Starship "Stormbringer"; Weapons Room Two]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:18:12 Katina Faye

02:18:13 She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has caramel skin. Her body is voluptuous with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and a large bust. Her face is heart-shaped and lovely, with a button nose and elegant fine chin. Her lips are full soft and applied with strawberry-flavored lipstick, and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and almond-shaped, and enhanced with black eyeshadow. Her waist-length, straight hair is shiny black and hanging in a smooth fall, the ends slightly curled under. She has oval light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a finely crafted diamond choker, a black silk tanktop, a delicate chain of tiny aquamarines around her waist, a pair of skinny blue lowrise jeans with black and sapphire blue jeweled teardrops on the front and back pockets, and a pair of black silk stilettos. She is also wearing a mood ring, a pair of earrings with delicate diamond rosebuds suspended from tiny silver studs, a black silk handbag embroidered with crimson dragonflies, and a pair of magnificent glossy dark brown eagle wings. Her head, face, both eyes, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

02:41:13 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The four-person light carrier "Lunch Box" and the five-person mass production scythe "Stormbringer" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and Vim the mound of parking tickets here.

02:54:23 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

02:54:23 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad. The hatch appears to be locked.

04:22:49 --

04:22:49 Hey Nissi, I had a great time during this last Expedition. I sure wish that I could be available moreso. Shule and I are still interested in another trek to wherever! So please let either of us know when to be ready to roll out! I think I have covered most aspects of infrastructure which needs to be amintained for our newer pilots. Would love to grab some felo chow at the last moment plus a couple other things. However, none of that is absolutely necessary and we're ready to fly after resetting our robots whenever you are. Thank you for the last Amazing trek out yonder! As Ather hinted though I would love to go attempt to meet those clans above Farport or anywhere you would love to go. Oh by the way, I was amused by Aisling who wanted to make it a project out of not wanting to invite me on her next project. I'd love to experience a Genship but I consider Aisling to be a rather unstable individual from past experience. Therefore, it does not sadden me in the least to be unwelcomed by her. - Lily

04:38:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

06:12:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:12:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:12:35 Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates a solar system may also be in this cluster.

06:14:28 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

06:14:28 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

06:22:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:22:38 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

06:22:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

06:22:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:22:47 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

06:22:47 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Meh."

06:22:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:22:53 You pull a large lever towards you.

06:22:54 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.

09:12:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Is Lillian still alive?"

09:49:58 [General Communication] Pilot Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Take care."

09:57:36 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

10:01:29 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Pizza Party Like A Rock Star". The organization has earned 714,582.97 credits.

10:01:36 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

10:07:36 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

10:09:10 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Any imager builders awake?"

10:09:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I don't see one. But pop Nicolette a letter. She'll do it."

10:10:12 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Good deal. Not even sure why 'm worried about it right this second."

10:10:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nicolette. Melinda. Or I think Ather."

10:10:27 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ot like I'm going to take off tonight, although I thought about it."

10:10:44 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Are you not going with Nissi, Eli, or is Nissi not going now?"

10:11:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "As far as I know,  it's on hold indefinintely."

10:11:15 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Unless there's been more new about it today that I missed."

10:11:16 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Oh okay, I didn't know. Glad I know now."

10:11:29 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Well you already know more than me."

10:11:48 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think she's waiting to find out what's going on with Aisling first."

10:11:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Everyone leaving again so soon? I know nothing of this."

10:11:58 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Ah okay, that actually makes sense."

10:12:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nor me, we're obviously not in the right clique."

10:13:19 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, it's just something that got talked about on the way back. I don't think it was ever anything concrete."

10:14:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I didn't mind missing that trip, I was new as Whip then anyway, but it would be good to get on one again."

10:14:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If I wasn't voice, I'd consider it."

10:14:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Going away for five days is one thing, but I wouldn't go longer."

10:15:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's why I didn't mind missing that trip."

10:17:34 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm going to start running some shorter trips like that soonish, and I plan on trying ot take some folks that may not have gotten to go out that much, as long as there's no trouble."

10:18:06 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah gasps. "Eli. I have never, ever caused trouble."

10:18:13 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Morning all."

10:18:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Awesome, and, I totally agree about the no trouble thing, I've held my tongue many times for the sake of trip morale, believe me."

10:18:23 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Will still be a while though, getting a ship to take more than a couple of people takes a bit of time."

10:18:27 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Morning."

10:18:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes, it does."

10:18:37 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Morning Nate."

10:18:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Heya Nate."

10:19:00 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What's up."

10:19:07 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I could get the ship, well without long range sight seers anyway, but not most of the gadgets."

10:19:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Eli. That's just not good enough. I expect the ship ready tomorrow. To leave on Monday."

10:19:17 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

10:19:21 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

10:19:32 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Why not now, eve?"

10:19:56 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Why even give him a day. That's just to much time. These pilots be lazy if you give them to muc htime too do things."

10:20:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Who has access to a ship we could go on? Let's leave, like right now."

10:20:06 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm not that much of a bitch."

10:20:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Platform, let's go!"

10:20:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

10:20:35 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Ok, lets go."

10:20:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Let's do it."

10:20:53 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Like, this is me being serious. That would be amazing."

10:21:28 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Do it, just go exploration crazy!"

10:21:36 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met all our goals! Let's keep up the good work!"

10:21:38 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Blow all your creds right now on upgrades."

10:22:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No no. I like my creds right where they are. I have plans for them."

10:22:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nothing stopping anyone from just using regular sightseers on a platform."

10:22:36 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I thought about doing it, but decided to be patient and use long ranged ones."

10:22:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "But for exploration, there's so much I can't get, trading trips and things, fine, but actual exploration? Not yet."

10:22:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Indeed there is not. That's the ship I've done most of my exploration in. It's reliable, and doesn't drift all that much."

10:23:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And I can't get even the forecaster or QE yet."

10:23:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In saying that though. I also spent like a month in a mod transport. So really. It depends what you need and want."

10:24:05 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You don't realy need those, only if you are going on some huge trip."

10:29:42 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I wanna get a turbine on this thing heh."

10:29:51 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "A what on what?"

10:30:14 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "A turbine on a long-ranged sightseer."

10:30:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I wish I had a clue how much benefit you get from those, in the rift."

10:30:42 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What does the turbine do?"

10:31:46 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's the flowmill charge turbine. Basically it augments your charge while you are int he rift so that you have a large more charge while you are rifting."

10:31:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Extends your charge, but only in the rift, and the faster you go, the better it works, great for capsules."

10:32:19 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Love that idea."

10:33:04 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Keep in mind that it's not actually charging the battery, just using power from the turbine to assist in powering your systems, which results in you having a higher overall charge."

10:35:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 26,111,111.11 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Sinek".

10:35:36 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo stares up at you for a moment, then says "Mrr" and wanders away.

10:35:52 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "There we go."

10:36:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What the fuck, was that an overdriven?"

10:36:14 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yes."

10:36:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "How close were you to popping?"

10:37:02 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hull 30."

10:37:09 [General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "2 warper corvettes, a gilgamesh, 2 warships, and an escort."

10:37:23 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "The Gilgamesh took forever."

10:37:35 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good morning."

10:38:29 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Good money too."

10:38:47 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Mornin Boss."

10:38:56 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "How many points did I get from that I wonder."

10:39:10 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What kind of ship did you fly it in?"

10:39:17 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "A corvette."

10:39:36 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

10:39:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wow, we already made both goals? Wow!"

10:40:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Everybody's probe and image points came in, and I believe Ather had lots of belt points."

10:40:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "All that useles exploration."

10:40:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. useless."

10:41:36 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Beacons?"

10:42:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Can I say this over an open channel? Best is nuts. Now he is even stopping our scientists from being inducted into the EAOS. He and his party really think the AEU can stand on its own."

10:43:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, useless exploration that just helped us discover a few planets capable of sustaining life."

10:49:18 [MTTS] manny447 has joined the channel.

10:54:32 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Ok, proven. I can't pilot scoops today."

11:11:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

11:13:36 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

11:17:36 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

11:21:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

11:21:36 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on Lily Kaise's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.

11:23:44 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "League."

11:23:44 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

11:24:15 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Woo."

11:24:28 Minor Change: Impossible beacons should now be more impossible, and ship AI marginally smarter and more difficult to exploit.

11:25:08 [MTTS] Butchulla: Nice hosts, I like it.

11:25:12 [MTTS] andawn: Impossible beacons? Asuming you mean very highs and overdrivvens, right?

11:25:22 [MTTS] ricolachen: Very highs aren't impossible.

11:25:36 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

11:28:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

11:32:27 [MTTS] andawn: What beacons where being talked about?

11:32:36 [MTTS] Squidmind: Overdriven.

11:33:18 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "What kind of mission is the one where you collect RATS antennae? He said ground, but it doesn't seem like that's right."

11:33:22 [MTTS] Squidmind: You're welcome to attempt them. But if you pull it off, tell us exactly how so we can fix it! That's what overdrivens boil down to.

11:33:39 [MTTS] andawn: Wait, so they're ment to never be done?

11:33:50 [MTTS] Squidmind: Indeed!

11:34:38 [MTTS] nadira: Then, if they are not meant to be done, why do they exist? Or maybe that is a stupid question?

11:34:40 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "Never mind, I figured it out."

11:34:51 [MTTS] andawn: I was thinking the same thing.

11:35:47 [MTTS] Squidmind: Because if they're ever accomplished, then we know something about the system can be exploited, and then we can patch that up and fix the combat system gamewide.

11:37:19 [MTTS] Squidmind: Sounds sort of dystopian, doesn't it?

11:37:28 [MTTS] andawn: Kinda.

11:37:43 [MTTS] Butchulla: I like it. But then, I'm strange.

11:37:55 [MTTS] andawn: So do I. It's called, bug finding.

11:38:21 [MTTS] nadira: Right.

11:39:16 [MTTS] andawn: I know once I axxidentally typed 5 instead of four when I had no idea what I was doing. That was, not fun.

11:39:35 [MTTS] Butchulla: Hey, if it helps to improve the combat system, or patch up any issues, I'm completely down with the idea. This game's combat is amazing.

11:39:44 [MTTS] andawn: It is.

11:40:20 [MTTS] davetaylor: It is. Sometimes it's actually too intensive for me, and I've ended up going to bed with a bad back and head ache, but most of the time it's fun.

11:40:25 [MTTS] Squidmind: Let's not go too far. This combat system is old enough to vote and originated on a graphing calculator.

11:40:53 [MTTS] Butchulla: Maybe so, but it kicks butt over most of the combat out there in other games.

11:41:04 [MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed.

11:41:10 [MTTS] andawn: Agreed.

11:41:36 [MTTS] Butchulla: Just proves my point that old code, is sometimes better than new shiny code.

11:41:38 [MTTS] andawn: I prefer vector-baced locking to coordinate-baced locking, even though I did used to use coordinate things.

11:42:45 [MTTS] andawn: Slightly off topic, but it's amazing just how different sc and sc clasic are.

11:43:39 [MTTS] Squidmind: Sometimes I forget everything we've redone or added since reopening. It's a very different game these days.

11:44:04 [MTTS] davetaylor: Did Classic come back again? I never did get chance to see it.

11:44:36 [MTTS] andawn: I started here, and I thought, wahat was sc like. Found the info for clasic, connected, and was like, wait, where did my tracking go? Where did my cannons go? Chainguns? But I love how the story backs up all these changed with ic reasons.

11:44:44 [MTTS] Butchulla: You guys have done and still do an amazing job. I come back day after day, for that exact reason. This is a hell of a good game.

11:45:08 [MTTS] davetaylor: I am so invested in this game, there's always something to work towards, that's worth doing the work for.

11:45:15 [MTTS] Squidmind: It's been up for some time. But it occasionally breaks and we pay absolutely no attention to it. It's mostly there as a curiosity. I don't think anyone really plays it.

11:45:39 [MTTS] andawn: I do, actually. Sometimes, anyway. Just because I like comparing the two.

11:46:05 [MTTS] davetaylor: Last time I tried it was during the hosting problem, I think I lost the info.

11:46:39 [MTTS] Squidmind: Port 7888, I think.

11:46:48 [MTTS] davetaylor: Thanks.

11:46:54 [MTTS] Butchulla: Only trouble I have is figuring out the date in game, that sometimes causes slight disasters.

11:47:26 [MTTS] andawn: I just run off the date that I am on now.

11:48:12 [MTTS] Butchulla: For me, the game date changes at...I think 10 AM my time, so that can confuse things. I sorta wish we had something that showed the in-game date, so confusions like that didn't happen.

11:48:34 [MTTS] andawn: I am currently one hour in front of game time, normally I am right on it.

11:49:07 [MTTS] davetaylor: Same, and that's sometimes one of my issues, things happen very late at night for us, so I'm already tired when they start.

11:49:19 [MTTS] andawn: Same.

11:49:42 [MTTS] andawn: Not to mention I take sleeping pills. Once i've had them, I'm out.

11:49:45 [MTTS] davetaylor: IFS at 1 AM is not fun.

11:54:52 [MTTS] andawn: This may not be something I should ask, and feel free to completely ignore my question, but were there any plans to ever bring ginu back into the picture? Or from an ic standpoint, are they just subjegated completely.

11:55:42 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches in from the north.

11:59:49 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo rubs up against a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, purring softly.

12:03:54 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches out.

12:09:30 [MTTS] ricolachen: I was AFK for a while, did anyone else get like 5 to 6 traceback during the maintenance?

12:09:50 [MTTS] ricolachen: Not sure if it was me or gamewide.

16:01:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of skinny blue low rise jeans, a lavender lace demi bra, a pair of lavender leather boots, a lavender hoodie with a gold 'XX' embroidered on the front, a pair of soft lavender silk bikini panties, a pair of white socks, a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, a pair of white cotton briefs, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.

You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

16:08:19 You remove a small suitcase from a leather briefcase.

16:08:22 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

16:09:04 I see no "sneakers" here.

16:09:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

16:09:06 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:09:48 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Where?"

16:09:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

16:09:50 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, Xavier the old big silver soldier felo, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.

16:09:55 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

16:09:55 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:09:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:09:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:09:59 You sit down.

16:09:59 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

16:10:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:10:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:10:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:10:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:10:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:10:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:10:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

16:10:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:10:20 The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt holds you in place.

16:10:21 You're already sitting.

16:10:21  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

16:10:22 You are carrying nothing.

16:10:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:10:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:10:24 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:10:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

16:10:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:10:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:10:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:10:29 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:10:32 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Shooting Star! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

16:10:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:10:40 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Earth."

16:10:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:10:48 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:10:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Shooting Star. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:10:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:11:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:11:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:11:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:11:04 You scramble to your feet.

16:11:05 You exit the capsule.

16:12:17 Johann Schraft says to Melinda, "When Evenia had maggie, I brought my feathered over to play. He kept following her around. It was cute."

16:12:31 Melinda Michaels grins at Johann Schraft. "I love the feathered ones."

16:12:33 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Non Serviam".

16:12:41 Johann Schraft says, "Maggie is adorable."

16:12:45 Melinda Michaels says, "She is."

16:12:59 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

16:15:21 You peer out...

16:15:21 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
Lexie Amarras is standing here.

16:15:53 Lexie Amarras just arrived.

16:15:57 You say, "Oh."

16:16:02 You say, "Not anymore."

16:16:05 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Bessy".

16:16:06 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Who has the best eng stuff?"

16:16:10 Johann Schraft grins.

16:16:16 Morris Corlew says, "Mel's the best engineer there is."

16:16:23 Melinda Michaels says, "So I've been told."

16:16:24 Johann Schraft says, "Mel, Shule, and I probably have the best eng stuff."

16:16:25 Nathaniel says to Melinda, "Ok then, you ok with eng?"

16:38:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:38:47 The ship is already moving.

16:38:49 The ship is already moving.

16:38:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:38:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:38:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:38:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:38:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:38:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:38:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:38:58 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:38:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:39:00 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:39:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:39:03 The starship is already moving.

16:39:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:39:03 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:39:04 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"

16:39:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:39:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:39:14 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:39:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:39:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:39:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:39:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:39:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:39:30 You scramble to your feet.

16:39:31 You exit the capsule.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

16:39:31 You can't go that way.

16:39:32 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

16:39:32 You can go up.

16:39:33 Your ship 'Shooting Star' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:39:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

16:39:34 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:39:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

16:39:35 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

16:39:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:40:03 Lily says to you, "Hi there love!"

16:40:08 You smile.

16:40:19 You exclaim, "It's my favorite woman in the universe!"

16:40:22 You're already sitting.

16:40:25 Lily Kaise asks, "So you all only did one beacon?"

16:40:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

16:40:32 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:42:59 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior pulsates gently.

16:43:41 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

16:44:35 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

16:44:45 Lily Kaise

16:44:45 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless lilac cotton top with scalloped edges, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic pho
16:44:45 ne holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

16:45:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:46:08 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

16:47:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo seems to be hungry.

16:47:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo approaches a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

16:50:59 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

16:51:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

16:52:59 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

16:53:40 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "People, we need to help Starseekers get rid of the furnace charging systems that we used to put on the salvage stations. While I like that method, we opted not to put them on for the benefit of the newer pilots. However, we are going to put them on the BAS. So, when you do beacons, please grab your ship debris and drop it there to help us feed it. You won't get paid for this. But it's this or they go back on the salvage stations, your choice."

16:54:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo."

16:54:21 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That's not a bad idea."

16:54:36 [General Communication] Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I like that idea. Then you wouldn't have to continue rebuilding the BAS."

16:54:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. I don't have a problem goin back in if I can't salvage with the ship I'm in either."

16:54:52 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Those furnaces are expensive and Starseekers tried to keep ahead on them so we need to help them unload them."

16:55:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Just remember to help us keep it full."

16:59:01 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Non Serviam". The organization has earned 92,048.22 credits.

16:59:59 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the south.

17:00:59 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

17:05:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We should what?"

17:05:22 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Er, should've done with the furnace rechargers..."

17:05:28 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What?"

17:05:36 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Should put them on the asteroid hauling station with the asteroid conversion thingy."

17:05:45 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You've got people hauling asteroids pretty much roudn the clock."

17:05:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Folks'd fuss."

17:05:57 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh yeah."

17:06:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sometimes there's nobody out there for days at a time."

17:06:32 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I hadn't thought of that though."

17:06:51 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If memory serves, with the asteroid conversion thingy, it just takes one asteroid."

17:08:46 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was actually sort of hoping that they would actually start trying to teach themselves proper rift navigation, but oh well."

17:09:08 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So was I but I didn't figure they'd work with us."

17:09:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Right. Folks have fussed about where 287 and 002 are."

17:09:35 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "People have become lazy, I've always pretty much said that. Too dependent on the beacons etc."

17:09:47 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ather's point was, what are people gonna do if there are no beacons for whatever the reason. I happened to agree with him and oh my god did they wig out."

17:09:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:09:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

17:10:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh, I agree with ya both. They're nice to have, but if I have to get to the Bubble without 'em, which I have, it can be done."

17:11:02 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

17:11:06 Lily Kaise glides out.

17:11:08 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

17:24:06 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

17:24:06 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

17:24:31 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I think t:ey'll p/obably snatch Lily up as their Public Relatio`s Officer like yesterday."

17:24:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

17:24:53 Lily Kaise says to you, "Are you up for going out to the bubble? Otherwise, I am going out there but would be a long walk home for you if you don't want to be there hehe."

17:26:08 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

17:26:22 You ask, "Sorry?"

17:26:50 Lily says to you, "Are you up for going out to the bubble? Otherwise, I am going out there but would be a long walk home for you if you don't want to be there hehe."

17:26:58 You say, "Oh, sure."

17:27:02 You grin.

17:27:28 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

17:27:52 You kiss Lily Kaise.

17:28:33 Lily Kaise says, "I don't think there is a recharging station but we have a few days on here anyways so don't need it."

17:28:39 You nod.

17:28:49 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

17:28:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:29:07 Lily Kaise says, "We'll even see if we can run discovery proves on it too."

17:29:11 Lily Kaise says, "Probes."

17:29:16 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:29:19 You grin at Lily Kaise.

17:29:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:29:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:29:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:29:33 Lily Kaise says, "Will go gr'hmm."

17:29:37 You say, "Ok."

17:29:54 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm debating on whether or not to grab a pizza or two I think I will."

17:30:01 You smile.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:30:06 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Colonial Gate."

17:30:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:30:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:30:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:30:12 Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial Gate station is now largely irrelevant, but still stands guard here as a sort of watchtower.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:30:18 The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life, with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Centauri in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:30:20 Via general sector communication, Centauri transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"

17:30:25 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

17:30:26 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Centauri.

17:30:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:30:32 Not much to see out there.

17:31:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:31:03 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:31:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:31:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

17:31:12 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

17:31:17 I don't understand that.

17:31:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:31:20 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:31:22 You kiss Lily Kaise.

17:31:23 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:31:25 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

17:31:25 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:31:26 Lily Kaise glides out.

17:31:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

17:32:00 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches south.

17:38:01 You smile at Lily Kaise.

17:38:05 Lily Kaise asks, "Where did she say to meet?"

17:38:11 You say, "Probably Old Earth."

17:38:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

17:38:19 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

17:38:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:38:19 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Old Earth I presume?"

17:38:29 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes."

17:38:35 You say, "There we go."

17:38:48 Lily Kaise says, "Ne to change my points not asking you too just I want to."

17:38:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:38:52 Lily Kaise grins.

17:38:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

17:38:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:39:04 The ship is already moving.

17:39:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:39:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:39:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

19:54:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:54:39 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

19:54:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:54:51 Morris Corlew lopes in from the north.

19:54:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:54:56 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:54:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:54:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:54:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:56:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Thanks."

19:56:17 You peer out...

19:56:17 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person light transport "Jack Of All Trades" and the five-person strike gunboat "Morning Dove" are landed here.

19:57:22 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

19:57:25 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

19:58:00 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok I just have about a half hour before I need to go for awhile. We could head out to the bubble though if you would like to artifact while I'm away?"

19:58:20 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

19:58:31 You say, "I don't think I'll be available much to artifact. Sorry."

19:58:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

19:59:07 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ok then we'll jsut go later."

19:59:10 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

19:59:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:59:19 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:59:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

19:59:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:59:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:12:52 [Tactical Communication] Mark Washington transmits, "One IFS warship in Belt of Orion."

21:12:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:12:57 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:13:00 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:13:00 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I got it."

21:13:27 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hmm I think we can just jump on in and onward if we get hit, we won'd die!"

21:13:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:13:32 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:13:33 You laugh.

21:13:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:13:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:13:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

21:13:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:13:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:13:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:13:42 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: M7?:Rw(-M?HSq=`S{A5b<sfFZ&jSjV<h-yE"$C8&
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:13:43 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

21:13:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:13:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:13:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:13:47 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:13:48 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

21:13:48 You say, "Of course, Mr. Know-it-all has to respond."

21:13:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:13:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:13:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:13:52 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:13:52 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Orion clear."

21:13:53 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

21:13:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:13:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:13:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:14:00 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2952 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southeast and Slightly Down."

21:14:00 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

21:14:01 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:14:02 The computer reports that the one-person fighter "Bull In A China Shop" has jumped out of the sector.

21:14:03 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

21:14:03 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 183,005.49 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Beta 287. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

21:14:04 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:14:14 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:14:14 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:14:15 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:14:16 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:14:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:14:24 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

21:15:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:15:10 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow at least we got good flow!"

21:15:19 You grin.

21:24:03 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo seems to be hungry.

21:24:03 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo approaches a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

21:25:03 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:26:09 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

21:28:03 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches south.

22:01:11 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Try that when you're in the rift."

22:01:32 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I don't use numbers."

22:01:34 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "No. How about you do actual work, beacons, missions, salvaging, whatever, rather than sit there doing calculations we don't need? Just a thought. And you do indeed need math in the rift."

22:03:59 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "See, that's the problem with you poeple, you sit there, on your asses, and expect us, the nwer people, to do all your work for you because you cannot be fucked. Amazing plan. How about we just sit there and do nothing for once, and make you do all the work? Perhaps then you'll realise the fact that you should actually help."

22:04:03 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches south.

22:04:13 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I work."

22:04:23 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I was talking to kegan."

22:04:25 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Good lord nate, who peed in your coffee?"

22:04:35 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Sounds like a Fringe issue."

22:06:15 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Sure it does. But what right do you have to have less points than Keegan? Get to work, Owens."

22:06:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "To be fair, nobody signed a contract saying how much we have to work."

22:06:52 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We're civilian pilots, Nathaniel. Civilian. Our rights are somewhat restricted, but I still choose when I want to work and whatnot. Short of our government mandating me a minimum activity level, one which I probably already meet, I'm just fine."

22:07:50 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What right do I have to have less points? Lets just think about this for a couple of seconds. How long has kegan been a pilot? How long have I been a pilot?"

22:08:07 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Shut it Owens. You'll lose this one, pal."

22:08:19 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "How about you talk to Morris about that."

22:08:25 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Exactly! So have some respect."

22:09:14 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Dude, you went off grid a while yourself. Did you get this kind of fuckin' treatment when you got back?"

22:09:23 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I am showing respect. I haven't started screeming and shouting. I am mearly stating an opinon."

22:09:37 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You have no room to speak."

22:34:21 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "I actually might need it."

22:35:50 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Well, I'm going to sleep. If you don't need it, send me a letter in the mail."

22:35:55 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Yep."

22:43:54 Coordinate rundown:
Starships: William Dove (M) at (8, 9, 18)


22:44:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit 
22:44:02 aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
