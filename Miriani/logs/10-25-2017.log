00:46 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go south and out.

00:47 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom the droid, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Chops the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the dr
00:47 oid, Vur the droid, Kalista the droid, and Katherine the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

Lovely idea, also an option to gag it just in case, being in a room with 10 people and having them look at items would get spammy

01:07 [General Communication] Matt Valentino transmits, "Mods going on folks?"

01:07 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Hi my love."

01:07 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:07 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

01:07 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:07 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:07 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:07 You're already sitting down.

01:07 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:07 The ship is already moving.

01:07 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:07 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:07 [General Communication] Jake Billings transmits, "No."

01:07 The three-person cruiser "Bug Bumbler" has exited from Mission Jumpgate.

01:07 The four-person carrier "Transit" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:07 The computer reports the four-person carrier "Transit" is one unit away from this ship.

01:07 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:07 The starship must be in space.

01:07 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:07 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:07 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:07 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:07 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:08 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:08 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:08 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

01:08 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:08 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:08 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:08 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

01:08 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:08 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

01:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

01:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:08 > (Pinnacle; Atrium) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Pinnacle.

01:08 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:08 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

03:34 --------------------------------------------------
Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it li
03:34 ke any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

03:36 Sort
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  sort [container | me | here] 
  autosort [container | me | here]

Description:
  Allows you to change the order in which objects appear within a container, in the room, or the order in which items you're wearing appear. If you use the SORT command alone, it will prompt you for the exact order in which you wish everything to appear. If you use the AUTOSORT command, however, it will attempt to make a best guess at how things should be arranged. This typically involved clustering similar objects together and ordering everything by how 'advanced' it is. It's recommended to use SORT over AUTOSORT.


Examples:
  To sort your clothing: sort me
  To sort your furniture: sort here
  To sort your backpack: sort backpack

1.) Real Name:

2.) Date of Birth:

3.) E-mail Address:

4.) Characters (past and present) on Miriani and the original Star Conquest (not Catalyst):

5.) Programming Experience (no experience programming is necessary to build, but it's nice):

6.) Why do you think you would make a good host?

7.) Please describe a spaceport for the Hale Collective. Try to keep it a reasonable length.

8.) Please describe a small clothing store for the AIE.

9.) Please describe a starship store for the Commonwealth.

10.) Please describe a room of your choosing. It must fit into the Miriani setting.

11.) Imagine you are the only host connected and you are suddenly barraged with tracebacks. Apparently something has gone horribly wrong and ships can no longer launch. You have no programming experience. What do you do?

12.) How would you respond if somebody assisted about a lost ship?

13.) What would you do if somebody were to assist and inform you that they lost points and would like them returned?

14.) If you are made a builder host, what do you plan to build?

15.) Finally, please include any additional information that you feel would be helpful in our decision making process.

16.) Please be aware that, if you are made a host, there are strict guidelines that you MUST follow AT ALL TIMES. You will also not be compensated in any way for your effort (except the wonderful feeling one gets when one creates a m
15:29 agnificent area for all to explore), as Miriani is completely non-profit, and you cannot and should not expect any benefits to your player character in game. It is also worth mentioning that our system of building has been modified from that of the default LambdaCore. If you do not wish to take the time to learn this system, please @abort now and trash this application. Also please understand that anything you build will become the property of Toastsoft and you should not expect it to be removed if you demand it. Do you understand this? Please respond with yes or no.

15:46 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Desolo Island; Sandy Clearing.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very 
15:48 particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it like any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

Room Poses
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  ROOM-POSE [pose | clear | off | <player name> | <object name>]

Description:
  Room poses allow you to include custom text after your name, or an object's name, in a room's description. Ideally, this would be text indicating your default position in the room. You might be leaning against your starship, curled up in a ball in the corner, idly twirling your hair, splayed out in a chair, etc. They should not show continuous action, like spitting on the ground, doing pushups, running around in circles, etc.

  Room poses can contain object names and, for convenience, the game will automatically match to objects in the room if you use a dash in front of a partial name. For example, if you want to indicate that you're standing with one foot atop a large book in the room called 'a tome of lore and longwindedness', you wouldn't need to type out the entire name of the book. Instead, you can simply type: -tome

  We ask that players be mature and courteous with the use of this command. Anybody walking in off the street will see this text, so please keep it tasteful. You should absolutely avoid and, if seen, REPORT any offensive room poses or people abusing it to mislead other into believing that another player (or even the player themself) is doing something that they cannot or should not be doing. If you find that somebody is matching your name in the room in a way you believe to be inappropriate, you can dissolve their room pose by typing RPOSE <player's name>.

  The ROOM-POSE command with no arguments will display your last five room poses for convenient recall if you should move to another room. 

  The PEOPLE command can be used to see how your pose will appear to other players. To do this, you need to supply an argument to the command. For example: PEOPLE ME

  The ROOM-POSE command can also be piped through the E2 command, allowing you to announce to the room at the same time as you change your pose. The syntax for that can be slightly complicated, so here is an example demonstrating how to show the room that you're leaning against a wall: E2 leans against the wall. | rpose leaning against the wall

  You can also use room poses on objects. The same restrictions apply to objects that apply to your own room pose. Additionally, objects with room poses must be bolted down. In order to apply a room pose to an object, you must have the same permissions that are required to bolt objects down. Generally, this means that you must own the room in which you're posing the object in or otherwise be authorized to control the room. The syntax for this is: ROOM-POSE <object name>. You will then be prompted for a pose. To close an existing pose, hit enter at the prompt.

Restrictions:
  * If you have something after your name in parenthesis, your pose will not appear. Th
15:49 is prevents overriding pre-programmed systems with custom text.
  * Your pose will clear every time you enter a new room. However, the ROOM-POSE command maintains a memory of your last five poses.
  * You can't use another player's name after a comma or the word AND to prevent tricking people into thinking they're doing something that they aren't.
  * At present, you're limited to 100 character poses.
  * Poses cannot contain parenthesis.
  * If you're found to be abusing the command, you will have your ability to use it revoked.

Example:
  ROOM-POSE leaning against the wall
  ROOM-POSE standing with one leg atop -tome

Grouped Room Poses
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  GROUP-POSE

Description:
  Grouped room poses allow you to assign a single room pose to a number of different objects. This prevents redundancy in the room description and lets you do things that you wouldn't ordinarily be able to do with standard groups.

  To start, you will want to create a new pose. You can use the GROUP-POSE command or, for short, GPOSE. This will open a simple menu of choices. Choose the "New Group Pose" option and type in your pose. For our example, we'll say: "piled in front of a control console"

  The next question asks if you want the pose to appear before or after the list of objects. If you say before, then your pose will be printed first and then the objects after it. (e.g. a heavy blanket covering <objects>.) If you choose after, then the opposite will be true. For our example, we'll choose after.

  Once your pose is created, nothing will happen at all! Not very useful. So go back into the GPOSE command and select the pose you just created. This will present you with a new menu that allows you to add objects, remove objects, change the pose position (before or after the object list), edit the pose, or delete it entirely.

  After the objects have been added, LOOK and you will see that they're now all together and associated with the pose you set. That's all there is to it!

  NOTE: If you want pose
15:51 d objects to appear on their own line, you can do so from the ROOM-OPTIONS command. At the time of this writing it's option 20, 'Separate Grouped Room Poses From Normal Contents'

Restrictions:
  * If you have something after your name in parenthesis, your pose will not appear. This prevents overriding pre-programmed systems with custom text.
  * You can't use another player's name after a comma or the word AND to prevent tricking people into thinking they're doing something that they aren't.
  * At present, you're limited to 100 character poses.
  * Poses cannot contain parenthesis.
  * If you're found to be abusing the command, you will have your ability to use it revoked.

15:52 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Desolo Island; Sandy Clearing.
You see an internal stun turret, three translucent red security drones, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a black rosewood end table, a shiny silver starship simulator, and a white trash bin here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

16:04 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door opens.

16:04 (Docking Bay) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" begins to slowly float through the docking bay door from outside, being carefully guided by a small army of drones and a contingent of spaceport dock workers. After several moments of careful maneuvering, the ship sets down on the docking bay floor and the drones depart with the workers.

16:04 You hear a deep rumbling as the docking bay door closes.
The computer announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been secured in the docking bay."

16:05 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:05 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:05 The ship is already moving.

16:05 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:05 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

16:05 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:05 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:05 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:05 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:05 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

16:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

16:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:05 You can only expel ships on specially equipped landing pads.

16:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:06 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

16:06 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room.

16:29 Sort
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  sort [container | me | here] 
  autosort [container | me | here]

Description:
  Allows you to change the order in which objects appear within a container, in the room, or the order in which items you're wearing appear. If you use the SORT command alone, it will prompt you for the exact order in which you wish everything to appear. If you use the AUTOSORT command, however, it will attempt to make a best guess at how things should be arranged. This typically involved clustering similar objects together and ordering everything by how 'advanced' it is. It's recommended to use SORT over AUTOSORT.


Examples:
  To sort your clothing: sort me
  To sort your furniture: sort here
  To sort your backpack: sort backpack

Tradesman Certificates
--------------------------------------------------
Tradesman item certificates are a method for a donator to redeem a request to use at a later date. Such requests are placed into a secondary queue, and do not take priority over items requested on Empanda Station. They can also be gifted to other players if you're feeling generous enough! It doesn't matter if the recipient of the gift is a donator or not. It may also be worth noting that the exchange and use of tradesman certificates is out of character, thus you can use and obtain them anywhere in the game except for locations that reside out of communications range (but can't talk about them via IC communication).
Furthermore, tradesman certificates may only be submitted once every two weeks. If you submit a tradesman item certificate and it is completed a day later, you may not submit another one for up to two weeks after that time. Rejections do not incur a waiting period.
 
Commands:
  @CGIVE <person>
Give <person> a tradesman certificate. Once you have selected a player to gift, you will be prompted for the amount of tradesman certificates you wish to transfer. You can't give more than you have in your account. Typing the command without arguments will prompt you for a player's name. Once complete, you'll see something like:
        You give 1 tradesman certificate to Mitchell Morganivich Mihola.
The recipient will see:
        Mitchell Morganivich Mihola has just given you 1 tradesman certificate.
 
  @CREQUEST
Request an item using one of your available certificates. You will be presented with a menu, similar to the one that appears in the Empanda Station tradesman concourse. You must have at least one tradesman certificate to utilize this command. For sake of immersion, this command cannot be utilized while out of communications range. Complete all tradesman requests prior to leaving local space.
 
  @REQUEST-CERT
Redeem a certificate. You will be prompted to confirm the request, and once complete, a tradesman item certificate will be added to your account.
 
  @CERT-MARKET
Enter the tradesman item certificate marketplace. You can sell or buy tradesman certificates here for credits. The command may be shortened down to @CM for brevity. Be warned that trades are not audited by the Toastsoft hosts. Confirm at your own risk!
You may also type @CM [on | off] to connect or disconnect from the tradesman market channel. Notifications of new and completed sales are announced here.
 
  REQUESTCHECK
See if you're eligible to request a donator item. Note: similarly to the commands above, this command is out of character.
 
Notes:
* Tradesman certificates are attached to your account, not your character. This means they stay with you through rerolls.
* If your request is rejected, you will receive a tradesman certificate redemption token in the mai

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.

17:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:16 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:17 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:17 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:17 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:17 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:17 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:17 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:17 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:17 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:18 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:18 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:18 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

20:08 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

21:22 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
