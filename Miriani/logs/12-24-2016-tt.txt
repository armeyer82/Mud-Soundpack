[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a
wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic
life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid service robot, a robotic chef named
Nellie, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a small purple
trash bin, and a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt here.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster

You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach
to Old Earth.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Urgent!
Important! Please do not dock with Earthgate station. there is a light
infestation of bari on the station. For your convenience this station is
equipped with a League repair module. Again, you will almost certainly be
infested with some bari should you land on Earthgate station, dock here if you
need repairs."
Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet
elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never
actually set foot on it.
Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, William Dove!
Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"
[Miriani] [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: If he got the points for that.

[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a

Ali Candan presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
DC'YduUhulkw+h[pv.+I9\!$Mu<Iup~5gvwu/~'`
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Akemi Bando moves in from the south.
Ali Candan presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

equipped with a League repair module. Again, you will almost certainly be
infested with some bari should you land on Earthgate station, dock here if you

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
