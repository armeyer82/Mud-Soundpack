00:29:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:29:26 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:29:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:29:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:29:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:29:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:29:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:29:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:29:34 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:29:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:29:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:29:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:29:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:29:41 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

00:29:42 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:29:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:29:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:30:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:30:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:30:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:30:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:30:24 You say, "Be right back."

00:30:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:30:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:30:30 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

00:30:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:30:32 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:30:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:30:34 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

00:30:35 You scramble to your feet.

00:30:35 Mischief the large black felo slides to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:30:35 You exit the ship.

Please do not enter so many commands at once.

00:30:46 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.
You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Ground Squad Leader]
You see the Ground Squad Leader terminal, a large metal filing cabinet, a white corduroy sofa with a dark green and white striped throw pillow with silver fringe and a dark green and white striped throw pillow with silver fringe on it, and a small mahogany trash bin here.
You can go west.

00:30:56 I see no "report" here.

00:30:57 You grab the door handle as you leave.

00:30:58 The door to the east suddenly closes.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

00:30:58 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:31:05 You frown at the one-person cargo hauler "The Gimbled Ghost".

00:31:09 You key in a transport of William Dove to your location.

00:31:09 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:31:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

00:31:11 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot, Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo, and Mischief the large black felo here.
You can go south and out.

00:31:20 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:31:34 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

00:32:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar". The organization has earned 543,232.44 credits.

00:33:36 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:33:37 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

00:33:40 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

00:33:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:33:44 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

00:33:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:33:46 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

00:33:50 You laugh.

00:33:51 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:33:54 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:34:01 You're already sitting.

00:34:04 I don't understand that.

00:34:06 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:34:08 Lily Kaise asks, "So how's my outfit?"

00:34:13 Lily Kaise

00:34:13 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a silver and green shipsuit with the AEU logo centered on the chest and a pair of pleated silver silk pumps. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
00:34:13  'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

00:34:27 "Very nice!" You grin at Lily Kaise.

00:34:42 Lily Kaise says, "Well I would rather wear some boots but I think those are all black."

00:34:53 Lily Kaise says, "Be right back. Will go see though."

00:34:55 You say, "Ah, well. Those shoes work."

00:34:55 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:34:57 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:34:57 You nod.

00:34:58 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:35:34 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

00:35:39 You stroke the soft fur of Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo.

00:35:39 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand.

00:36:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person morningstar "Lord Of The Wasps".

00:37:18 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:37:19 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

00:37:24 Lily Kaise says, "These go better."

00:37:27 Lily Kaise

00:37:27 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves.

00:37:30 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:37:39 You say, "Oh, definitely."

00:37:41 Lily Kaise says, "Not as dressy but they're more suitable."

00:37:41 You grin at Lily Kaise.

00:38:03 "I like it!" You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:38:08 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

00:38:24 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I'd love to wear this shipsuit more often but I wouldn't wear it in unregged space."

00:38:29 You nod.

00:39:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-s

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

00:39:08 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:39:36 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

00:40:32 Lily Kaise says, "Wow I thought I transferred over there."

00:40:42 You say, "You did."

00:41:28 Lily Kaise says, "Well it seems no points went to myself or the org."

00:41:34 You say, "Oh weird."

00:41:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah definitely."

00:41:43 You say, "I saw the notification that you contributed to the org."

00:41:50 You say, "The credits anyways."

00:41:53 Lily Kaise nods.

00:42:05 Lily Kaise says, "But the points didn't change and I turned in 24 artifacts."

00:42:10 You say, "Wow."

00:42:13 You say, "Weird."

00:42:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah definitely as I didn't turn those in until after I had changed my contribution."

00:42:40 You say, "Huh."

00:42:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar". The organization has earned 743,696.89 credits.

00:42:58 Lily Kaise says, "So even if I were capped which I don't appear to be, the org would have gotten half of them."

00:43:11 You say, "Yeah."

00:43:22 Lily Kaise says, "So that was a waste of my time unfortunately darn."

00:43:28 You say, "Awww. I'm sorry."

00:43:29 Lily Kaise says, "I'll be right back."

00:43:31 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:43:32 You nod.

00:43:32 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:43:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:43:36 Mischief the large black felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

00:43:42 You stroke the soft fur of Mischief the large black felo.

00:43:42 Mischief the large black felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

00:43:46  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case.

00:49:16 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

00:49:24 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

00:49:31 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah no points for those. I don't understand even a quarter of apoint."

00:49:37 You say, "Wow."

00:49:42 You exclaim, "That is really strange!"

00:50:37 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:56:38 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

00:56:39 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:56:50 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

00:59:36 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Mischief the large black felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

01:07:36 Mischief the large black felo gazes at Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

01:07:37 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps down from your lap.

01:08:37 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

01:08:50 Lily Kaise says, "Ok kim stop obsessing I believe everyone who is around has committed to hearing you ramble about nothing for an hour and a half."

01:10:01 You nod.

01:10:37 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:23:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:24:30 Constantine Stone says, "I should have got us a cake."

01:24:33 Constantine Stone says, "I thought about it."

01:24:36 Constantine Stone says, "But I did beacons instead."

01:24:41 Constantine Stone finishes off a delicious scone.

01:24:42 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "It's all right."

01:24:47 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders glances down at her silver watch with a round face momentarily.

01:24:47 Constantine Stone says, "Next time."

01:25:13 Lily Kaise waves to Constantine Stone.

01:25:24 Constantine says to Lily, "Hi, Lily."

01:25:32 Constantine says to Lily, "How are you?"

01:25:46 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

01:25:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders transmits, "5 minutes or so until the start of our meeting, for anyone who has lost track of the time?"

01:25:52 You say, "That darn cargo hauler is still on the landingpad."

01:25:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Doing great!"

01:26:01 You say, "And powered up."

01:26:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it is and very concerning."

01:26:22 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I have written to the liaison office yesterday morning."

01:26:34 You say to Kim, "Oh good."

01:26:37 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "You'd think they could have done something about it?"

01:26:42 You say, "Yeah."

01:26:57 Constantine Stone puts a cup in a shiny green trash bin.

01:27:04 You say, "Last thing we need is New Earth to be infested by bari."

01:27:38 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "What gets me, the rare occasion I forgot to power down a ship it powered down automatically about an hour or maybe 2 after completing it's recharge. So how is this on our landing pad for several days?"

01:27:49 You say, "Yeah, great question."

01:27:51 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I don't understand this at all."

01:28:02 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I didn't know they powered down automatically."

01:28:09 You say, "They usually do."

01:28:11 Lily Kaise says, "Something has heppened to it's power lever apparently."

01:28:12 You say, "After a time."

01:28:13 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

01:28:53 Constantine Stone nods.

01:29:11 You say, "Obviously, they don't always or this one would have powered down a long time ago."

01:29:15 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Where you at, Eli?"

01:29:16 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "No, that is still a long enough time to spread bari infestations around the place."

01:29:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hold up I'm coming."

01:32:22 Eli Grey says, "Glad I could make it."

01:32:28 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

01:32:28 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders smiles. "Hi Vernos and Eli, nice to see you both here."

01:32:42 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth walks in from the south.

01:32:51 You wave to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:33:01 Constantine says to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth, "Hello."

01:33:04 Lily Kaise waves to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:33:07 Eli nods in respect to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:33:19 Kim nods politely to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth as she greets him: "Welcome, thank you for joining us sir."

01:33:19 Eli says to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth, "Good evening, sir."

01:33:37 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Howdy y'all."

01:33:50 Andrew nods around to everyone and then quietly takes a seat.

01:33:54 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:34:00 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth removes a black cowboy hat from his head.

01:34:04 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says to Andrew, "A lovely cowboy hat you have on this evening."

01:34:17 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Why thank you."

01:34:21 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I think this is everyone we can expect for today? I do not see anyone else on comms."

01:34:28 Eli Grey tunes a metachannel FTL communicator.

01:34:47 Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

01:34:49 You turn general communication off.

01:34:52 Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

01:35:02 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Lemme jest say before we begin that Ah feel most blessed ta be here this evenin' and Ah am very grateful to President Best fer the oppotunity to continue ta serve."

01:35:11 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:35:18 You smile.

01:35:25 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

01:35:29 Eli Grey grins and gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

01:35:36 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders turns off a red metachannel FTL communicator.

01:35:37 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:35:40 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders closes the door.

01:36:29 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "And we are greatful for you joining us today."

01:36:44 Shule nods in agreement as he sits back in his chair.

01:39:26 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "I can hear the water running under the bridge from here its so quiet in here."

01:39:32 Eli clears his throat loudly.

01:39:37 Kim stands to address everyone in the room, glancing at everyone individually for a brief moment while she speaks: "Good evening, fellow pilots and Mr. Lambeth. Welcome to this meeting. I am glad you have all taken some time to come together and discuss some important business. At the start of this liaison term I intended to hold a meeting, intended to generally discuss the state of the corps. Vernos then came to me with a proposal which I also intended to discuss, and that we might get to today if time permits. Then a lot of us got invited for an expedition, so the meeting was postponed.

01:40:06 You nod.

01:41:21 Kim takes a breath, then continues her speech: "However, after the return of the expedition, and upon reading some of the news, several pilots expressed concerns to me about where the AEU is headed, and requested that some time in this meeting would be devoted to discuss those concerns. Considering how important this is, I suggest we begin there.

01:41:22 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey slumps in an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair and goes to sleep.

01:42:07 Andrew waves his hat to fan Vernos.

01:42:12 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I don't wanna make too many rules for this meeting, but I do ask that we all make an effort to give everyone a chance to speak."

01:42:12 Constantine Stone smiles.

01:42:22 You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

01:42:27 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:42:37 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "I would like to start with what ight be the most pressing issue."

01:43:03 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "You may, since you were one of the people writing to me."

01:43:21 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

01:43:36 Ather turns to Andrew and says, "I've had the opportunity to hear a lot of concerns from AEU pilots regarding fears that the AEU might be considering leaving the Accord."

01:43:42 Ather raises a hand as he continues.

01:43:49 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "These concerns were especially magnified, if you were, when President Best recalled our current Accord Liaison to New Earth for a debrief."

01:44:34 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "The pilots who discussed this all seemed to be in agreement that we, the AEU civilian pilot Corps submit a joint statement to the government stating that this action is an inadvisable one, owing to the fact that the Outsiders, the IFS and even the allied pirates are still a considerable threat."

01:44:43 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "You could not have taken a better point to start."

01:44:45 Lily Kaise nods.

01:44:46 You nod.

01:45:02 Ather says to Kim, "Well, like I said."

01:45:05 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "The most pressing issue."

01:45:10 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:45:33 Ather nods and sits back in his seat.

01:46:59 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah... weeeelp, Ah'm not privy to the inner discussions of the, er, administration, but Ah do know President Best has felt fer some time the th' Accord is a drain on fundin' whichfor he believes he can find a better use."

01:47:16 Lily glances down.

01:47:50 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "An' he's been sayin' such fer some time, it's no secret."

01:48:16 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "My personal opinion is, that the AEU leaving the accord is not just a poor choice, but a dangerous mistake. First of all, because events not too long ago have proven that we will only survive against our common enemies if we stand together. It also sends a very disturbing sign to the other alliances. A sign which we AEU pilots apparently have sent all too often, namely, we don't need the rest of you and we can manage alone just fine."

01:49:49 Eli nods in agreement with Kim.

01:49:59 Lily agrees.

01:50:03 Constantine Stone says, "I agree with that."

01:50:07 Shule nods in agreement.

01:50:13 Eli Grey says, "I firmly believe that, if not for the Accord, we'd all have been killed a long time ago."

01:50:24 You nod to Eli Grey.

01:50:30 Eli Grey says, "Not for a lack of AEU strength, but rather the strenghth that unity itself offers."

01:50:38 You say, "Precisely."

01:50:42 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "I fear if we pull from the accord and we get a major invasion force that if advised by their alliances that we could not recieve any assistance."

01:50:58 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah surely cain't promise a single thing but Ah can tell y'all thet this is exactly th' sorta thing yer non-bindin' resolutions are made fer. One o' those would send a message to th' administration, Ah'm sure. Whether it'll sway their feelin's at this late date Ah couldn't tell you."

01:51:09 Lily Kaise says, "And that we are willing to work cooperatively with others as we may need their assistance at some point and trust me, I believe we may."

01:51:29 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:51:32 You nod to Lily Kaise.

01:51:53 Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:53:08 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I do understand the AEU has only so many credits to spend, and president Best of course has a lot of choices to make, not an easy position. But this is not a matter of preference. This is not about luxury we are talking here, but survival of all of humanity."

01:53:22 Constantine Stone says, "If I can add this."

01:53:29 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Constantine Stone.

01:53:30 You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders. "Most certainly."

01:53:43 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe to frame the discussion in a way that the administration understands most clearly."

01:53:47 Constantine Stone says, "I do a ton of work with the accord."

01:53:49 Constantine Stone says, "We all do."

01:54:00 Constantine glances around the table.

01:54:06 You nod to Constantine Stone.

01:54:23 Constantine Stone says, "I think this gets me licenses to do more profitable work for the AEU faster, and in turn makes me a better asset."

01:54:35 Lily Kaise nods and smiles at Constantine Stone.

01:54:45 Constantine Stone says, "I think our relationship with the accord can bear some really great fruit, if we just let it be."

01:54:56 You nod to Constantine Stone. "I agree."

01:55:55 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Mr. Lambeth just mentioned a non binding resolution, which, if I remember right, means I put up a proposal on this voting machine, and we vote?"

01:56:08 Lily Kaise says, "I doubt it would fail."

01:56:13 Constantine Stone nods.

01:56:17 You nod.

01:56:17 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth nods.

01:56:24 Lily Kaise says, "I'd just prefer that we go forward with a resolution."

01:56:33 Lily Kaise says, "Or at least a statement."

01:56:44 Eli Grey says, "Perhaps to offset the issue of funding, we could all make it a point to bring more resources directly to AEU worlds. I know some pilots may not be very happy about this idea, because it would mean losing out on a bit from always transferring to temp stations and so forth, but it would allow the AEU to get more of a share of those resources, if my understanding on the matter is correct."

01:56:57 You say, "Sounds like this is a good opportunity to use a non-binding resolution."

01:57:01 Constantine says to Eli, "I think this is a great suggestion."

01:57:22 Lily Kaise says, "WEll I wouldn't mind contributing a set aside percentage of my work to augment the AEU but I don't want to defray from temporary stations."

01:57:36 Lily Kaise says, "In other words, I'd contribute personally."

01:57:36 Vernos says to Andrew, "I have a question."

01:57:39 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "This is something every single pilot can easily take to heart."

01:57:57 Eli Grey says, "I certainly don't mind forgoing some of my tax cuts from a temp station activities, if ti means we don't have to pull out of hte Accord."

01:58:00 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey. "Go ahead."

01:58:28 Vernos says to Andrew, "Did I hear correctly over the public address what is this nine years later that the spaceport is still only offering basic functions and emergency power?"

01:58:50 Eli Grey says, "I believe the announcement actually syas that it's operating at limited capacity."

01:58:56 Lily Kaise nods.

01:59:22 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey asks, "Is that a problem to anyone else in this room?"

01:59:34 You nod.

01:59:50 Constantine Stone says, "It's all I've known, but it doesn't sound great."

02:00:11 Constantine Stone says, "And I think it probably doesn't make us look good."

02:00:24 Kim looks slightly surprised as she asks: "A little off topic maybe, but yeah, after 9 years you'd think the spaceport should not still be functioning in such a state.

02:00:52 Lily Kaise says, "As well as it seems that a lot of work hasn't been completed."

02:01:05 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "President Best feels that President Garner failed to do enough to improve infrastructure all around. Ah'm sure he plans to make it a priority his own self."

02:01:21 Lily Kaise nods. "That is very good to hear."

02:01:25 You nod.

02:01:26 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "On top of the proposal I mentioned to Kim, I'd like to use this donation box over here and change it from an expedition fund to the pilots giving back to the planet by donating funds to fix issues like this."

02:01:54 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly it helps the planet and makes us look better too."

02:01:57 Eli Grey says, "The telex spaceport did get fully replaced, so there has been some progress made, but yes it would be nice to see more of it on our capital planet."

02:01:59 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I think that money was spent already, no!"

02:02:12 You nod to Eli Grey.

02:02:21 Constantine says to Vernos, "I like that idea, though I have no notion of how important the box has been to expeditions."

02:02:23 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Repurposing this box has been discussed before, but we still need to first learn whether that is possible, and what has happened with the funds from it."

02:02:32 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods.

02:02:38 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:02:51 Lily says to Vernos, "Yes I never knew that the donations box was earmarked for Expeditions per se."

02:03:02 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "And sorry it was a bit off topic but it has been bothering me."

02:03:23 Kim says to Andrew, "During our last meeting, november last year, we talked about this and you said you were going to try and find out more information for us, do you have any updates on this donation box?"

02:04:13 Eli Grey says, "It was supposed to be an expidition to survey an asteroid cluster for a new processor, but I believe the whoel thing got tied up when the Fringe claimed the cluster was too close to their space."

02:04:43 Lily says to Andrew, "Mr. Ambeth if I might ask? Would it be possible to be provided with an estimate of how much the aEU contributes to the Accord? I'm just curious as to how it does affect our overall economy?"

02:04:48 Kim says to Eli, "Oh, thanks, I was not aware of that."

02:05:34 Vernos says to Eli, "Honestly we should just work on trying to completely clear out Frontier if possible."

02:05:37 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Can we please keep this slightly structured and give Mr. Lambeth a chance to answer our questions before we bombard him with new ones?"

02:05:52 Constantine Stone nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:05:55 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:06:11 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Sorry the question was bothering me."

02:06:31 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.

02:07:37 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah know a sizable portion of th' budget is goin' to th' Accord but Ah don't have an exact number. Ah know a new budget is being discussed as we speak."

02:07:47 Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

02:07:52 Lily Kaise says, "Thanks sir."

02:09:47 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "If finances are the biggest concern with the AEU's participation in the Accord, I would not feel bad about contributing a percentage of what I earn to the accord, much like how I contribute to my organization or insurance. How do you guys feel about that?"

02:09:59 Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:09:59 You say, "I'd be fine with that."

02:10:07 Constantine says to Kim, "I think that's a great compromise and I would be happy to do it."

02:10:08 Lily Kaise says, "I absolutely support as I made this recommendation earlier."

02:10:12 Constantine Stone nods.

02:10:14 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:10:28 Eli Grey says, "I would do something like that, or even just an overall tax increase by the AEU. Again,  probably not ap popular idea."

02:10:38 Lily Kaise says, "Perhaps as pilots we shouldn't be as heavily subsidized to offset some of this as well."

02:11:35 Eli Grey says, "Perhaps a grace period for newer pilots so they can get on their feet, but us veteran pilots shouldn't have a problem paying a bit more taxes, or contributing directly to the Accord."

02:11:41 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

02:12:05 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I can put a proposal about that on the voting machine as well."

02:12:16 You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders. "That would be great."

02:12:57 Andrew scratches his head. "Yes... Ah reckon a proposal would be the first step toward any o' that."

02:13:32 Ather frowns slightly, shrugging.

02:13:48 Lily Kaise looks at Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.

02:14:22 Eli says to Ather, "I know, it's not the most desirable idea, tax increases rarely are."

02:14:26 Constantine Stone says, "The only thing I would caution is that any agreement of this kind should have some kind of end or renegotiation date."

02:14:37 Constantine Stone says, "Just a thought."

02:14:41 Kim nods 'Have we anything else to add to this topic about the..."then stops, noticing Ather shrugging.

02:15:17 Kim says to Ather, "Was there anything on your mind?"

02:15:19 Ather gestures wordlessly for Kim to continue.

02:16:20 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "I think we can move on from this particular matter then?"

02:16:26 Constantine Stone nods.

02:16:33 You nod.

02:16:43 Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:17:05 Eli Grey says, "It sounds ike we're mostly all in agreement, not on the solutions perhaps, but at least on the primary issue."

02:18:09 Lily Kaise nods.

02:18:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 171,534.73 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

02:19:12 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Another matter that several pilots expressed concerns to me about was, all the things about the AEU in the news lately. Particularly scientist Peter Feinstein renouncing his citizenship to the AEU, the matter of this other gentleman, his name currently escapes me, one day being inducted into the EAOS and the next time leaving again."

02:19:21 Lily Kaise sighs.

02:19:44 Lily Kaise says, "A huge loss for us."

02:19:48 Constantine Stone nods to Lily Kaise.

02:19:49 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Mmmm hmmmm. What y'all gotta unnerstand is... well, recall thet th' pilot corps voted unanimously for President Best. He figures he got a mandate. If'n y'all wanna try to correct thet notion... well, time's runnin' real short."

02:20:03 Eli Grey nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

02:20:08 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

02:20:10 Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

02:20:14 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods.

02:23:11 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey asks, "Sending that message is another thing for the voting machine, I guess?"

02:23:19 Kim looks around the table at her fellow pilots: "I guess we have work to do. But, how? I think Ather suggested writing up a joint statement for President Best? How would you feel about that, or do you have another angle at this?"

02:23:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:23:49 Constantine Stone says, "I think it would be good if that came from Ather."

02:23:51 Eli Grey says, "I fear that the discconection from the EAOS, and the formation of the Ministry of facts are well intentioned decisions. I fear though that it will eventually lead to us perhaps being a bit behind with scientific discoveries. Currently the other alliances are allowing their scientists to work together and thus share their results through that process. If we cut ourselves off from that, we're limiting the potential of our own scientists."

02:24:07 Constantine Stone nods to Eli Grey.

02:24:09 You nod to Eli Grey.

02:24:28 Lily nods in agreement with Eli.

02:24:30 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders smiles at Eli Grey. "Nicely said."

02:25:22 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "President Best feels the AEU don't get anythin' in return fer sendin' folks off to th' EAOS."

02:25:52 Constantine Stone says, "I think he's wrong about that."

02:26:02 Constantine Stone says, "With all due respect."

02:26:19 Constantine Stone says, "For one thing, the AEU gets glory when AEU-born scientists participate in making discoveries."

02:26:27 Constantine Stone says, "And the EAOS is where that's happening, currently."

02:26:27 Lily Kaise nods.

02:26:37 "So, we would need to work out what the AEU has gained in recent past from our scientists working with the EAOS, so we can make a case?" Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders frowns.

02:27:04 Constantine says to Kim, "That sounds like a good place to start."

02:27:09 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "President Best feels thet he needs to stop the er, what is it there, the 'brain drain' so thet some o' these discoveries can start happenin' in th' Union."

02:27:27 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I mean, not just some statement, but facts that can back it up."

02:27:31 Eli Grey says, "Man of our ships our equipped with EAOS lasers, sensors, and sometimes even hull plating."

02:27:34 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Folks can bring these discoveries back to the union."

02:27:36 Constantine Stone says, "And I think that might make sense to someone looking at academia from the outside."

02:27:47 Constantine Stone says, "But most huge discoveries are made cooperatively."

02:28:02 Constantine Stone says, "On our own we could never keep pace, simply because there are fewer of us."

02:28:02 Lily says to Andrew, "With all due respect we bring discoveries and credit to our pilits as well as we earn funds which aid the economy."

02:28:41 Eli Grey coughs. "Many,  I mean."

02:28:48 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of sweet and creamy coffee.

02:28:55 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Let's remember, Mr. Lambeth is only stating what President Best has stated before. That does not indicate whether or not he agrees with it."

02:29:01 Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:29:15 Lily Kaise says, "We are Kim. Just stating our own points of view."

02:29:21 Eli Grey says, "It's not Mister Lambeth we really need to sway."

02:29:41 Constantine Stone nods.

02:29:55 Lily Kaise says, "Well he will have heard us at least and can share our sentaments."

02:30:36 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:30:43 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "So, rift drives, sensors, hull plating, those are things we pilots and possibly the navy see some benifit too. It would be good if we could also find some things scientists working with the EAOS have achieved that helps the average citizen."

02:31:06 You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:31:08 Constantine Stone nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:31:48 Eli Grey says, "I don't believe that currently Best has much interest in rift drives, I could certainly be wrong."

02:32:18 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Eli Grey. "You are probably right."

02:32:20 Lily Kaise says, "Our earned income through EAOS-based work. Tesla for one."

02:32:27 Andrew spreads his hands. "Ah ain't tryin' ta argue, just tryin' ta... liaise... and give y'all the government's feelin's on it all. Ah say again, y'all voted fer him, those o' ya in th' corps at th' time. An' there's been several terms since he took office. Time is real short if ya wanna try ta git him to not do what he always promised ta do, is all's Ah can really tell y'all."

02:32:40 Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

02:33:03 Lily Kaise says, "I just know that most of us didn't consider that he would be this severe."

02:34:14 Kim looks thoughtful: "I am drawing a blank here. But Mr. Lambeth is right. We have little time to set this straight."

02:34:40 Constantine Stone says, "Well, it at least sounds like we're mostly united here, so we can at least be hopeful."

02:34:42 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Well I have an example that might lead into my proposal Kim."

02:34:58 Lily Kaise says, "Let's please stay on point."

02:35:06 Eli says to Kim, "Thankfully if most of the folks here vote ontight, it won't have to sit in the box long. You can close the vote quickly once we all vote."

02:35:14 Lily Kaise nods.

02:35:34 You nod.

02:35:42 Vernos says to Lily, "My example was quite on topic thank you."

02:35:50 Lily Kaise shrugs.

02:35:56 Kim says to Vernos, "Ok, go ahead, what is your example?"

02:39:36 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Well think of it this way, if we say had an alliance with the fringe, and we send scienists to work with their scientists well, we get that information and are then able to apply it here with our Worlds and even our own ships. So having scientists working outside of the union can be quite useful to the union as well."

02:41:03 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Scientists working together is how stuff gets done and honestly the union is important but the union wouldnt exist without science and the EAOS is a huge part of that."

02:41:04 Andrew scratches his nose. "Well, ta be fair, it'd be those scientists becomin' Fringe citizens instead o' jest workin' with 'em. Thet's what th' EAOS does."

02:42:04 Eli Grey says, "Oh, I thought that up until last week, Feinstein was still considered an AEU citizen, and other AEU scientists as well."

02:42:11 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods.

02:42:28 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "He had shared citizenship the way I understood it."

02:42:33 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "So a citizen of both."

02:42:46 Eli Grey says, "I'll admit, I don't nkow exactly how it all works, but I always thought that wehn they were inducted into the EAOS, still maintained their home alliance citizenship."

02:43:11 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Fienstein was somethin' of a patriot fer most of his career. He indeed worked fer th' EAOS but kept his home here, so ta speak. But no more. And thet ain't th' norm."

02:43:50 Kim glances at the room, a thoughtful expression on her face: "Yeah, if we had an alliance with... if is the issue. We do not have such an alliance, yet. And something tells me President Best needs to hear something more exact from us to change his direction than something that may happen, if both us and the other alliance can get an agreement."

02:44:09 Lily Kaise nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:44:15 Eli Grey says, "The EAOS doesn't do alliances. They remjain neutral."

02:44:20 Eli Grey says, "Er. Remain."

02:44:22 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."

02:44:56 Kim says to Vernos, "Don't get me wrong, if I had anything to say about it, we would still have full alliances with the League and the Fringe, which, of their own choosing AEU pilots before my time decided to give up."

02:45:13 Lily Kaise nods.

02:45:14 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

02:45:35 Vernos says to Kim, "It might be time to consider the negitive impact of that descision and outreach ourselves a bit."

02:46:03 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Maybe not an alliance but to let folks know that hey we arent just here to isolate ourselves."

02:46:09 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I'd love nothing else than to have better relations with the other alliances, including the Mutuality. As I said before, we only have a chance to survive against the outsiders when we are united."

02:46:30 Lily Kaise says, "At any rate new pilots especially will lose a lot if say we no longer have access to Space Vermin or Tesla and GMG and elseqhere."

02:46:57 Lily Kaise says, "'anywhere where the EAOS are sponsors."

02:49:00 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:49:14 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah believe President Best's thought is thet, if'n th' Union does leave th' Accord or rejects EAOS inductions, they can negotiate fer access to those sites."

02:49:33 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Question is, what if the EAOS says no."

02:49:46 You say, "Or the Accord for that matter."

02:51:05 Lily Kaise says, "And we'd be heavily taxed and bring less income into the alliance."

02:51:50 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:52:28 Andrew looks down at his hat and says nothing.

02:53:15 Lily Kaise says, "I'd rather that we paid the taxes to AEU and not to another entity for the use of their resources."

02:54:49 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "If I consider I can currently easily earn a billion credits in a week if I put in a bit of effort, I am really not so concerned about that. I am concerned about this alliance as a whole, not just our pilots, become more isolationist than it already is."

02:55:15 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Guys, Mr. Lambeth has told us we need to take action and I think we might be making his life harder currently."

02:55:53 Lily Kaise says, "Well that's the point of not breaking off from the Accord."

02:56:24 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I am willing to take action. Right now. I am racking my brain to figure out how though."

02:56:38 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Not harder. Jest thet Ah'm not here ta represent mah personal views an' feelin's an' arguin' with me don't have much purpose."

02:56:39 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Look. Right now, we're only talking about what is going to happen if we don't act. We're stating the problems, but no one is trying to suggest ways of solving those problems very well."

02:57:26 You say to Kim, "I thought it had been proposed for us to draft a joint statement?"

02:57:48 Lily Kaise nods to you.

02:58:02 Lily Kaise says, "I believe this is what Mr. Lambeth needs."

02:58:13 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "We could, in addition, to the polls, come up with a statement that Mr. Lambeth could present to the government on our behalf. That is not a bad idea, and Shule is right, it has been suggested."

02:59:05 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "With polls, I mean, proposals for non binding resolutions."

02:59:35 You ask, "Ok, so what exactly is going to go into the non-binding resolution?"

02:59:39 Andrew straightens up, his voice raising. "Ah don't need nothin'. Y'all voted Best in and yer gettin' what ya voted fer, if ya wanna change it now..." He sighs and lowers his voice. "If ya wanna change it now, ya cain't take any half-measures or drag yer feet. Ya gotta act."

03:00:00 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

03:00:03 Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

03:00:11 Lily Kaise says, "Fair enough sir."

03:00:39 You say, "I thought the nonbinding resolution was to express our concern that leaving the Acord would be inadvisable."

03:00:56 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to you.

03:02:35 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "We also need to respectfully and vocally send a message that he does not have a mandate."

03:02:39 You ask, "So, in adition to that nonbinding resolution, do we wantt o craft a joint statement?"

03:03:58 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Might be a good idea."

03:04:14 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Ather is right though. We all know what the problems are. We can talk about it for a few hours, we can write something up, but what can we do to actually convince our president to stop pulling the AEU into a hole it will not recover from?"

03:04:45 Lily Kaise says, "Well this is a start."

03:04:58 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "He does have a mandate. He has th' pilot vote, that's a matter o' public record. An' th' Napas have control of th' entire government. Ya gotta work within thet reality."

03:05:04 Lily Kaise says, "We can't solve all of the AEU's problems in this meeting."

03:05:11 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Well Ryo jokingly suggested a strike but that is a bit extreme."

03:05:26 Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

03:05:30 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

03:07:10 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "A strike? But y'all don't even have a baseball team. Not sure what yer talkin' about."

03:07:37 Lily sriffals a laugh.

03:07:39 Vernos says to Andrew, "I think a plot was upset with the news and suggested something extreme."

03:07:56 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I don't suppose not working for a day, a week, a month or even a year does anything to change president Best plans for the AEU."

03:07:57 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Pilot I mean."

03:08:14 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Make that, I don't believe."

03:08:30 Lily Kaise says, "I'm sure if we took such action, we'd kiss our licenses goodby. We're still sponsored by a government who would like to see us on our way i'm sure."

03:08:50 Andrew rubs his ears and glances at the ceiling. "Hmm, th' acoustics in here..."

03:09:03 Vernos says to Kim, "I agree."

03:09:05 Lily Kaise says, "Oops I mis-spoke goodbye sir."

03:09:08 Lily Kaise grins.

03:09:36 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "We have a starting point."

03:10:36 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "We all mostly agree on that starting point."

03:10:51 You say to Kim, "Aside from drafting that nonbinding resolution, I'm not sure what else we can do to make our voice heard regarding the topic of the AEU withdrawing from the Accord."

03:11:07 You say, "And also drafting that joint statement."

03:11:12 Lily Kaise nods.

03:11:17 Ather shakes his head slightly, glancing around the room, his optics unit dimming slightly and taking on a slight redish hew as he silently presses a finger to his lips.

03:12:03 Eli says to Andrew, "What kinds of things can we do in our everyday activites, to help take some strain off the funding issues? Will doing more for our homeworlds, like transfering salvage direclty to them, make a difference?"

03:12:18 Eli Grey coughs. "Activites I mean."

03:12:24 Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.

03:12:27 Eli Grey says, "Activites."

03:12:32 "But we all heard Mr. Lambeth." Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "We, or at least those of us who voted at the time, gave our support to Mr. Best to do the things he intended to do if he were elected."

03:12:54 Eli Grey says, "Activities, yeesh, I think my tongue is asleep."

03:12:55 Kim says to Ather, "Did you wanna say something, if so, feel free."

03:13:13 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Naw, transferrin' more or transferrin' to different places ain't th' kinda thing that'll hit President Best's desk."

03:13:24 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Too much is being said. Some of which should not be said."

03:13:27 Eli Grey snaps his fingers.

03:13:34 Ather looks meaningfully around the room.

03:14:05 Eli Grey says, "Definintely no more striek talk. Too many folks depend on the resources we bring in."

03:15:30 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

03:15:46 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Mmm hmmm, starvin' children need thet unprocessed ore"

03:16:51 Eli Grey grins at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

03:17:19 Eli Grey says, "Perhaps my logic is flaws. I only meant that resoruces need folks to u se them, and that means jobs."

03:17:50 Eli Grey says, "I apologize, I'm getting anxious and it's making me trip over my own words."

03:18:22 Andrew simply shakes his head.

03:18:23 Lily Kaise says, "Well workers are employed there and yes the end product is hopefully sold off or used in production which yields income to our government."

03:18:50 Ather rubs his forehead.

03:18:55 Eli Grey says, "At any rate, I still don't think a strike is a viable option, and it's not very proactive."

03:18:58 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 1,664,646.43 credits.

03:19:01 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

03:19:04 You nod to Eli Grey.

03:19:10 Ather flashes a warning look at Eli.

03:19:18 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway here we go off on another tangient."

03:19:45 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Right."

03:20:00 Eli looks at Ather with surprise and confusion.

03:20:53 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "If this is really what people want we can draft up a statement, but it's really only more words and I doubt it makes any difference."

03:20:57 Eli clears his throat and looks down at the floor.

03:21:04 Andrew pushes a fingertip into his ear and wiggles it around.

03:21:13 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth and absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:21:15 Lily says to Andrew, "I so appreciate it that you were able to come and listen to our concerns."

03:21:30 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Yes, thanks for coming."

03:22:03 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Thank you for coming."

03:22:05 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Time to end circular talk and start drafting. I think Mr. Lambeth doesn't need to be here for that."

03:22:08 "Yes, we do appreciate you joining us and clarifying various points for us." Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders smiles at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Must be tiring sometimes."

03:22:11 Eli says to Andrew, "I wonder how many times this has happened to you. Get asked to come to a meeting just to have to remind us that we have a voting machine."

03:22:16 Eli Grey grins at a cup of sweet and creamy coffee.

03:22:19 Eli Grey grins at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

03:22:48 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "In fact, I want to even take a walk and clear my head after all this. I'd enjoy company in the fresh air!"

03:23:02 Andrew nods and gets to his feet, plopping his hat back onto his head. "Happy ta attend. Sorry 'bout th' acoustics in here. Hard ta have a productive meetin' in here sometimes. But good luck to y'all."

03:23:08 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:23:10 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Yeah, maybe some fresh air is what we need. Do we close for now then?"

03:23:11 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth places a black cowboy hat atop his head.

03:23:17 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth briefly opens the door to leave.

03:23:17 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth walks south.

03:23:28 Eli Grey nods.

03:23:30 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of sweet and creamy coffee.

03:23:38 Eli Grey asks, "Well.. I guess that went well?"

03:23:38 Constantine Stone stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:23:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:23:44 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa asks, "Yes. Who'd like to accompany me on grandly delightful walk?"

03:23:47 Constantine Stone asks, "Shall we adjourn somewhere?"

03:23:49 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:23:49 Constantine Stone nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:23:53 Eli Grey nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:23:54 Eli Grey stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:23:57 Lily says to Kim, "Yes unless you would like to summarize so that we're all clear on what you will do going forward?"

03:24:18 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa takes Eli Grey into his group.

03:24:22 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa takes Constantine Stone into his group.

03:24:25 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I will summarize what is important on the message board, and hereby close this meeting, thank you."

03:24:26 Lily Kaise stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:24:34 Constantine says to Kim Saunders, "Thanks, Kim."

03:24:37 You stand up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:24:39 Constantine Stone smiles at Kim Saunders.

03:24:41 Eli Grey gives Kim Saunders a thumbs up!

03:24:41 You wave to Kim Saunders. "Thank you."

03:24:47 Lily Kaise waves to Kim Saunders.

03:24:54 Kim Saunders nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "I will come on grand stroll."

03:24:58 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa asks, "I guess no one else wants to go on grand walk?"

03:25:05 Lily Kaise says, "Sure I do."

03:25:07 Lily Kaise grins.

03:25:07 Constantine Stone says, "It's a lovely evening."

03:25:08 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Sure."

03:25:09 Kim Saunders nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "I will."

03:25:16 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa takes Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey into his group.

03:25:16 Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

03:25:19 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "I'll join in."

03:25:20 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa takes Kim Saunders into his group.

03:25:29 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of sweet and creamy coffee.

03:25:39 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa takes Lily Kaise into his group.

03:25:43 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa takes you into his group.

03:27:21 Constantine Stone asks, "How long has that been going on, then?"

03:27:26 [MTTS] Ulias: The way you guys always do accents and speech patterns is always incredible. Way to go,  for real. I'm always impressed.

03:27:26 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "You can't go spouting things like strikes and the like."

03:27:50 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Lambeth tried to warn you repeatedly."

03:27:53 Constantine Stone nods.

03:27:56 You nod.

03:28:00 [MTTS] Butchulla: 100% agreed.

03:28:16 Kim Saunders nods.

03:28:21 Lily Kaise says, "I'm sure that is what Mr. Lambeth wanted to imply and he was pretty darn cool about it."

03:28:55 Kim Saunders says, "He also made something else clear, sort of..."

03:29:00 Lily Kaise nods.

03:29:10 Lily Kaise says, "It was pretty startling."

03:29:23 Eli Grey says, "Sorry, I was only trying to reinforce that the idea of a strike was no good."

03:29:30 Kim Saunders says, "Another thing I considered and did not say in the meeting. The best thing would be, if Best was exit."

03:29:34 Vernos Bailey says, "I think we all were Eli."

03:29:35 Lily Kaise says, "Oh we all agree on that."

03:29:57 Constantine says to Kim, "But we don't have the ability to influence that, do we?"

03:30:08 Lily Kaise says, "That would be a very quick and easy way for the Government to disolve our Corps."

03:30:48 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Don't fucking get carried away. I get this room swept from time to time, but nothing is for sure. Don't say these kinds of things."

03:30:48 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 171,558.71 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

03:31:01 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:31:05 Lily Kaise nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:31:09 Eli Grey says, "I can't believe I didn't pick up on his cues."

03:31:24 Lily Kaise says, "If we ever mentioned anything like that then, you will likely get your pass to home."

03:31:46 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "For now, draft the resolutions, draft a written statement. But stop saying shit like pilot strikes, administration change etc. Anywhere."

03:32:02 Shule nods in agreement.

03:32:04 Eli Grey nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:32:13 Lily nods emphatically to ather.

03:32:26 Vernos Bailey says, "Let me ask something out of curiousity."

03:32:56 Vernos lowers his voice really low, "be honest, how many voted a certain way just to keep their license?"

03:33:24 Eli says to Ather, "No wonder you looked at me like that.. I can be so clueless sometimes. he practically did everything but say it out loud."

03:33:34 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't. I tried to choose what I honestly thought was the most appropriate candidate our of the three poor choices we had."

03:33:36 Eli puts his on his face.

03:33:41 Eli puts his hand on his face.

03:33:45 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "None. There was no pressure to vote one way or the other in the election."

03:33:52 I don't see that here.

03:33:57 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:34:05 Eli Grey says, "I,  sady, was not around to vote."

03:34:15 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't personally like any of them if you want my honest opinion."

03:34:26 Vernos Bailey says, "Well I did not vote Best in the election as a civilian but that is irrelvenant."

03:34:37 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Everyone voted for Best because quite simply, he had the best potential outcome for the civilian pilot program. Garner would've kept it close. None of you would be here."

03:34:44 Lily Kaise says, "Privatization would have just meant a slow demise of our Corps."

03:34:49 Kim lowers her voice to a whisper: "Badly enough, I took too long trying to decide which of the choices I thought was best, I liked neither particularly but best the least, and ended up not voting. I know, inactive support..."

03:34:49 You say, "Exactly."

03:34:59 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Rebane would've privatized most of it to fuck us over even worse than before."

03:35:03 Lily Kaise nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:35:07 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:35:14 Lily Kaise says, "As well as many other govermental agencies."

03:35:34 Eli Grey says, "We might have had a more reasonable President though, None of them were great choices really."

03:35:47 Lily Kaise says, "When you privitize, it goes to the lowest bidder who does the poorest job."

03:35:57 Vernos Bailey says, "Could have voted Voxel I suppose."

03:36:05 Lily Kaise grins.

03:36:16 Lily Kaise says, "It was tempting but then we'd have even more chaos."

03:36:16 Eli Grey says, "But yeah, it's beside the point, he's the President now and like Lambeth aid, we have to work with what we got now, within their world I believe was the words he used."

03:36:24 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

03:36:36 You nod.

03:36:48 Vernos Bailey says, "He did say act fast."

03:36:49 Constantine Stone says, "I think one good thing that came of this."

03:36:59 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Right."

03:37:02 Constantine Stone says, "He did mention that changing where we transfer salvage and what not is immaterial."

03:37:05 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "I have stuff to do."

03:37:08 Constantine Stone says, "So all we need to do is draft the statement."

03:37:16 Eli Grey nods to Constantine Stone.

03:37:17 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Just remember to keep your mouths shut."

03:37:20 Kim Saunders asks, "Who feels good at drafting such a thing?"

03:37:22 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:37:24 You follow Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa south.

You can go north (locked by keypad), northeast, east, south, west, and up.

03:37:35 Constantine Stone says, "I think it would be good coming from Ather, but I would trust any of you to do it."

03:37:46 Eli Grey says, "Before drafting anything, I think Kim needs to get the voting machien set up."

03:37:53 Kim Saunders nods.

03:37:53 Constantine Stone nods.

03:38:04 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly from what I keep hearing, Ather should be the one drafting."

03:38:04 You nod.

03:38:51 I don't understand that.

03:39:05 Kim Saunders says, "The last thing I drafted was, sort of reasonable. But not really good."

03:39:15 Lily Kaise says, "I would agree as Ather has more of the background and the institutional knowledge and we could at least have accurate representation of the necessary facts."

03:39:46 Constantine says to Kim, "Oh, if this is something the voice would normally draft then by all means you should do it."

03:39:51 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah please don't just reword what is already stated somewhere."

03:40:20 Constantine says to Kim, "You've been working with Lambert's office for a long time, and that counts for something."

03:40:34 Kim says to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa, "Before you just get drafted, would you be willing to write a proposal for such a statement?"

03:41:18 Kim says to Constantine, "I have been in office for like 7 months because there really were not that many other candidates. Does not mean I am such a great voice and good at writing."

03:43:47 Eli Grey asks, "I hope some consiracy nut doesn't see us all leave say i'm not even entirely sure what should go into such a document. Won't the voting results have the same effect?"

03:44:27 Constantine Stone says, "I'm not sure."

03:44:33 Constantine Stone says, "But leaving quietly one at a time, not a bad idea."

03:44:43 Constantine Stone nods.

03:44:46 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "If I was the one who was going to do the drafting, I wouldn't write the statement and just post it without corps approval."

03:44:59 Eli Grey asks, "Is the document just supposed to be what we've already stated, just made more concise?"

03:44:59 You nod to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:44:59 Lily Kaise nods.

03:45:24 Lily Kaise grins at a gold-toned engineering tool case.

03:45:27 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

03:45:29 You grin.

03:45:44 Constantine Stone says, "I think so, I think we just want to get across that we think leaving the accord and ending cooperation with the EAOS is a bad idea."

03:45:44 Lily Kaise says, "Just as long as lots of tenticals don't come out of there."

03:45:53 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

03:45:58 Constantine Stone says, "And quickly, right? Like maybe we should try to have this done by midnight."

03:46:05 Lily Kaise nods to Constantine Stone.

03:46:39 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "I can have something written up and mailed to everyone in this room within the next several hours. Afternoon at latest."

03:46:47 Lily Kaise says, "That works."

03:46:48 Constantine Stone says, "I like that."

03:46:49 Constantine Stone nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:46:52 Kim Saunders asks, "I think a vote on the voting machine needs to be up at least 24 hours?"

03:46:52 You nod to Constantine Stone.

03:46:58 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Yep."

03:47:07 Lily Kaise says, "That's reasonable."

03:47:16 Kim says to Ather, "If you would be willing to do that, we can look at it and decide the next step from there."

03:47:21 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "There is no harm in you posting a vote which simply asks, "Do the pilots believe that the AEU should leave the Accord?" Yes? No!"

03:47:33 Kim Saunders nods.

03:47:34 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I think that would be fine."

03:47:34 Vernos Bailey says, "So let ather write and lets get kim to the voting machines."

03:47:39 A full set of alien battle armor stands upright inside a large display case, like another presence in the room. One can almost imagine it moving.

03:47:47 Lily Kaise blinks.

03:47:50 Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:47:50 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "People vote on that, then that poll closes, and the joint statement by that time should be ready to post."

03:47:58 Lily Kaise nods.

03:47:58 Constantine Stone says, "Sounds like a plan."

03:48:05 Lily Kaise taps a wall-size self-lit glass display case containing alien armor and weaponry.

03:48:06 Vernos Bailey says, "Sounds good."

03:48:38 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods.

03:48:40 You say, "It is."

03:48:42 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Perfectly normal, perfectly normal."

03:48:46 You say, "I've seen it do that before."

03:48:50 Lily Kaise nods.

03:48:51 Kim Saunders says, "I suppose I hear and see ghosts everywhere now."

03:48:59 Lily Kaise says, "'It jsut startles me just a tad."

03:49:03 Lily Kaise grins.

03:49:25 Lily Kaise says, "This is ok."

03:49:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Just leave the sandwiches alone!"

03:49:41 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:50:04 Constantine Stone says, "But I think we'll have more decisions to make in the coming days, probably."

03:50:09 Constantine Stone exclaims, "But we'll see!"

03:50:10 Lily Kaise nods to Constantine Stone.

03:50:11 Ather says to Eli, "Sorry, the sandwiches were taken from future me to feed our past selves."

03:50:17 Eli Grey says, "It moved? I didn't notice it move."

03:50:20 Lily Kaise says, "Yes."

03:50:20 You nod.

03:50:28 Lily Kaise says, "He stood upright."

03:50:42 Eli Grey says, "It wasn't standing upright like that when we walked in? Hmm."

03:50:53 Lily Kaise says, "Nope well not exactly."

03:50:59 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Start leaving in ones and twos. I suppose Lily and Shule leaving together is right."

03:51:02 Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa disbands his group.

03:51:04 Constantine Stone nods.

03:51:08 Lily Kaise grins at Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:51:10 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks Ather."

13:04:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:04:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

14:39:00 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

14:39:03 Not ejected.

14:39:05 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

14:39:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Love."

14:39:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

14:45:52 Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200. At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500 Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations. I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

To Esteemed President Best and members of the AEU government:
The AEU Pilot Corps is concerned with talk of potentially withdrawing our contributions to the Accord, both in personnel and funding. We believe this to be a mistake, and strongly urge the government to reconsider this action. The threat of the Outsiders, the IFS as well as attacks by pirate factions still occur on a fairly frequent basis. The Outsiders especially, are a grave concern. They could return at any time, and if nothing else, overwhelm us all just by sheer numbers.

In order to combat the threats both within our own borders and in alliance space in general, we need to all work together. The Accord functions as a central means for all of the alliances who are involved to contribute resources and money to make those resources into something useable to combat the threats that we all encounter on a daily basis. Additionally, the Accord functions as a means of gathering the relevant intelligence which we tend to use in order to combat our enemies effectively and with minimal losses.

The AEU has some of the best scientists, who have made some incredible discoveries and helped further our efforts to combat the dangers we all face. Our navy, full of the bravest men and women in the alliance have fought valiantly in many engagements against Outsiders, IFS and even Allied Pirates. Even the civilian pilots have served in an exemplary manner, having once been
14:46:10  at the forefront of helping to defend all of the alliances in times of invasion. However, as great as our scientists are, as skilled and brave as our great men and women in the navy are and as dedicated to the defense of our space as the civilian pilots may be, the AEU cannot combat the threats to our space alone. We need to remain in the Accord therefore, to share intelligence and receive intelligence in turn. We must continue funding the Accord, so that they can continue to build the ships and weapons which we can use to assist in combatting our enemies. We need to commit personnel to help defend the space of all other alliances, so that we too can be safe. We need to allow our scientists to work with the Accord and the EAOS, so that we can continue to gain advantages over those who would desire to see nothing more than the downfall of the alliances, and more importantly, the extinction of the entire human race.

We thank you for taking the time to review our statement, and hope that you will ultimately do what is in the best interests of humanity, and our alliance.

20:15:50 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I will as usual, speculate my fist making contact at high velocity with your dumb irrelevant face."

20:15:58 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:16:07 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Too bad it's not true!"

20:16:15 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Here we go again... where's my popcorn."

20:16:51 You chuckle.

20:16:56 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 356,462.70 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

20:17:05 Lily Kaise chuckles.

20:17:16 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

20:17:32 Lily Kaise says, "Will be glad not to hear her attention-starved dribble for the time they are gone."

20:17:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:22:07 You laugh.

20:22:10 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

20:22:23 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

20:22:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:24:30 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

20:24:35 Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200. At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500 Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations. I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

20:24:59 --
I want to express to Ather that I appreciate how he phrased our
statement in such a manner in that it reflects the key reasons why
we must maintain our relationship with the Accord. I know that had
our own concerns as pilots been incorporated, that the Government
would likely discount our position as one which is merely self-
serving. This is one important factor but the over-arching points
which Ather related are the most critical.
At some point, we may be approached to provide our own
justification which relates to how, as AEU pilots, we are able to
serve our Alliance and/or the EAOS and others more effectively
through continued ties with the Accord.
Here is a listing of many of the Ship Upgrades and other Aspects
which will very much limit, if not prevent AEU pilots from engaging
in important work which not only is of benefit to ourselves in the
defense of humanity, exploration and otherwise but to yield
additional income to the AEU Alliance itself. This is by all
means, not a complete list. Feel free to enter additions to this
list and/or comments.
HULL PLATING --
EAOS Plasma Resistant Plating
REACTIONLESS DRIVE --
EAOS Dual Reactionless Mk III
MAIN SENSORS --
EAOS Superstring Perturbation Sensor
WEAPONS
EAOS CRYSTALLINE OPTICS LASER MK II
Super-Heavy Laser
EAOS ELECTROMAGNETIC TORPEDO LAUNCHER MK II
JINU SALVAGE MINIATURIZED PLASMA CANNON
SENSOR DATA --

Security Xenology Storage Container
Flight Lockers
Concerning the EAOS specific work which we all engage in from time
to time,
please consider the following --
All organizations funds are EAOS
Tolls from Travel entry points are paid in EAOS currency to
organizations as well as require EAOS Credits for payment.
We could lose access to the ability to purchase Temporary Space
Station Modules altogether if we are denied access to the
Requisition shop on Accord. We may no longer be able to
purchaseAEU cores and not to mention, new organizations may not be
able to form as we may not be able to purchase facilities for
organizations.
New pilots utilize Space Vermin Patrol to develop their entry-level
skills. It can easily be stated that SVP hasn't always been
available to new pilots b
20:24:59 ut it does present additional loss of
income from the work performed on the behalf of their sVP
trainingMissions
Accord Missions --
I don't think that I need to explain how important Accord Combat
Missions are. Dou to their advanced level, these are very
beneficial to promote better combat skills overall.
Accord Salvage Missions -- these obviously promote the
availability of higher grade debris to salvage and income to our
Alliance.
Tesla --
Losing access to Tesla would mean that Ground Combat development
would be limited moreso. There would be no means to sell and
purchase Mini Modules as well.
Loss of access to the EAOS Battlesuit. - it is possible but will
be challenging to cleanse the Old Frontier Space Station ducts
without the use of EAOS. Rats Battlesuits can be utilized but they
are more difficult to obtain.
Starshipss Likely No Longer Available --
Two-Person Accord Gemini
Module Transporters other than the AEU Space Constructor.
Beacon Decoys for Beacon drops and Launchers --
There is no facility other than Accord to purchase these items.
Note --
I am certain that this list is not complete. However, here's
something to consider if we are no longer working cooperatively
with the EAOS as pilots.

20:25:06 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Roid Seeker". The organization has earned 686,016.83 credits.

20:27:37 You put a piece of heavy white stationery with a silver AEU logo at the top in a leather briefcase.

20:27:50 You grin at Lily Kaise. "That was a good list."

20:27:55 Lily Kaise says, "Thanks."

20:28:30 Lily Kaise says, "I did think of other things though. One would pretty much say anything which is EAOS on The Torus and on Accord."

20:29:12 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "One for mother nest?"

20:29:25 You nod to Lily Kaise.

20:29:33 Lily Kaise exclaims, "These are obvious possibilities. We still can buy goods and services in Mutuality Territories so I doubt we would be cut off from everything. As I said, I'm sure they would still love our credits!"

20:29:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:33:27 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Beacons?"

20:34:20 You laugh.

20:34:33 Lily Kaise shrugs.

20:35:51 You say, "But yeah, I'm sure they would still love our credits."

20:35:56 Lily Kaise nods.

20:36:30 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Nests?"

20:36:56 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't mention the Hyperwave in the Torus Restaurant or the stuidio over there and I'm sure there's more. I'd think they wouldn't cut off access to the gift ships Felo and Fish shops either."

20:37:07 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'd be up to do one@ but I only hav% a t`er one fringe{su{t."

20:37:17 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "|e/'s .ry that again i< english."

20:37:27 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What?"

20:37:30 You nod to Lily Kaise.

20:38:47 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I might have time for a beacon or so."

20:38:57 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "One more for a beacon."

20:38:59 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

20:39:00 Lily Kaise glides south.

20:39:05 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

20:39:07 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

20:39:19 You say to Lily Kaise, "Join me for a beacon?"

20:39:29 Lily Kaise asks, "Sure as long as I can engineer?"

20:39:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:39:47 Lily Kaise asks, "Or were you just going to use the scout?"

20:39:53 You say, "Oh, Nathaniel is organizing so it'll probably be in his wing."

20:39:58 Lily Kaise says, "Ugh."

20:40:05 Lily Kaise says, "I'll pass. Sorry."

20:40:09 You say, "Ok."

20:40:17 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

20:41:08 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok let's try that again. I'd be up to do a nest, but all I have is a tier 1 fringe suit."

20:41:24 You say, "Well, looks like he can't get another person anyways, so maybe we should just do a beacon just the two of us."

20:41:36 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "One for beacon, three for nest."

20:41:44 Lily Kaise says, "I don't want to gun right now. That's my problem and would have to gun in the Wing."

20:41:49 Lily Kaise grins at you.

20:41:55 You nod and grin at Lily Kaise.

20:42:00 Lily Kaise says, "Sorry Love."

20:42:08 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Can do a beacon. Too, where to?"

20:42:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

20:42:21 You smile at Lily Kaise. "It's ok."

20:42:26 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Earth."

20:42:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh thre you go. Maybe Nathaniel will fly."

20:42:38 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "On my way."

20:42:38 You say, "Yeah, he will."

20:42:44 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Shuel?"

20:42:51 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

20:42:54 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

20:42:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Have fun!"

20:42:57 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

20:43:03 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

20:43:04 You say to Lily, "Love you."

20:43:08 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

20:43:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Love you too!"

20:43:13 You beam at Lily Kaise.

20:43:15 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

20:43:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Roid Seeker". The organization has earned 727,283.15 credits.

20:43:17 Lily Kaise beams at you.

20:43:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

20:43:25 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:43:26 You exit the ship.

20:43:26 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

20:43:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:43:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:43:32 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:43:33 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

20:43:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:43:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:43:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:43:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:43:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:43:42 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "On my way."

20:43:50 The ship is already moving.

20:43:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:43:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:43:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:43:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

20:43:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:43:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:43:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:43:59 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:44:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

20:44:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:44:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:44:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:44:04 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:44:06 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

20:44:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

20:44:07 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

20:44:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:44:10 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

20:44:15 The computer reports that the two-person tugboat "Grab" has jumped out of the sector.

20:44:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:44:24 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:44:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:44:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:44:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:44:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:44:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:44:41 You scramble to your feet.

20:44:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:44:41 You exit the ship.

20:44:57 Nathaniel Owens takes you into his group.

20:45:03 Nathaniel Owens asks, "All set?"

20:45:06 Morris Corlew's group lopes out.

20:45:06 Raiatea the arachnoid security robot skitters after Johann Schraft.
You nod.

20:45:11 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:45:17 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

20:45:25 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the four-person mule "Playin' Possum" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

20:45:29 You follow Nathaniel Owens out.

20:48:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:48:23 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh god... the imagery."

20:48:26 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:48:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:48:46 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Imagination is only the beginning."

20:49:12 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If you ever talk about mating with outsiders again I will serious throw up all over this ship. And you'll be explaining that one to johann."

20:49:18 Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "High out."

20:49:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:49:33 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Who said anything about mating with outsiders, they fall into the blow them up category."

20:50:58 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Well, according to Melinda. Beacons and missions aren't supposed to be fun. So, no, we're not supposed to enjoy blowing their ships up."

20:51:06 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Explosions are fun. Accept when they're you. Then, they're shitty."

20:51:11 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right. Well we just won't tell malinda about it."

20:51:18 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Laugh."

21:30:49 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

21:31:06 [Starship "Libertarians Wing Alpha"; Control Room]

21:31:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a black leather captain's chair here.
Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens and Lexie Amarras are standing here.
You can go southeast, south, southwest, and out.

21:31:10 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

21:31:14 Lexie Amarras

21:31:14 She appears to be 34 years old. She is about five feet and four inches tall and has freckled skin. Her body is slightly pudgy with wide hips and strong calves. She has broad shoulders and somewhat large breasts. Her face is round, many-freckled, and unexceptional, with a large nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are full and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of bushy eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and beady. Her ear-length, slightly curly hair is flame red and unkempt. She has short rosy fingernails. She has a small mole on her upper lip.
 She is wearing a black shipsuit, a black utility belt, and a pair of bright cherry red canvas sneakers. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a small cloth sack, a forest green flat einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a metachannel FTL communicator and watch. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

21:31:18 You wave to Lexie Amarras.

21:31:21 Lexie Amarras nods.

21:31:22 You say to Lexie, "Hi."

21:31:32 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

21:31:33 Lexie Amarras says, "Hi, I'm here. Start the parade."

21:31:39 You grin.

Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens asks, "More things?"

21:31:55 Lexie Amarras says, "So what's the plan gentlemen."

21:31:57 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

21:32:01 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens exclaims, "Pue pue!"

21:32:03 The damage control computer reports, "Repair of the wormhole drive has been completed by the spaceport."

21:32:04 The damage control computer reports, "All spaceport repairs have been completed."

21:32:05 You say, "Sure."

21:32:08 Lexie Amarras says, "I'm up for one more. That'll be my last beacon for this conquest period though."

21:32:11 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:32:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Libertarians Wing Alpha, you are given undock clearance under the Fringe-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:32:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:32:18 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens says, "We'll save that for the fighter thing, then."

21:32:25 Lexie Amarras nods.

21:32:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:32:28 You grin.

21:32:38 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:32:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:32:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

21:32:42 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:32:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:32:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:32:45 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:32:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

21:32:47 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:32:47 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

21:32:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:32:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:32:50 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:32:53 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello, Libertarians Wing Alpha! Welcome to League space! Make yourself at home!"

21:33:00 Lexie Amarras says, "Good I get to go introduce myself to the boredom of scooping."

21:33:02 Lexie Amarras grins.

21:33:03 The computer reports that the one-person star taxi "Impulse" has launched from Old Earth.

21:33:05 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens says into the PA microphone, "Thanks for joining in with nathaniel owens on this make outsiders go boon joy ride."

21:33:09 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:33:09 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens struggles to see around Shule Elemmire as he works with a nearby control panel.
(10 seconds roundtime.)

21:33:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

21:33:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:33:16 Lexie Amarras applauds at Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens.

21:33:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:33:18 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:33:22 Lexie Amarras says, "Was fun. Thanks."

21:33:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Welcome, Libertarians Wing Alpha. Your allies the League welcome you to this spaceport."

21:33:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:33:29 Nathaniel says to Lexie, "If you want we can do that thing now while i'm awake."

21:33:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:33:33 Space Defense Captain Nathaniel Owens pulls a large lever towards him.

21:33:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:33:38 You wave.

21:33:38 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:20:29 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:20:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:21:11 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:21:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:21:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:21:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

23:21:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:21:24 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Ace Of Spades" has jumped out of the sector.

23:21:28 The ship is already moving.

23:21:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:21:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:21:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:21:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:21:31 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

23:21:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:21:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:21:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:21:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:21:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:21:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:21:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:21:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:21:42 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:21:43 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:21:43 --

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

23:21:44 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

23:21:44 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

23:21:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:22:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:22:12 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:22:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:22:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:22:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:22:31 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:22:31 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:22:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:22:32 You scramble to your feet.

23:22:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:22:33 You exit the ship.

23:22:33 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The one-person cargo hauler "The Gimbled Ghost", the three-person clipper "Firestorm", and the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:22:33 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

23:22:33 You can go up.

23:22:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

23:22:35 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:22:36 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:22:36 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair with Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

23:22:38 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:22:39 Lily Kaise smiles.

23:22:40 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:22:45 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

23:22:54 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

23:22:54 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hey glad you're all right!"

23:22:58 Lily Kaise grins.

23:23:03 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:23:07 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:23:12 You grin at Lily Kaise. "I'm fine. Just dozed a bit in my ship."

23:23:19 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

23:23:19 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

23:23:38 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

23:23:43 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

23:24:16 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

23:24:46 Lily gently rubs your back.

23:25:32 Lily Kaise says, "I put the Asteroid processing station together so on Wednesday morning, we'd just have to get it out to 285 and deploy it."

23:25:44 You say, "Ok, cool."

23:25:45 You grin.

23:26:10 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I like to when I can as this way if pressed for time, then it doesn't turn into a longer process than needed."

23:26:15 You nod.

23:26:32 Lily Kaise asks, "How did the beacon or beacons go?"

23:26:39 You say, "It went well."

23:26:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Cool!"

23:27:28 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I went and bought 8 decoys while I was on accord. I don't want to stash more than enough for a conquest but I will try not to run out of them until we know where things are going."

23:27:34 You nod.

23:28:18 You say, "I should grab some more too."

23:28:23 Lily Kaise nods.

23:29:05 Lily Kaise says, "As I say I don't recommend hoarding them but just try to keep enough for a conquest period. I did buy an extra launcher. I'll probably put it in the org conference room."

23:29:12 You grin.

23:29:14 Lily Kaise grins.

23:29:15 You nod.

23:29:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. Energy is pretty much a necessity with this ain't it?"

23:29:32 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yes."

23:29:35 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Very much so."

23:29:44 Lily Kaise says, "Wow morris."

23:29:54 You laugh.

23:29:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Dangit I need a greater energy minimod. I got a greater nanite boost."

23:30:03 Lily Kaise asks, "He obviously doesn't know the purpose of energy?"

23:30:06 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:30:07 You laugh.

23:30:11 You say, "So much he doesn't know."

23:30:43 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I hope I have nanites on my rats suits. I haven't looked at them in ages."

23:30:54 You say, "I want a RATS suit."

23:31:00 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Now I'm curious! Be right back!"

23:31:17 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I wish I knew the current strategy with Mother nests."

23:31:23 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:31:27 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

23:31:29 Lily Kaise glides out.

23:31:31 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:31:31 I don't see "lily" here.

23:33:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Woo I forgot about this module. It's a greater nanite boost."

23:34:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oops wish sorry plasma boost and nanite resistance."

23:35:07 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.
