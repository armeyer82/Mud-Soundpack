Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep

Akemi says to Simon, "Before we hit 10% is what I like."
"We could go for 2%," Melinda says.
Melinda chuckles.
Michael says, "Uh, no."
"Remember," says Akemi, "this ship has a lot of charge capacity."
Melinda asks, "Why not?"
It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.
"Keeping it-," says Akemi.
Akemi says, "Ow."
Michael says, "Ouch."
Akemi rubs her eye.
wince
You wince.
Michael rubs his head.
"My opinion is that once we hit 35 or 30 percent charge," says Kim, "the next
useful place we can find debris might be a point worth charging."
Lily nods.
Michael nods.
Melinda says, "Well."
"We can charge anytime and then just fill up at the next spot after," Melinda
says.
Akemi says, "Ten percent charge is where the ship computer decides there's
probably an emergency and unlocks the escape pod controls."
"That's why I like to keep it above that," Akemi says.
Melinda nods.
Michael nods.
nod
You nod.
Kim says, "Agreed."
Melinda says, "We are a bunch of nodders."
Michael laughs.
Lillian nods.
Lillian Hudson finishes off a day old warm blueberry muffin.
chuckle
You chuckle.
"But," says Akemi, "on this ship ten percent is still over seven hours of
charge."
Lily Kaise takes a bite of a day old  chocolate chip scone.
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.
Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.
"And besides that," says Akemi, "we've got enough debris aboard to recharge
about a third of our charge capacity."
Melinda asks, "A third?"
"Well," says Akemi, "it depends on how fast you burn the fuel."
Melinda nods.
Lillian says to Akemi, "Did you math that out? I've never checked to see how
much a single shovelfull of debris increases charge."
Lily blinks.
Akemi says to Lillian, "I wouldn't measure it per shovel."
Lily asks, "A shovelfull?"
Melinda says to Lillian, "The faster you run the furnace, the more debris it
burns."
Lily nods.
Lillian nods to Melinda.
Melinda says, "I think."
"I think a chamber full yields about 20 percent of charge," Lily says.
"Well," says Kim, "we have traveled over 13 ltc over a time of 2 cycles and then
some without spotting anything."
The curtains close, to no applause.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
"The furnace is less fuel efficient the faster it burns," Akemi says. "The
cladding inside the blast chamber will hold up for the same amount of power
produced though, so burning faster or slower doesn't hurt the wear levels any
more or less."
Lily says, "And of course that varies depending on the maximum available charge
of the ship."
Kim says, "Woo, a train, that's better."
Simon asks, "So why would you even turn the furnis up higher than the lowest
setting if it was less fuel efficient then?"
grin kim
You grin at Kim.
Melinda says, "For speed."
Melinda snaps her fingers. "Everything is about speed."
Lillian says, "We get impatient."
Michael grins.
Kim says, "Definitely glad we're not standing in the spotlights anymore."
Akemi says to Simon, "If you're somewhere there's lots of fuel, and you have
lots of hands available to keep the furnance loaded, it's fine to burn fast."
Lily says to Simon, "If you'r impatient and don't care!"
Lily laughs.
Simon chuckles.
Michael snickers.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in OOC/Messages To The Staff.
Akemi says, "It's worth noting that you can't run the furnance while you're
under way."
Lily nods.
Akemi says, "You have to be completely stopped."
Michael nods.
Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy
application and peers at the screen.
Akemi says, "If you're somewhere dangerous, speed is probably better."
Michael grins.
Michael Winters navigates his silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy

"Yeah," says Kim, "the moment someone moves the ship the thing shuts down."
Akemi Bando navigates her metallic gray touch einrophone to a text-heavy

Subject: Delays in Profile Review
Author: TylerK
Posted: Fri Jun  3 16:28:00 2016 UTC
--
I would just like to express my frustration at the seemingly long delay I'm
experiencing in getting my second iteration of my profile reviewed. I submitted
it last Saturday night, and it's now Friday and it has yet to be reviewed. While
I recognize and fully understand that the staff has lives outside of the game, I
still feel that this is extremely frustrating. It's making it hard for me to let
my character progress because he's running against his point caps, and sooner or
later he will hit all of them. Also, my character is expressing his frustration
with the government for not yet lifting his probationary status, as he feels
he's proven himself more than worthy of becoming a full pilot in the corps with
all of the restrictions of cadethood lifted. Alright, mini-rant over now.

To be honest here a quick support ticket to the hosts may have been a better
option here. Being frustrated I get, but being rude more often than not does not
help people want to help you.

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

"I wasn't awake while you were space imaging that prestelar object," Simon says
in an English accent. "Can I take the photo out and see what it was?"
"Michael has a copy," says Melinda. "Have a look at his. We don't want the
photos getting lost. Of course Akemi can disagree and give it to you if she
wishes."

Simon asks, "What's an oort?"
"It's a commet cloud," says Melinda.
"It was named after some guy who sorta found out about them hundreds of years
ago," Melinda says.
"Couldn't we space image that?" Simon asks. "Or won't that be worth the
distance?"
Melinda says, "The Opik means it has roids too."
"At least I think that's how it works," Melinda says. "And, no, those don't pay
much."
"If we needed to stop anyway to recharge, it'd be worth it," Akemi says. "But
we're still in good shape."
Akemi Bando glances down at her black wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.
"Opik-Oort clouds usually don't have many surprises," Akemi says. "They're often
dark or very dim, all ice and small loose rock, and in general lonely places."

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark

You press a silver button on the front of a large red popcorn popper with chrome
accents, and several dozen unpopped corn kernels fall into the machine's
microwave popping bin. The microwave switches on, and the kernels begin popping.
A blower activates, sweeping the popped popcorn up and around the bin where
waving nozzles spray them thoroughly with the desired flavorings, incidentally
leaving quite a mess on the walls of the popping bin, but as the finished
popcorn is sucked into a small red and white paper bag that has sprung up from
the bowels of the machine, a mechanical arm tipped with a squeegee emerges and
cleans the walls of the bin, afterwards grabbing the bag, thrusting it into your
waiting hand, and disappearing whence it came. For a brief moment the jubilant
cacophony of a choir of singing elves can be heard in the distance; then the
sound fades away, and the machine shuts down with a quiet wheeze.

The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small blue insulated cooler, a small black cooler, a
bottle of peach schnapps, a bottle of expensive cognac, Peaches the little white
CatBot, a clear plastic food storage container, and a cream plastic box labeled

A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing
beneath the ocean waves.
Morris Corlew begins leaning against a wall.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
Morris Corlew meanders southeast.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
Morris Corlew meanders in from the southeast.

For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
Webbing all around suddenly breaks, and the ship swings wildly through space.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
"Nuts," says Akemi.
Morris looks up.
"Oh," says Akemi, "and I forgot to get a storm detector."
"Well," says Akemi, "it's either a strange storm or an energetic one."
Morris asks, "Can it cause any problems other than course changes?"
"It'll beat the riftsail nodes up," Akemi says. "We'll need to do repairs much
sooner."
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
Morris nods.
"Whenever we get hit by one of those energy discharges, check the NDB locator,"
Akemi says.
Lily says, "Oh yeah."

You are receiving no signal from the NDB at Earthgate.
You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem quite strong. The signal strength meter reads: 56%.
"Oh right I see they are really useful," Lily says. "I've been able to avoid
some storms with mine."
Lily says, "We definitely made great use of one when we took Nissi's Imperator
out."
"Storm's really pushing us," says Akemi.
Akemi says to Morris in a Japanese accent, "Storms also cut down effective
sensor range. I think the engineering status boards will even tell you by how
much."
Lily says, "Yeah they do."
Lily says, "Similar to a capsule as when you're accelerating so much faster, it
dampens the sensors."
Lily says, "Be right back."
Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
Lily Kaise glides southeast.
Akemi asks, "I wonder if dropping trim increases sensor range in a storm?"
Akemi Bando scrambles to her feet.

Akemi Bando moves in from the southeast.
Akemi Bando turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the
riftsail to 50%.
The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.
Akemi Bando moves southeast.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Akemi Bando moves in from the southeast.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
Akemi Bando turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the
riftsail to 100%.
Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.
Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah it isn't."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Seems rift trim has no effect on the
storm's sensor dampening."
Blake asks, "Nah, why would it?"
"Just cause you trim it back," says Blake, "it's not going to affect the storm."
"No, but unless it was just weird timing, we seemed to speed up," Morris says.
"It was either the trim change or the energy discharge that happened about the
same time."
Akemi says, "That was just coincidence."
Lily Kaise glides in from the southeast.
Morris nods.
Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
Lily Kaise whistles.
Morris asks, "Any idea what's the fastest recorded travel in the rift?"
Lily laughs.
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
Lily says, "Hmm I don't see any difference in the nDB."
"Yeah, likely an energetic storm," Akemi says.
Lily nods.
Akemi says to Morris in a Japanese accent, "About your fastest travel question,
do you count rift accelerators?"
Morris says to Akemi, "Well...sure, why not?"
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily

Blake says in a Candelarian accent, "What's with the status lights."
Akemi says to Morris in a Japanese accent, "Ten times as fast as we're going
now."

Akemi says to Morris in a Japanese accent, "That's the fastest I've gone in a
capsule with rift accelerator help."
"Wow!" exclaims Morris.
Lily says to Blake, "We'rein an energetic riftstorm and it charges us with those
energy bursts which will eventually cause the rift drive to break down most
likely."
Blake nods.
Lily says, "We experienced one either going to or coming back from Hall of pain
and we had to stop twice to repair."

You nod to Lily.
Morris says, "Maybe that's why it's called Hall of Pain."
Lily says, "No the energetic riftstorm is the pain in the butt."
Lily says in a New Earth accent, "It was for us at least."
"Heh at least we've gotten out om Known Space," Lily says. "When I didn't

Lily says, "Um out of."
Remember what I said.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Akemi says, "We've been out of Known Space since before the storm."

Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

"Obstacles, or Joy Ride?" asks Akemi.
Lily says, "On the module transporter that Mel has."
"Joy Ride, right," says Akemi.
"I think I avoided one with my platform when Shule and I were out earleir," Lily
says.
Morris yawns and stretches.
Morris Corlew stops sitting with his arms wrapped around his knees.
"Ships designed for exploration hold up better," Akemi says. "I know Metal Heart
can hang in an energetic storm for longer than this."
Lily nods to Akemi.
"I think I'm going to go get some rest," Morris says. "I'll catch everyone
later."
Lily waves to Morris.
The curtains close, to no applause.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Morris waves to Lily.
Akemi says, "Don't get teleported away in your sleep by a strange storm."
"That'd be bad," says Akemi.
Lily says, "Haha."
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
Morris nods. "Yeah..."
Morris Corlew meanders southeast.
Lily says, "Yeah go lock yourself up kid."
Lily laughs.
