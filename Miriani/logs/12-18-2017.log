This area of the station is like no other. Rather than giving off the appearance of being enclosed, holograms are projected throughout the room, giving an appearance of a large open area. Images of birds circle about overhead in an azure sky, while under foot it looks as though the floor is a long pier spanning a deep body of water. Fish jump out of the murky mote occasionally, and every so often an enormous lizard appears. Adding to the illusion, a second pier can barely be seen far off to the west. The only way to cross is a huge boat that travels back and forth, offering transport to the other side. On the north side of the pier, a small terminal is set up to purchase tickets for the Pirate's Last Chance by accessing the MENU. To the east, a city can be spotted, and the sounds of laughter and conversation drift in from that direction.

This large shop has been designed to resemble an ancient tailor's. Stools are strategically placed around the store in front of three-way mirrors, and set next to each is a pair of racks, one with hangers and garment bags, and the other with measuring tapes and cushions holding threaded needles. Salesdroids dressed in period attire wander to and fro, assisting customers and occasionally taking in seams or pointing out which garment is where. Their footsteps, as well as those of the store's patrons are muffled by ornate animal skin rugs. Adding ambiance to the area, a large stone fireplace takes up the majority of the southern wall, and flickering firelight bathes the shop in a warm glow. A huge doorway leads off to the west back to the shopping district, and small curtained off fitting rooms are to the east.
You see a dusky pink marble trash can shaped like a crown, a rustic dark gray wolf skin area rug, a soft cinnamon brown Bear skin area rug, a thick snowy white stag skin area rug, an enormous stone fireplace with a heavy stone hearth and a pinewood mantel, a rustic oak brown wooden chest, and a stack of firewood here.

This spacious shop is painted a shade of shimmering green that resembles the scales of a dragon. The stone floor underfoot is bright red, lending the appearance of a giant tongue. Huge foam stallagmites and stallagtites line the perimeter of the shop, looking like menacing teeth, but rather providing places to lean and observe the goings-on of the shop. Set in neat rows along the floor are waist-high columns with 3-d holographic projections rising from the flattened tops showcasing the various products being sold here. Set in a recessed niche in one corner is what appears to be an enormous reptillian nose, and suspended from the ceiling above it is a scroll advising customers to get their very own Dragon Snot [TM].

A huge stone archway opens up into a relatively cramped shop. Nearly every available inch of floorspace is taken up with racks of costumes in all shapes, sizes and styles. Along the walls are shelves of accessories, and posters above them indicate which piece goes with which costume. Wandering about the shop, dressed in a midnight black set of armor is a nearly three meter tall droid, a menacing-looking lance held in its hands. Order terminals are placed at the end of each aisle, and when asked, the droid advises patrons on what to purchase.

This expansive lawn is lush and well-tended. An environment field keeps the area warm and provides the necessary precipitation to keep the grass and plants alive. Gardeners trundle about, keeping the area manicured and orderly. People mill about, from wandering minstrels to older men pushing vending carts and figures dressed in full combat armor, lending an air of an open market. An enormous fountain takes up most of the available space here, and people occasionally stop to sit on its edge and rest their weary bones. A long metal pole holding a gas-fueled wrought-iron lantern in the shape of a skull is casting a warm black light throughout the room.

The deck of this vessel is comprised of wooden planks. A tall oak rail runs the length of the deck, presumably to prevent anybody from falling overboard. Enormous wooden poles are set up at strategic points, each with a massive mast emblazoned with the Templar coat of arms attached. Atop one pole is a crow's nest with a lookout perched procariously in it with a spy glass held to his eye. At the helm, an experienced-looking captain stands manning the wheel. Set behind him are a number of wooden crates upon which to sit while crossing the mote.

02:23 One of the birds circling overhead tucks its wings against its body and does a spectacular dive toward the water. In a brilliant show of agility, it snatches a fish in its bill and returns to the sky.

02:23 Various crew members begin hauling out anchors and mooring lines from compartments under the deck.

02:23 With a jolt and a bump, the ship stops moving. The crew drops anchors overboard and begins securing the vessel to the pier.

The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible.

Architectural Design Simulators
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Architectural design simulators allow you to build and customize property to add to the game. Through a holographic avatar of yourself, you can configure and customize a blueprint to your liking. All building commands work inside a blueprint, and no charge is incurred for your character in reality.

  Getting Started
Once you have purchased an architectural design simulator, you should BOLT it down and USE it. You will be presented with a number of options, most prominently to create, edit, or delete a blueprint. To get started, choose 'Create Blueprint' and follow the prompts.
First, you will be asked for a name. This name should be indicative of what you wish your completed area to be called. It cannot have punctuation save for hyphens, and it will appear before each room name when you are in the area itself. Once you have decided on a name, you will arrive in a menu of choices for which real estate you wish to simulate. If you are building this property for yourself, pick what type of structure it should be upon finalization. If you are building this area for eventual inclusion in the game's global geographics, choose house. Be sure that you have spoken with a host prior to building an area for general inclusion, as you will need permission to add a public area to a pre-built planet.  Public areas should be thematically appropriate and not offer exclusive benefits to the person creating it. If your simulator is bolted in a private structure that you are an owner of, you will also be presented with the option to import it in as a new design. This may be useful for experimenting with possible new additions to your current structure. Submissions of imported designs will not, however, usually be accepted. If you wish to update your current design, you need to build it by hand.
Finally, you will be asked if you want to password protect this blueprint. If other people have access to the simulator and you do not want them modifying the design, choose yes and enter a password. Passwords are encrypted one-way, so if you forget your password, it cannot be read or recovered by a host. Keep this in mind when adding a password.

  Building
Once you have finished configuring your blueprint, you will be connected to a holographic avatar. Your avatar is naked, and thus lacks a communicator, message board reader or other gadgets. You can use the NEWBIE channel or the DESIGN channel. The design channel is IC and allows you to speak to any other avatars that may be connected to the blueprint. It should not be used to circumvent communicators.
Most building commands work inside of a blueprint. For more detail on these, review HELP BUILDING COMMANDS. You cannot create or submit stores inside of a blueprint, nor can you access authorization lists or use security center functions. Similarly, holographic avatars can move through any biometrically locked exit without requiring authorization. There are some commands that are exclusive to building avatars, which are listed below.

DESIGN <text | who> - Speak on the design channel. This channel employs minimal filtration and is for conversing about your design with other avatars that may be connected. It should remain in character. Providing the [who] argument will show other avatars that are connected to your design.
@DESCRIBE/DESCRIBE <object | here> as <text> - Describe <object>. Using "here" as the object will describe the room you are standing in. If you wish to have a multi-line description, use the syntax DESCRIBE <object> by itself instead.
CREATE <name> - Create a custom item. Custom items can be props, containers or furniture and there is a limit; 5 for a house, 10 for a space station, 15 for a moon and 20 for a planet. Each item will add 5,000,000 credits to the final cost of the blueprint.
DESTROY <item> - Destroy an item. This is not reversible.
DIG-GO <exit name> to <room> - Digs a go exit with the provided name. If you don't provide a name, the room name will default to "New Room".
DEMOLISH-GO <go exit> - Demolishes a go exit. The other side must not have any connecting rooms.
ENVIRONMENT (or ENV) - Alter the environment of a room.
EXIT-MESSAGES (or EXITMSG) <exit> - Set messages that are shown when moving 
13:46 through an exit. Pronouns and other substitutions can be used here.
PRONOUNS - Show a list of pronouns that can be used in various messages.
LIGHTING (or LIGHTS) - Turn lighting on or off in a room. Rooms that are not lit will not show descriptions or contents.
DOORTYPE - Change the door type for an entrance accessible with the ENTER-command. You must be standing in the room with the entrance.
ROOMFIX (or DEMOLISH HERE) - Remove a room that has no exits, go exits, or enter exits and move your avatar back to the first room of the blueprint.
ROOMS - View all rooms in your blueprint.
WORTH - View a cost breakdown for the entire blueprint. This is how much you will need to pay once you wish to make this design a reality.
ZAP (or TELEPORT) <room name> - Instantly transport your avatar to <room name>.
ADDNOTE <text> - Add notes for a specific room. Notes can be deleted or reviewed through the manage notes function when modifying your blueprint. You should leave a note in the room that you wish to set as a docking bay or landing pad if you are making anything other than a house.
END - Terminates the simulation.

  Further Customization
The second option in the initial menu allows one to edit blueprint parameters. If your blueprint is password protected, you will need the password to access and change settings.

Change Parent - Change the type of structure that governs your design.
Enable/Disable Map - Toggle specific mapping on your blueprint. This defines whether people can type MAP [room] to receive directions to a specific room.
Rename - Change the name of a blueprint.
Add/Change Password - Change an existing password. If you have not set a password, this option will guide you through adding one. If you wish to clear the password, type the old password and then leave the new password field blank.
Manage Notes - Add or delete attached notes. Notes should detail special accommodations for your structure such as lifts and should also include where you wish to place it in the real game world.
Set Sector Coordinates - Set coordinates for a private station, moon, or planet. These will be the coordinates that your new structure occupies in the sector once it has been physically built.

  Submitting Blueprints
Once you have finished your blueprint, you should submit it. Keep in mind that you cannot submit a design if you lack the points to own it. Submission can be done through the simulator menu and puts your design in a queue for hosts to review. While your blueprint is in the queue you will not be able to access or modify it. Once it has been approved, a host will approach you to take payment and implement your design into the world. Be sure to include painful amounts of detail in the notes attached, lest it not be done exactly how you intended.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet

14:03 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Mekensie" reports current location pinpointed aboard the one-person expediter "Dolphin" at Alliance High Guard Command.

14:03 Mekensie the droid
This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is wearing a blue cotton flower-print sundress.  She is wearing a pair of black leather high heels with streaks of silver in them on her feet. She is also wearing a green keychain with "The WildHorse Saloon" printed on it.
She is carrying a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen in her left hand and a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the s
14:03 ides in her right hand.

14:03 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:03 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

If you find this an absolutely terrifying prospect (as you should), drop by Styx in the MUD on Pax until you feel like braving the festivities once again. Out of comms? Type HALLOWEEN to temporarily teleport yourself back in communications range for the fun and horror. Once you're sick of it, typing the command again will move you back. Finally, until the day is over, out of character communication is permitted on communicators. Happy Halloween!

[11/25/17 - 3:18 p.m.] Announcement: Christmas time is upon us once again. Santa is flying, the elves are sober and ready to make presents for all the good girls and boys. Have a look at message board post 88727 for all the details.
[11/26/17 - 10:00 a.m.] Announcement: A couple more rules regarding Christmas gift requests have been posted. Please see message board post 88748 for details. TLDR? Spell and grammar check your stuff man or it gets rejected.
[11/30/17 - 1:17 a.m.] Announcement: Due to recent events, I would like to take this opportunity to remind people about the mutual respect help file. Please read it when you have a moment and keep it in mind. Thank you.

You've got until the 18th at 11:59 PM GST for your request to be sent in. We would also like to remind everyone to use the tradesman labs on Empanda Station where possible. You may wish to read message board posts 88727 and 88748. Thanks again and happy holidays!
[12/08/17 - 8:24 p.m.] Announcement: Time for a reminder. Please, for the love of toast, when aboard a starship, please type PA-CHECK before taking it upon yourself to go out of character on the PA. Be considerate of other players. If they wish to remain in character, please respect their right to do so. OOC warnings will be handed out for violations. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
[12/15/17 - 12:16 p.m.] Announcement: This is a reminder that you have about two and a half days (check local listings) to submit a gift request to Santa if you haven't done already. If your gift req

Mutual Respect
--------------------------------------------------
There have always been certain issues in Miriani that the policies haven't specifically addressed and that is what this is going to attempt to cover.  

Miriani is an online world designed completely by volunteers.  Let me say that again in a different way.  None of the hosts are paid.  All of the hosts that have ever worked on Miriani have done so out of a desire to make it a better place to be for the players.  They've wanted to see it grow and they've wanted to see it improve and become something better as a result of their contributions.  From personal experience, I can tell you that normally the most a Host receives as compensation is a player accusing them of cheating or otherwise committing actions that go against the betterment of the game as a whole.  Now, normally speaking that'd be pretty easy to shrug off, but combined with the fact that we are volunteers it can make it quite difficult, annoying, and frankly hurtful when we hear about it, especially because we know it's not true.

Recently, the effects of the latest rumor had been seen in Albori feeling like he had no recourse but to walk about from the game he, more or less, built from the ground up.  I'd like that to serve as evidence that actions our players take can have very real, hurtful effects on us.  We are people just like you and we want to see Miriani succeed.  We want you to understand that any cheating on our part would sabotage what we work every day in an attempt to build up.  We would, very much so, be shooting ourselves in the foot.  

From the host perspective, sometimes the rumors and hurtful things we hear coming from the players we attempt to build this world for, can cause us to become jaded and being jaded is the first step in creating a "them versus us" atmosphere and that isn't what we want by any means.  Online games have literally gone from thriving entities, to ghost towns, because of the "them versus us" mentality.

All that said, I was a player in many MOOs and MUDs, and other online games, long before I was a host in Miriani so I can completely understand the play perspective on things sometimes.  I understand that sometimes your perception is that you have been cheated.  I respect the fact that you, as players, put your valuable time and lots of heart into playing this game.  I can respect it because I do it as well, so I know what it's like.   I know the other hosts respect it as well, because we are all equally frustrated and hurt when players feel we are cheating them. 

Without further ado I'll get to the real meat and potatoes and that is the following: The hosts of Miriani do not cheat to screw over our players.  We do not cheat to help our own player characters.  We do not cause random lag to players we "don't like."  We do not ban players because we don't like them 
14:21 or because we just "feel like it."  We don't give special attention to people who donate lots of money.  I suspect I speak for the other hosts as well when I say, that you have our personal guarantee this is the truth of the matter. 

With that pledge, we are going to also ask this of the players.  The rumors and conspiracy theories about hosts need to stop.  They do damage to us on a very personal level because of the effort we put into Miriani and quite frankly, are completely disrespectful.   So, as of this message that stuff needs to stop.  We don't want to see or hear about people talking to each other claiming that we gave them random lag, or that our player characters used host powers to destroy their ship, or any of the other hurtful things that are said.  So, that's the deal.  We pledge to continue working hard to make Miriani a better place for you to play, and in return we ask you pledge to stop this type of destructive and hurtful behavior.
Thank you for reading this message and I politely ask you to let it sink it and remember it.  If you forget it, or would like to reread it at some point, it will be made available as a help file.

What we failed to mention in our original post are the following two things:

* When submitting gift requests, please, please, please spell check your item. Similarly, grammar check it as well. This means don't use IT'S when you mean ITS. ITS is the possessive form of the word, meaning that the property belongs to the item. IT'S is what you want to use when you're trying to say IT IS. Same rule for WHOSE versus WHO'S. WHOSE is it belongs to who, where WHO'S means WHO IS.
* Don't capitalize item names unless they begin with a proper noun. This isn't as much of a big deal when submitting a normal letter, as we have to hand-make the item already. However, it makes it a big pain in the ornaments when it's done in the labs. We have a lot of requests to fill, so do your part and make it a little easier on us.

Failure to comply with the rules will result in the immediate rejection of your request and you will need to fix any issues and resubmit.

The holidays are almost upon us! It's time to request your Christmas gifts once again. If you're not into snowflakes and cheer, feel free to type SCROOGE
to opt out of all christmas happenings, including getting a present from Santa. You will not be able to opt back in, so be sure you are sure about your
scrooginess before confirming the command. As the excitement of the gift-giving season approaches, we elves ask that you follow a few simple rules when
requesting your gifts from santa this year.

* Santa won't make violent weapons, droids, or anything that requires points to get normally.
* Be very detailed. Provide painful amounts of detail. If we have to fill in the blanks and you don't like what we did, you won't be able to change it.
* Once an item is complete, it cannot be added to unless you use a tradesman item.
* Food dispensing things are limited to 20 items.
* Items cannot stun or otherwise incapacitate another player. See rule number one.
* Santa may also refuse any request for any reason. This can be a balance reason, a work reason, a conflict of interest, or anything else. If your item
is refused, you will receive a letter in the mail.
* No item renames/redescriptions/additions will be accepted this year. Everything must be an original item so that it can be wrapped and/or delivered at
a holiday shindig. this means no requesting verbs for your already existing pet giraffe. The item must be able to be crammed--I mean carefully placed in
a box and wrapped.
* Assists regarding adding things to your items, asking when your item will be done, or requesting another item will be force cancelled. Santa is very
busy! If you repeatedly assist about your item, you might risk losing it entirely.
* Please only send letters. Do not send packages to Santa! He's never been the same since the flaming proboscis monkey feces incident of 2353.
* Santa is all into spreading cheer, but not in "that" way. He won't be making babies for anybody anymore! Not since that messy lawsuit...
* Likewise, Santa's tired of mucking stalls. He's not dealing in animals this year. No sir. What kind of jerk would cram a helpless kitten or horse into
a box anyway? Beside Coal the Elf that is.
* We also ask that where possible, please use a tradesman item lab to submit your request. This includes for vanities, food robots and forcefield spacesuits.
For those of you intrepid adventurers braving the mind numbing boredom of uncharted space outside communications range or known space in general, fear not. There is more than enough
Christmas cheer to go around. You simply must locate a star in the sector and then make a WISH! (Type WISH.) Santa will hear you loud and clear!

If you're in local space, Santa prefers more conventional letters.

1.) Locate a mail center. Typically these can be found on capital planets by typing MAP MAIL.
2.) Purchase a letter. (Type MENU to find letter and BUY #. It should be number five, so BUY 5.)
3.) Type WRITE LETTER.
4.) Write your request down, giving as much detail as possible.
5.) Type a single period on a line by itself.
6.) Type SEND LETTER.
7.) Type Santa Claus (that's Claus with no e.)

All letters must be received by Santa by December 20th. No new letters will be accepted after this date. Tears will not sway us. We're elves, not pixies.
If you've had a letter rejected on or after the 20th, you have until the 23rd to express mail it to Santa. No letters at all will be accepted after December
23rd. As a final note, have mercy on us elves. there are a lot of pilots to make gifts for. While we realize this may be one of the only chances some of
you have to request an item, now is not the time to request the most complicated thing you can possibly think of. Bear in mind that we have more than 90
requests to fill every year, and that takes up a lot of time here at the cheerful holiday workshop.

Get those letters in, and have a happy holiday season!

Rather than appearing to be a workshop, this large area resembles an upscale salon. Patrons work at various stations, designing hair and nails. The overwhelming stench of chemicals permiates the area, making it hazardous to breathe, and the air purification system does little to quell the stench. Order terminals are spaced out against one wall, and instructions are posted next to each.

Honey brown hardwood floors meet walls that are painted a brilliant shade of cranberry red. Immaculately dressed bank tellers sit behind glass paneled desks smiling cheerfully at their clientele. Leading up to each of the employee stations are thick red velvet ropes that have been placed to keep organization in the small room. Leafy dark green plants have been placed around the space as decorations, and paintings of exotic landscapes adorn the walls. Attached to the door is a small golden bell which sends a soft melodious chime throughout the room each time a person enters or exits the center.

14:40 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Public Garage.

14:41 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.
You can go south and out.

15:00 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, and Estelle the droid here.
You can go south and out.

The ship is designed as a repair vessel and is capable of replacing destroyed components of other ships in space, thus foregoing the typical dry docking process.  With a hull strength roughly compareable to a Voyager, the Ameliorator is not designed to be in combat.  A long charge time enables it to travel long distances to meet with ships for repairs.  The vessel has a moderately sized cargo space, to carry repair parts.  It has seven laser turrets and no bardenium cannons.  Finally, it has a docking bay.  The Ameliorator requires 3500 general and 350 combat points to purchase."

15:10 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Mekensie the droid, Estelle the droid, and a holographic representation of the ship's computer here.

You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:55 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the five-person transverser "Star Liner" and the three-person heliogaster "Galactic Rainbow" landed here.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

18:24 You peer out and see...

18:24 [Empanda Station; Public Garage]
Large robotic arms are constantly in motion transporting starships to and from the overhead docking bay in this cavernous starship garage. The echo from the launching and landing of ships reverberates off the concrete walls, creating a cacophony of sound when combined with the mechanical whirl of the busy sanitation drones that dart among the powered down starships. Blue and white lines have been painted onto the stone floor, serving as markings to keep the ships in some semblance of organization. Every so often, one of the large metallic arms will pick up a starship and transfer it to another area of the garage to optimize the available space.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go south and up.

18:24 I don't understand that.

You can go south and out.

18:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

18:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

18:24 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

18:25 #$#soundpack_pong

18:25 #$#soundpack_lag 108

18:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:25 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:25 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:25 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:25 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:25 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

18:25 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:25 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

18:25 (Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Business Office) (Sun Deck) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has entered the sector.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:25 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

18:25 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

18:25 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:25 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:25 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:25 (Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Business Office) (Sun Deck) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

18:25 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

18:25 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

18:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.
(Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Business Office) (Docking Bay) You notice a bright flash of light in the distance; a starship must be coming in to dock.

18:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:25 (Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Business Office) (Sun Deck) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
