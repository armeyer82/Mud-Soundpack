-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a red plastic food storage container,
a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated
blue cooler, a small white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, and an
insulated pink cooler here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
[0m[Miriani] [Short-range Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Yup."[0m
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties and a pair of white
leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in
a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring
inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly
labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, both
thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.

finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a compact red refrigerator, a small
white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, an insulated pink cooler,
and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on Shule Elemmire's lap.
You can go south and out.

Ishtarr Tiara and Guindalen Jones, I wish you both a warm welcome and a
successful career as pilots ahead. Next, I have the state of the corps report as
of Friday May 5th for you, which goes as follows. 17 days into the current term,
the AEU had completed 10 out of 113 total completed decoy beacon drops (8.85%).
The AEU is responsible for 0 out of 10 total destroyed rats nests (0.0%), and
finally the AEU is responsible for 0 out of 0 total completed salvage
operations. That concludes the state of the corps report. Finally, I will be
headed out of communications range again shortly, but I have set up a
transmitter station 1 sector south from Campeche which will reach us out there
if you have questions, need help or just wanna chat. If any of you cadets want
to join us out there, send us a message and we will see if someone can come pick
you up. Details on the transmitter are on your message boards under
general/exploration, in response to a final op note. This concludes my report
for today, Fly safe everyone! Kim Saunders. [08:51  7 May 2317 GST]
89,564,049.28 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, I would just like to take a moment to
welcome Ryo Stel to the pilot corps. I hope your time here with us as a pilot
will be pleasant and fruitful, and hope to meet you in person soon. Also,
another op station was built at 273, so myself and many others will stil be out
there on and off for the next several days at least. Remember that, if you need
to reach us, a transmitter is available south of Campeche, further details can
be found on your message board under general/exploration in a reply to final op
note. Have a nice day, and fly safe. Kim Saunders. [11:35 10 May 2317 GST]

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark
purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light
purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is muscular and punctuated by a small navel. Her face is oval and
somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy
brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of
dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair
is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long
painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers
hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.

gold dichroic glass, an indigo leather jacket trimmed with steel studs, an
indigo silk cropped top, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven
rows of very long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a pair of silky black
pants, and a pair of black leather boots with medium heels and steel buckles up
the sides. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small
yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a
silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy
obsidian wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely
crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass
framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold
flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird
stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Praying Mantis"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Asteroid Belt Management Station.

Keyonna Bradley
She appears to be 30 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has light brown skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and
firm calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts.
Her face is heart-shaped and quite pretty, with a button nose and dimpled chin.
Her lips are pouty and pinkish red and occasionally part to reveal a set of
white teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and
squinting. Her mid-back length, thick hair is dark honey brown and in a bun. She
has long rosy fingernails. She has a small birthmark on her neck.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a classic misty rose silk sheath, an exquisite gold watch with
sapphire accents, and a pair of rose pink patent leather stilettos. She is also
wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a
small cloth sack, a small matching sequined purse, a flight control scanner, a
metachannel FTL communicator, a shimmering coral pink silk backpack, and a mood
ring. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms,
left wrist, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left
uncovered.

[0m#SESSION 'StarConquest' ACTIVATED.[0m
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."

[Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

ftl accord
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."

[Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
|Us"S|BwPisPT$|`TLuO=/:|_X.w~)B[37.rq]LQ
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a dark gray leather captain's
chair, and a decoy beacon launcher here.

You stand on a large cement platform, held in place by heavy titanium alloy
supports. A milling crowd surrounds you, and you find it nearly impossible to
see anything through all the people around you. Stores and other commercial
structures have been constructed at random intervals across the platform. The
entrance to a shop called 'The Third Entrance' is here, several imposing-looking
bouncer types standing guard outside.
You can go east and west.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four. The hatch appears to be
locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four. The hatch appears to
be locked.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
"i`8;7H'WM3f`<1a/ll(U+D\|u9BIl1_9{0Zg<f~
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, AEU Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2345 light-minutes per second from Galactic West and
Very Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

There are no other ships in the sector.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

Evenia Callseah is in the photo. She is reclining on a sofa, with her legs
teasingly parted. One hand curled around a breast, and a cute little smile on
her face.
She appears to be at Apartment 9001; Living Room.
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average, firm breasts
with large dark brown nipples. Her abdomen is muscular and punctuated by a small
navel. More intimately, she has neatly trimmed jet black pubic hair and a
muscular butt. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and
strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a
set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and
wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble
except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She
has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash
brown leather in her hair. She has a past injury on her throat.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a shiny gold ring pierces her left
nipple, a shiny gold ring pierces her right nipple, a thick gold ring with a
dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm

charm pierces her belly button, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip,
and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You can go north and down.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, Lily Kaise's workbench, and

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 17 April 2317 GST. Time remaining: 13 days,
4 hours, 17 minutes, and 39 seconds

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova"
You see a cruiser here.
"Supernova" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AH-12b" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. The bays of its minicannon
launchers are somewhat scuffed and painted silver. Its landing struts are clean
and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a silver AEU logo forward on the starboard side, a geodesic radome, a
smooth dome, and a single large port covered by an iris-style hatch on the
forward end, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing.

l supernova
the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova"
You see a cruiser here.
"Supernova" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AH-12b" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is gleaming and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. The bays of its
minicannon launchers are oiled to perfection and painted silver. Its landing
struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a silver AEU logo forward on the starboard side, a geodesic radome, a
smooth dome, and a single large port covered by an iris-style hatch on the
forward end, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing.

Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots! I am happy to have
noticed a sharp upswing in decoy beacon drops and missions. I encourage you all
to continue this upward trend. Remember, if anyone needs anything at all related
to space combat or anything else in general, feel free to send a letter to
Ather, or to call the space defense captain's office so we can set up times to
meet. Additionally, with the influx of new pilots, I am contemplating holding
refresher classes for how to deal with IFS, Outsiders, RATS, allied pirates etc.
Let me know when would be a good time for everyone and I'll try to set up the
best possible time. [20:28 15 May 2317 GST]

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Lily Kaise's workbench
here.
You can go south and out.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "As you buy more

[Starship "Vengeance"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You see a large leather chair and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If it's greater than
90%, all the better. If it's less...well, depends on how much less."

Not much to see out there.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There's no guessing

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well that was only
my third site."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't forget to check
from time to time which UPGRADES you might qualify for at any mining station."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can probably

too. I set up my mining site, now I'm just casually letting it run and talking
to whoever."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Wonder how long it
would take to completely clear that place of bari."

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Tamra Swenson, and Constantine Stone are standing here.
You can go out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone
here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Dreamstar", the five-person gunship "Praying
Mantis", the one-person cargo hauler "Pretzel Paluza", and the one-person cargo
hauler "Stubborn Mule" are landed here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

 You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans,
and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of

You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Kim,
Below is a copy of the letter I have just sent off to Sir Wellington concerning
this Allied Pirate issue.
During the course of the salvage op event that many pilots partook in, there was
an understanding. Mutuality pilot Pierre Louis as well as AEU pilot Eli Gray
brought us some information. We were told that the Allied Pirates would steer
clear of the area seeing as Mutuality friends were in the area.
Due to the large number of IFS and Outsiders in the area, Mister Kelsey says
that he had a group out there ready to defend. The incident that I recall is the
following: Myself, Morris Corlew and Nicolette Lawrence were salvaging. Jason
Rat, Bryan Stout, Emily Ford, Damien Goss and Shule Elemmire were aboard the
gunship. I believe it was my gunship, "The Storm Petrel." The issue is that
Mister Kelsey believes a cease fire was broken when the gunship fired upon his
area defenders. I was waiting in the neighboring sector with the op can so have
no idea who fired first or anything of that nature. I do believe that this was
the op in which they had to switch ships to, a pincer called, "The Wolves have
Claws," so that AEU pilot Kim Saunders could be added to the defense. I also
believe that most of the pilots thought the pirates would not be getting
involved in ops but did not realize they wouldn't be causing issues otherwise.
At any rate, I am inquiring as to whether or not we can find out who fired first
on behalf of the Mutuality pilots. I plan to ask the pilots aboard the ship
about this incident as well.
The other incident that I recall was during the early morning hours, I saw a
couple of pirates come into the sector. I did launch my corvette and they
promptly vacated the sector. I did not fire and was not fired upon.

To Whom It May Concern,

Below is my account of what I can recall of the events that transpired on the
evening of May 9, 2317. Just prior to 2300, a group of us pilots, conducted a
salvage operation. On this particular salvage operation, I was part of the
defence team and was aboard the five-person hammerhead "The Storm Petrel". I was
manning weapons room 3. the salvagers had already launched and Melinda Michaels
had moved to the adjacent sector west of the beacon sector, but had not dropped
the salvaging can as of yet.. Damien Goss flew this particular salvage
operation. Soon after launching, Damien called out over the PA that pirates were
present. At the same moment, the ship was put on red status and soon thereafter,
the first ship began to be tracked by the ship's target tracking array. As soon
as the ship went to red status, I scanned the sector to ascertain ship names and
classes. According to the ship's sensors, aside from our salvager's ships, there
were two five-person strike gunboats and two fighters in the sector. Due to the
fact that the ship went to red status, I presumed that we were engaging and
based on the sounds of the ship's weapons, so did the other gunners. Therefore,
we all opened fire as is our training when the ship is put on red status and a
ship is tracked. I have no idea if the pirates locked on our ship first or if we
were the aggressor. If there are any more questions regarding this incident,
please feel free to contact me. I hope this is helpful.

Date - February 2, 2316
From - Lily Kaise, AEU Ground Squad Leader
To - Shule Elemmire, AEU Voice of the Corps
Subject - Request to Petition for a Special Recall of Industrial Whip, Tatiana
Kruppin
Pursuant to the recent events and subsequent contraversy involving Tatiana
Kruppin and the crew of the Metal Heart Expedition along with our recent vote
that Tatiana's report be overruled describing her experiences with the Metal
Heart crew prior to being forced to evacuate the Metal Heart starship via Escape
Pod, this is to request that a special Recall Vote be presented to the AEU Pilot
Corps to remove Tatiana Kruppin's civilian liaison title of Industrial Whip and
related responsibilities. Initially, though, if you would deem it reasonable, I
would suggest that to avoid this complex formality, that Tatiana Kruppin is
given the recommendation that she should voluntarily resign from her position of
Industrial Whip.
Respectfully,
Lily Kaise, AEU Ground Squad Leader

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Your battlesuit is rolling along like there's no rollmorrow.
[Site 131288152; Surface] (inside a battlesuit)
You stand on the surface of Teslaworld. The levels of radiation and magnetic
flux here play havoc with your battlesuit's electronics, obscuring all input in
shifting levels of white noise. The sky is obscured by dark purple clouds, which
flash several times a second with bolts of lightning. Markings on the ground
show that this area has already been explored.
You can go down.

Angela Caesar
She appears to be 20 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is of average build with slightly curved hips and
pleasantly curved calves. She has slender shoulders and average-sized breasts.
Her face is long and girlish, with a wide nose and round chin. Her lips are
faintly downturned and pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white
teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are blue and wide. Her
mid-back length, wavy hair is dark blonde and drawn back in a ponytail. She has
neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a fierce pink and sapphire blue dinosaur mask with scowling eyes
and jagged white teeth, a standard grey shipsuit, and a pair of shiny black
boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable
newsfeed aggregator, a charred metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack,
a plain flat einrophone in a dark gray leather phone holster, an indigo guitar
case, and a black flightbag. Her head, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands
are left uncovered.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.

[Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.
