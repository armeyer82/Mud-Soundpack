Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Not terrible. Heya,
Evangeline, good ta hear ya."
ftl second battle
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a
settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of
beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates
a solar system may also be in this cluster.
sit chair
You sit up onto a gray leather captain's chair.
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Thanks. How are you.. oh
you already answered that."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander chuckles.
A beacon has been placed trailing the orbit of Candelaria, a waypoint on the way
to and from deeper space.
This beacon lies along the path of the local solar system's galactic orbit. Dust
and debris has been pulled in its wake, leaving a funnel-shaped void.
Suddenly your ship is in the midst of a cloud of debris. Clearly these are the
remnants of a great battle, having long since drifted away from where it
originally took place.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-105 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to The Second Battle of Deep Candelaria
Orbit."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Ly_l$P,x6{v*APIFvK@K>5$wLY>Gd6P2\Zqpzbd+
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2864 light-minutes per second from Galactic

Salvage Outsider Wrecks
--
A patrol recently ran into a bunch of Outsider ships near Clarkson's Push.
The fighting's done, but the people in R&D think there might be something to
salvage from the wrecks.
Head out there and pick up 90,000 units from the wrecks and we'll see what we've
got.

A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the
stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector
Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and
darkened, and the ISC is no more.
Via general sector communication, Beacon B-31 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to Clarkson's Push."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
?XMbrtHh?1[MTDK.I@VSu$Ci$0@mJDSo*vP6Z9S*
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2834 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Up."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello AEU."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "It's inside the ITPN pod over there."
You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as
the ship enters normal status.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are
powered down.
Kim Saunders strolls in from below.

Laser Mk II for the four-person mule "Ground Trouble" on behalf of the
organization.
Kim Saunders strolls south.

[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow
with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also
retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary
blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship
supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The five-person strike gunboat "Morning Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

You peer south...
[Starship "Morning Dove"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair and an improved temporary
wormhole drive here.
Lily Kaise and Kim Saunders are standing here.
You can go north and south.
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Hmm. Anything else?"
You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport
repairs the starship.
Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All clear."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Think you've got it."
The starship transitions into another sector.
Kim Saunders strolls in from the south.
Kim Saunders strolls down.

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "No."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I need missions."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I need a battery...and
missions or beacons...probably even just one of either...would work."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "They will happen when they
happen!"
[General Communication] "But I want my battery...now!" Morris Corlew grumbles.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Call for them, people will
maybe, probably go."

[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Morris you will need industry for

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah...Not the battery I'm
wanting...it just has SCP...and I'm 11 away. Plus, my industry is way higher
than last time we talked."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think t he problem is that a
lot of people are preparing to go on an expedition?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's not anything fancy like

[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Starseekers. Who here is actually
going on that?"

for a bit."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, if there is anything I
can do to help with that goal, let me know."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's an industrial one...so
unless you wanna haul roids on a hauler without the improved package..."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Run beacons."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "So you wanted to do missions or
what?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes...I would love to,
but...since everyone is getting ready to head out into the wild deep..."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why would hauling without the
anchor package help your goals?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Because I can't get that
anchor package without hauling or salvaging or something..."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Because hauling gives a bit
of energy and cash. So, I am presuming he rather do that than salvage."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well not everybody. There will be
many still around."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, what are you looking for,
missions, or a hauling partner? Can't do both at once."

Keegan's trip?"

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah man! Actually...if someone
wants to lead missions, I'll volunteer. Other than that, I will go salvage."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Who else wants missions, then?"
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Morris, if you can't get those missions
organized, I can go haul with ya, we can use my ship if you like."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Morris you are doing your
missions from sVP for salvaging right?"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I would have, if I hadn't arrived
at the Bubble just right now."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I'll gun."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not since I got back the other

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I can do missions in fifteen
minutes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That works. I'll go run this

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Well how many do we have now?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Okay."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

You find yourself inside the large docking bay of the Starship Museum, which
seems to double as a lobby. Strategically-placed booths sell tickets to citizens
of every alliance. Large signs list the ticket prices, and state that starship
pilots get in free. Small children stare at you in awe, perhaps considering
their own dreams of becoming starship pilots, while worried parents pull them
further away from you. Researchers and people with an interest in such things
gather around the older starships, making sketches or making a note of every
reentry scorch mark or laser scar. Two large archways lead northwest and
northeast; however, the northeast archway is apparently considered an exit, and
entry is blocked. To the south is the entrance to the museum's ITPN station.

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, and a polished
rosewood bar here.
You can go south and out.

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

able to repay the loan back as of the time your ship blew up. You could also ask
for assistance IC. I do not remember the cost of cargo haulers and the
fighters."

preference for which channel I use to ask? Or any is ok."

situation so shipless."

who got themselves shipless, and probably not the last either. What happened?"

landing pad."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I mean, other than your ship
obviously getting blown up."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, uhm, well that is not
strange, that is, forgive me, a bit stupid. You probably were attacked by
pirates while you were slumbering.\."

and life support dumped him out with a pod."

charge you get stuck in a bubble but the ship stays in one piece."

from something, I guess? What do you have experience with so far?"

mostly salvaging."

you."

give me their blue?"

blue. See? Too much."

will find cool stuff out there."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I'd pay 3 bilion for blue if I
had it."

yellow out of my suit."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "29 minutes ETA!"
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "So what GMG colours do you have, michael
Winters? And if you wonder why I use your last name, I am sharing a ship with a
fellow alliance pilot of yours."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Do you have a combat upgraded
gemini or should I get things for mine?"
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I have the one for seekers."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Yellow and blue."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ooh! So if you wanted to, we could go to
GMG some time as well?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Hmm. Could blue and yellow go with red
and yellow?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "I thought so."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "We could, yeah."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, as long as the end result is red,
blue, yellow, in whatever order. Doesn't matter which colour is in the mix
twice."

remember, no more falling asleep in space?"

[Notification from Starseekers] The organization has received 4,261,662.10 EAOS
credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll
Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So what is everyone up to?"
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "Debating on what to do."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have that same problem, I
have no idea what I feel like doing."
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Trying to avoid getting blown
up, not getting very far though."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Not getting blown up is
generally a good idea. Did you nearly lose a ship or something?"
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Not a ship, battle suits.
Just thought I'd do a little ground work, and have come close to being done a
couple of times during this last one, the first two I didn't seem to have much
of an issue with, but this last one was tougher, wonder if I may have the wrong
suit or something."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ouch!"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What suit do you have?"
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Tier 1 AEU."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, they are pretty fragile."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Let's keep it
up! That second performance goal is nearly ours!"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The SVP missions in it are not
so dreadful, but the low deps on New erth were tough as hell."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Until I had regen on my suit, I
often had to take cover and fix my suit with repair drones. Wish I'd had a
rental back then."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "Tier two rentals are sexy."
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Ah, the ones I'm doing are on
old earth, so perhaps I could have the same thing here as well then. Will have
to do a little salvaging to get some funds back to be able to repair it again
now."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You've got that right!"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If you want, and you have the
credits for it, I can take you to Helios so you can get a rental there? They are
a bit more sturdy and their chainguns do a bit more damage. Their reps are about
half as strong though but they manage."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If we had enough people, we
could do a nest."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "I would like to join one
actually."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "I could bring a 1.5 league,
or a tier 2 rental."
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "How much do they cost to
rent?"
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "I could bring a tier 2 league,
but I could always get another battlesuit."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, they are long term rentals
and cost about the same as your AEU tier 1, I think."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Let me finish setting up this
last shift for my belt workers, and we can organize this nest."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "Speaking of that."
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Ah, will have to think about
that then, but likely won't join for a nest though, think I've battled against
enough enemies for one day, just about to call it for a day."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So we have michael winters in a
rental 2 or a league 1.5, Simon, what again did you say you had, a league tier
2?"
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "Yeah, but I can get any other
suit you might need, I have a secon lsot."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "If he brings the league 2,
I'll bring the rental 2."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And, it's a shame, it would
definitely help you get those funds you are after."
[General Communication] Simon Collins transmits, "A second slot that is."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We are currently only the 3 of
us."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Morris, you wouldn't happen to be
interested in a nest?"
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "So no nest then?"
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "I am, but can't at the moment. I
am...otherwise engaged."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, right."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I guess not."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "What are you doing that you shouldn't
be?"
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew laughs.
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Or who."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters laughs.
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "How about I need about a 5 gallon drum
of coffee. And Michael...nope."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "What happened to the cadet that they
need cash so bad?"
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Michael King?"
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Raiyoku whatever his last name is?"
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Can anyone suggest what would
be a good suit to go with for a beginner? Talking with some of the other cadets
in the academy suggested that the AEU was a good one to go for, but it doesn't
seem to be very strong, but it's great that it has the repair feature so you
don't have to use up repair drones."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "Rental is good."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I definitely suggest
rental if you want to do solo things."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "The one that needs dough."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Told ya...I'm half asleep."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Go back to bed."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rental is amazing. Get a
rental."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Couch bro. Couch."
[Starseekers] Michael Winters transmits, "Well go back to the couch then."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "And I'm about to drift off in the next
10 seconds I think."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Raioku's suit got blown up or so, and
this King gu lost his ship in space, fell asleep. I think both are a little low
on credits although I managed to give the Fringe guy a hand."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "The insomnia has caught up with me."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It will cost you a few milion I
think although yu will get some credits back from the sale of your AEU."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah ok. Well I'm about to drift off. If
the Leagur needs cash when I wake up, maybe I can donate."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew snores.
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew mumbles. "Sorry..."
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Ah, might have to look in to
that then, even if it's just to start me off, might even have a look at it
tomorrow."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, talk to someone. To get
it back from helios, you need a ship that can move battlesuits, like mule or
gemini. I wil gladly take you there tomorrow."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew mumbles. "Oh...have them both check into loans ok?
dunno if they might have. just thought about it."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "That was the problem. One of them stil
had to pay back a loan and had no way of getting any funds, but that is sorted."
[General Communication] Raiyoku Ruatha transmits, "Thanks Kim, will see about
getting some funds first though as I'm pretty sure I'm a little low at the
moment."
[Starseekers] "Ok." Morris Corlew mumbles. "If she can get a kit would you take
her hauling since you really don't want me on a nest?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi there, debris monster."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hi t/ere Kim."
[General Communication] Michael King transmits, "Hi hi."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That your new ship, michael
King? Nice!"

in a few."

knocking on the outside of it."

what I want to do."
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "I can understand that
statement..i am doing salvaging. boring but it has to be done."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I might actually do some
salvaging of my own."
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "I hope you enjoy it more then
I do."
[General Communication] Mike Marshall laughs.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I probably will not enjoy it
much."
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "I wish I could do beacons but
I have no more that I am able to do.. I wold do tesla but well not right now.."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Where are you salvaging from?"
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "C-15."

love it and cant get enough of it."

space. We all are, if you want to get technical about it."
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley laughs.
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "Oh yeah.. duh."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am definitely not floating in
space?"
[General Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "I was wondering why I had
bought that spacesuit I never seem to wear."
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley transmits, "If you're not actually
floating in space, you're on a planet, which is."

It's back on primary power."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
#G!*N.6f+!lg6`h^|uEmt$A7%sNsEN^S][f0_~P8
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2580 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Southsouthwest and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Critical Strike.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a discount beacon launcher here.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Omicron-0" and the five-person A.S.S.
tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.

Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Up until recently I thought I had it, but evidently I have everything else but
the blueprint to make the robots themselves. If anyone has one lying around or
comes across one, let me know so we can work something out.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
