-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

04:08:54 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

22:58:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:58:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:58:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:58:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:58:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:58:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:58:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:58:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:58:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:58:47 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:58:49 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

22:58:50 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

22:58:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:59:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:59:27 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:59:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:59:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:59:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:59:43 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at Pengyou Homelife; Mail Room.

22:59:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:59:50 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:59:50 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:59:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

You can go south and out.

23:00:06 You say, "Mekensie contents."

23:00:07 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Caretaking task has been canceled."

23:00:07 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "I am currently holding a container of fish food, a hull brush, a tube of Rust-B-Gone, a tube of weapon grease, and a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow"."

23:00:13 A large light red soldier felo marches south.

23:00:18 You need a free hand to take that.

23:00:22 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:00:24 You put a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt in a red nylon mesh shopping bag.

Subject: Project Alpha 777
Date: June 1st 2317 

Hello,

This letter is to inform you about a final decision I have made on behalf of Starseekers with regards of making rift inserters available for this project.
Let me first explain that this decision is not to do with Starseeker's amount of megacredits, points or anything else. Starseekers is always willing to help newer pilots, and will continue to do so while I am its leader. So, whether Alpha 777 is actually helping newer pilots is the defining factor in the decision I reached.
So, how helpful is 777 to newer pilots? Most pilots go through a phase where they believe that shipwrecks earn them industry points faster than anything else. I've gone through it as well, so I know how it works. Generally speaking, a pilot does one load of shipwrecks, one load of commets, and bam, shipwrecks give more points. This is not really an accurate measure though. Travel time to 777, as well as the time to grapple and then expel larger pieces need to be taken into account, and then the conclusion is that local places such as Belt of Orion can lead to similar results just as fast, and without as much encouragement to grind senselessly.
Another matter worth considering are artifacts. The opinions on this are somewhat mixed, but if you take travel time into account again, and the fact that both in Battle of Mir and in 777 you can have lucky days where you find artifacts quickly, and 
23:05:14 days where the hunt goes slowly, it would seem there is not all that much difference. The payout for these artifacts is also really the same.
Even if you were to disagree with me on those 2 points, safety of our newer pilots is a big concern. I keep hearing stories about newer pilots getting in trouble with IFS and pirates. Watchtowers are nice things, but whether a pilot, particularly one with a slower engine, can actually land successfully with the long range lasers, is a question I can not answer positively with yes. Chances are that too many newer pilots get their ships damaged or even destroyed, in some cases even needing to be rescued by more experienced pilots. Take into account that light transports only have 4 hours of charge, the newer pilots we intend to help with 777 actually really have quite a few obstacles to deal with.
Another matter that probably also was a big defining factor for me was your patience, or lack of it. 2 weeks ago, Melinda told me she was going to see if similar locations could be found closer to home. I advised evenia to hold off on replacing the stations because of this reason. Although nothing suitable was found, the least that could have been done was for you to give us a chance. Instead, you chose to replace these stations anyway without inserters, which is your right if you wish. You also chose to ferry newer pilots who do not yet have rift drives across in your carriers. That is all g
23:05:14 ood and well, until the point where I have to hear from Morris that you are unhappy with the work this brings. The world does not stop turning when people have to live without 777's shipwrecks for a few weeks. This haste and impatience leads me to believe that new pilots are not all this is about. Personal advancement of pilots with plenty points to salvage anywhere they like, and maybe the advancement of your org which is working hard for its command points, seem to be just as much on your minds here. That is not wrong, but, and forgive me if this sounds harsh, not the reason why we would want to be involved in 777.

There has been a lot of debate going on about these stations ever since they were first built. On behalf of Starseekers, I have decided that supplying rift inserters for this project is not really reaching the goal of helping newer pilots. For this reason we are pulling out of 777 as of this date. To prevent us from continuing to go in circles, I also have decided that Starseekers will not revisit this decision for at least another 365 days.
I can understand this decision is disappointing. Once you reach sufficient command points you can build what you wish, but we will not support 777 from here on out for the reasons offered in this writing.

With kind regards,
Kim Saunders
