[Alliance Information Center]
The alliance information center is a small, oddly imposing room with three
hallways running out of it. The walls are painted with a light shade of tan that
seems to flow off the wall and blend seamlessly with the soft carpet beneath
your feet. Above the doorway to each hall hangs a large, colorful emblem for the
alliance within. A long, polished desk runs in a u-shape around the room,
breaking only to allow entrance through one of the doors leading to the
individual alliance information rooms. Behind the desk a number of men and
women, all wearing the same style of impeccably tailored business suit, stare
out into the group of new recruits, ready to help.
For help, type TALK REPRESENTATIVE.

[Hale Information Center]
The Hale Collective, more often known simply as the Hale, is devoted solely to
scientific endeavors. The vast majority of modern technologies that people use
every day were developed by the Hale, a fact that its members often boast about.
This tends to give them a reputation of being arrogant. They have no qualms with
bringing their advanced technology to bear against those who challenge them in
any respect. To become a member of this alliance, type CHOOSE now.

[Commonwealth Information Center]
The Commonwealth of Free Spirits, more commonly referred to as the Commonwealth,
believe that humanity has become too violent and fragmented and should
concentrate on improving the species before technological or territorial
expansion. However, should they come under direct assault, the Commonwealth will
not hesitate to defend themselves. While not as technologically advanced as the
Hale, the Commonwealth has a number of impressive technologies at their disposal
for deterring or, if necessary, eliminating their enemies. To become a member of

[AIE Information Center]
The Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists, or AIE, are explorers at heart. They
believe that humanity's efforts should be directed toward dominating the stars
before dominating each other. As the first alliance to break away from Earth and
discover Miriani, the AIE are used to people operating the way they're told. As
such, they can be a bit overbearing in their beliefs and somewhat impatient with
the other alliances. Their technology deals primarily with exploration and
discovery. To become a member of this alliance, type CHOOSE now.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome.
Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the
heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at
the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors
which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The
granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the
constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic
landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These
are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this
busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a
smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the two-person asteroid hauler "Digger", the one-person cargo hauler
"Reliant", and the two-person asteroid hauler "Violet Rose" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the four-person roborant "Malevolent
Fatality", and the one-person cargo hauler "Junk Scooper" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome.
Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the
heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at
the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors
which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The
granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the
constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic
landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These
are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this
busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a
smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the two-person asteroid hauler "Digger", the one-person cargo hauler
"Reliant", and the two-person asteroid hauler "Violet Rose" powered down here.

You walk northeast.
[Acrylon Spaceport; Corridor]
Situated at the end of a long corridor, this small open area is surrounded by
doorways with eye-catching signs and advertisements posted around them. The red
and indigo floor tiles are dotted here and there with tiny yellow stars which
shimmer faintly under the large lights set into the high ceiling. The rearming
center is to the west, and directly across from it to the east is the starship
repair facility. To the south, a wide archway leads into the medical facility.
To the southwest, scaled down models of starships advertize the planet's
starship store. To the southeast is the renaming center.
You can go northwest, east, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

with brilliantly bright colors. Tall windows reaching nearly from floor to

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome.
Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the
heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at
the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors
which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The
granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the
constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic
landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These
are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this
busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a
smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the four-person roborant "Malevolent
Fatality", and the one-person cargo hauler "Junk Scooper" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the
droid, Sputnik the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Sia the droid,
Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby

are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of

[Acrylon Spaceport; Corridor]
Situated at the end of a long corridor, this small open area is surrounded by
doorways with eye-catching signs and advertisements posted around them. The red
and indigo floor tiles are dotted here and there with tiny yellow stars which
shimmer faintly under the large lights set into the high ceiling. To the north,
three columned doorways lead into the Acrylon couriering center. To the north is
the Acrylon courier lobby, to the northwest is the Acrylon courier company
starship acquisition center, and to the northeast is the Acrylon courier company
cargo request center. An arched entrance to the east leads into the mail room,
while to the west is a busy starship supply store.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Starship Supplies]
Two short steps lead down into this busy little supply shop which is tiled in
tiny squares of red, orange, and brown. The shelves lining the walls have built
in bins holding a jumble of charge boosters and other supplies. A display of
trash cans and mailboxes in a choice selection of colors and styles takes up the
entirety of the back wall. A tall sales droid moves effortlessly between the
crowd of customers.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome.
Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the
heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at
the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors
which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The
granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the
constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic
landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These
are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this
busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a
smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
