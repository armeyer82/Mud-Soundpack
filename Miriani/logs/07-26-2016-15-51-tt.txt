Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a compact red refrigerator, Jewel
the large violet glowing felo, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

Hello all,
A bit belated, but with the help of Lily, I put up a salvage processor and op
station out at 465. Repair and rearm is included on the op station. Happy

[Starship "Akrep"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

I finally sat down and read every one of the last fifty-two posts or so.
Thank you, hosts, for expressing and clarifying some things I badly needed to
hear, but didn't realize I needed to hear.
One thing that's been in my mind a whole lot lately is the question "How would
my char react?" And, "Would my char sit there, silent, or would she take a
stance? If so, what stanace?"
I hear the concerns of some of you--I've felt that struggle that if even one or
two of the longer-played characters disagreed with some action or statement your
char made, it might all be over. I don't have a good response to that, except
that sometimes, we do need to push through, and roleplay through any possible
consequences.
On the other hand, I absolutely agree with the hosts that doing nothing is far,
far worse than doing something. As I have said to people in real-life
conversation, you can't sit on the fence forever. Eventually, you fall off, or
you're in too much pain to sit there. You have to act. This is something I've
been struggling with, and now that I'm aware of it, and have read these
extremely thought-provoking posts, I hope I can become a better roleplayer for
it. That is what so much of this roleplay journey is--learning from other
people, whether IC or OOC, learning about yourself, about your character, what
things do or do not work for you in an RP setting.
If the game is not fun for you, then it is time to ask a few questions about
whether to take your character in a different direction, to reroll and try
something new. That said, there is a ton of potential if a situation is complex,
if you can wade through what's going on to see it through. It builds the
character, and I think it can teach us, as players, a thing or two. I've been
sad to see characters retire sometimes, because I very badly wanted to know what
might have happened had they stayed.

These posts have also been beyond helpful for me as someone is is very new to
RP. So thank you to the hosts who have commented here, to the players who have
responded, and to the wonderful host, whoever it was, that replied to my
questions yesterday.
That being said, I have a few things to add, some of them have already been
said, but hopefully my reiterating them in my own words will make a difference,
perhapse make them hit home for someone.
First, I think people do sometimes need a nudge. Until I read these last 50
posts or so have given me a bit of a nudge for my character, where I was kind of
waiting for something to happen. But, in good roleplay, I am learning, just as
in life, we can't wait for everything to happen to us. And really, in our ooc
lives, do we actually do that? For most of us, and even the rest, only rarely,
is that the case. Even if we don't go out and make the world spin around us, we
react to it and in doing so, make our own changes to the world. I have met very
few people that let everything happen and don't have a few controvercial
thoughts from time to time.
So, that being said, I think we might need a nudge to remind us that we
shouldn't let our characters be like that. Even the quietest person has a view
that will conflict, does something that makes waves every now and then. I
learned that we can ask for that nudge, and there are amazing folks who will
respond and give great feedback.
That being said, I definitely see the benefit and welcome hostly intervention to
help give us the push we need. However, I don't think that the hosts have the
time or energy to  push us into acting all the time. We do need to take some
initiative.
I apologize if this is a bit rambly, I'm just writing as I think and am slightly
distracted. Anyway, it's our responsibility to sometimes do the difficult thing,
to sometimes do what makes us uncomfortable. As Rahima said (and thank you for
this), it is how we grow, not just as roleplayers, but also as people in
general. I think SC can be a very interesting place when everyone puts effort
into effecting the world they live in. Is that hard? Yeah. But remember, just
because something is a little difficult doesn't mean the reward won't outweigh
the difficulty of it.
I really look forward to any events, for things to happen. But that is all of
our responsibility. Be true to your character. If you think they might do
something but aren't sure it makes sense, ask about it! We want stories! We want
things to think about! We want things to decide, to act on, to play around.
I spend a lot of time here. I enjoy it here. This is a giant stress relief for
me. I love feeling that I am doing many things at one time, reading a book that
I am part of writing, acting in a play that I am helping write. Being involved
in the process of a different life of a different person...of different people
and a different world. So, thank you to all of you who make the experience what
it is, both the playerbase and the hosts.

I too have seen a few people retire or just vanish, and a bit of a common theme
has been that they can't influence things or get the co-opperation they need.
Perceverance can get you through this period, but I feel like it can be very
difficult for new and nearly new pilots, in particular, to feel that they can
influence much or bring things about. I am finding that as time goes, I am
getting better at this and finding more I can get involved with. However, I do
feel that, somehow, more help could be around for those, particularly new to
role play, who are no longer cadets, but still have comparitively low skills.
Yes, people do need to try, and to work for things, but I can well see people at
certain stages feeling like it can be very difficult. With all that, I am
agreeing that the odd nudge could be really helpful, and maybe tips relative to
your level or something?

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, and a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with
a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees here.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

the five-person pulsar "Critical Strike"
You see a gunship here.
"Critical Strike" is written along its hull in flaming crimson letters.
The designation "AR-7C" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a white color with silver trim. Its laser turrets
are blackened and outlined in silvery gray. The bays of its minicannon launchers
are clean and painted silvery gray. Its landing struts are clean and painted
white.
It has a blue AEU logo forward on the starboard side and a smooth dome and a
geodesic radome on the forward end.

Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 160
This ship will allow you to move around temporary space station modules and
position them properly so that you can create a temporary space structure in the
sector of your choice. Despite being a light cruiser, this vessel does not have
a docking bay, replacing the dockin bay with the module bay. It can hold up to
28 temporary space station modules.

AFW SPACE MODULE SCOUT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 20 industry points        300 exploration points

Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
This ship, though smaller than its cousin and able to fit only seven temporary
space station modules has two hours more charge, and also has an exploration
point requirement. Even with this exploration point requirement however, it does

AC-2X SPACE CONSTRUCTOR 100,000,000.00 (Aenea)
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 2500 industry points
Model number: AC-2X                     Designation: Space Constructor
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 10000        Standard battery hours: 12
Docking bay size required: 225
This vessel is able to hold 28 temporary space station modules, just like the
module transport. However, this particular design which is currently only
available to the AEU, has the added benefits of not needing space lifters at all
for temporary station construction. This is because you can construct the
temporary stations from inside the docking bay, and thenjust push the station
itself out when you need to. It appears that you can have more than one
temporary station constructed and ready for deployment in the module bay at any
given time, but the modules used in the construction will still count towards
the module bay's total limit.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
