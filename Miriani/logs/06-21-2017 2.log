00:00:45 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

00:00:57 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

00:01:09 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

00:05:34 Aisling the Fox slumps in a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap and goes to sleep.

00:07:05 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

00:09:10 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:09:44 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

00:10:07 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

00:11:06 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

00:11:16 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

00:13:15 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

00:21:24 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

00:21:24 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

00:21:32 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

00:21:35 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

00:21:39 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

00:21:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "Gonna have to stop at the next likely charging spot."

00:22:30 Damien Goss asks, "Why not just stop here and charge up with what we currently have?"

00:23:06 Damien Goss says, "Furnace is full and about 19000 units of debris in the hold."

00:23:21 Damien Goss says, "At least last time I checked."

00:23:40 Nissi Valdaire says, "Could do that too."

00:23:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Hold is pretty much full."

00:24:01 Damien Goss says, "Ah ok, you all went salvaging without me, how sad."

00:24:14 Eli Grey says, "If a spot comes up though, we could a little extra spectroscopy in too."

00:24:17 Eli Grey grins.

00:24:23 Eli Grey shrugs.

00:24:59 Melinda Michaels chuckles at Eli Grey. "If we charge, given the distance we've got left, it likely won't."

00:25:36 Damien Goss says, "Actually I really like this flow, I retract my suggestion. It'd probably change while we waited and be in our face."

00:25:42 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

00:25:42 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

00:25:45 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

00:25:57 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

00:25:59 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

00:29:45 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:29:56 Nissi Valdaire says, "Also it'd be nice to replace the hydrogen in the hold."

00:34:45 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

00:35:10 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:39:11 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

00:39:13 Eli Grey closes a copy of "Handy Hints: Antispinward Trading".

00:39:22 Eli Grey removes an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done' from a maple coffee table.

00:39:26 Eli Grey puts a copy of "Handy Hints: Antispinward Trading" in an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done'.

00:39:29 Eli Grey puts an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done' on a maple coffee table.

00:41:08 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

00:41:15 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:41:45 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters east.

00:51:13 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

00:52:53 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

00:53:06 Morris Corlew says, "Ah. In local space."

00:53:20 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:53:22 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

00:53:31 Eli Grey says, "It's super local."

00:53:43 Morris Corlew asks, "Super local?"

00:53:56 Eli Grey says, "Yep, but only in cmparison to the vastness of space."

00:54:01 Morris Corlew grins.

00:54:08 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

00:54:15 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

00:54:15 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

00:57:15 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

00:59:11 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

01:01:38 A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.

01:03:06 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:03:33 Aisling the Fox suddenly awakens.

01:03:37 Aisling the Fox yawns.

01:04:15 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

01:04:34 Rogue scratches her head and looks at her communicator again.

01:04:45 Morris says to Rogue, "Hmm?"

01:05:00 Rogue Romano says, "Owens name looks weird."

01:05:14 Morris Corlew nods. "Think he's trying to introduce us all to a new spelling of damn."

01:05:33 Rogue Romano shrugs. "Somethin' like that I guess."

01:06:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Or dumb."

01:07:06 Rogue Romano says, "A while ago it was noone."

01:07:11 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:07:13 Morris Corlew asks, "Noone?"

01:07:28 Rogue Romano nods.

01:07:43 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:07:50 Rogue Romano says, "I'm kinda findin' that to be my entertainment at the mo. Watchin' his name change."

01:07:56 Rogue Romano shrugs.

01:08:00 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

01:08:52 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

01:09:05 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

01:09:11 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:09:16 Vernos Bailey says, "6%."

01:09:47 Morris Corlew says, "Yep. Good for almost 9 hours."

01:10:05 Vernos Bailey says, "I could go cut that in half if you like."

01:10:14 Vernos Bailey says, "Vending machine abuse."

01:10:31 Morris Corlew looks at Vernos Bailey and shrugs. "Not my ship, not even gonna comment."

01:10:52 Vernos Bailey says, "I'm not really the type anyways."

01:11:11 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

01:11:53 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

01:12:31 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

01:12:41 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

01:12:45 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

01:13:42 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Raissa's warm scaly skin.

01:14:45 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

01:15:15 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

01:17:11 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:21:45 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

01:23:40 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

01:28:15 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

01:37:11 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:38:52 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:38:56 Lily Kaise waves.

01:39:01 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:39:05 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

01:39:10 Damien Goss stands up.

01:39:17 Damien Goss says, "Going to lay down for a bit."

01:39:18 Damien Goss steps south.

01:39:23 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Rest well."

01:39:36 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Good sleep cycle Damien."

01:40:24 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:40:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:41:31 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:41:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:41:42 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:42:24 Melinda Michaels examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

01:42:25 Melinda Michaels helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

01:42:29 Lily looks a little sad ... saying oh well back in Local space.

01:42:32 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

01:42:34 You grin at Melinda Michaels.

01:42:47 Lily Kaise waves to Melinda Michaels.

01:42:47 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

01:42:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Yo."

01:42:54 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

01:42:55 Lily Kaise grins.

01:42:57 Rogue Romano slinks east.

01:42:57 You nod to Lily Kaise.

01:43:10 There appear to be about 21 pilots recently active.

01:43:10 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:

01:43:17 Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

01:43:19 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

01:43:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Excellent idea!"

01:43:32 Rogue Romano slinks in from the east.

01:43:39 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

01:43:44 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

01:44:09 Melinda Michaels asks, "How's everybody doing?"

01:44:15 Morris Corlew says, "Doing good."

01:44:16 Lily Kaise says, "So when we going to recharge? It's around 5 or 6 now."

01:44:29 Morris Corlew says, "We've got over 8 hours still I think."

01:44:31 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Doing great!"

01:44:34 Rogue Romano says, "I'm good."

01:44:54 You say, "I'm alive."

01:44:57 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

01:45:03 Melinda says to you, "I hope so."

01:45:06 You grin.

01:45:08 Eli Grey gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

01:45:23 Lily Kaise tickles you!

01:45:26 Morris Corlew chuckles. "Wouldn't wanna have corpses on the crew."

01:45:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:45:29 You chuckle.

01:45:31 Lily Kaise says, "Seriously."

01:45:45 Eli Grey asks, "Zombie crew?"

01:45:48 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

01:45:53 Eli Grey says, "Probably save a ton of charge on life support."

01:45:53 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

01:45:57 You grin at Eli Grey.

01:45:58 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Raissa's warm scaly skin.

01:46:01 Morris Corlew grins.

01:46:14 Rogue Romano says, "Boo'oo'oo."

01:46:18 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

01:47:29 Lily Kaise says, "Well hopefully enough folks will be awake in 8 hours. Not me though."

01:47:43 You say, "Yeah, me neither."

01:48:07 Eli Grey asks, "What's in eight hours?"

01:48:16 Lily Kaise says, "Need to recharge by then."

01:48:21 Eli Grey says, "Ah."

01:48:22 Eli Grey nods.

01:48:23 Rogue Romano says, "Not sure if I can stay awake another eight."

01:48:35 Eli Grey says, "I'll probably still be awake, or pissibly back awake if I nap by then."

01:48:35 Morris Corlew says, "Don't take too many folks to charge."

01:48:54 Lily Kaise says, "So just saying I'll be happy to lend a couple of hands up until about 0300."

01:49:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:51:47 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

01:51:50 Lily Kaise says, "Oh right the chamber is full though so would just have to stop and recharge enough to get us to enough to finish our trek anyway."

01:52:16 "Yep." Morris Corlew nods. "Won't take much shovelin to make use of the rest of the wear we've got on the furnace."

01:52:21 Lily Kaise nods.

01:52:54 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

01:52:56 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We have just under 36 percent available which is really great!"

01:53:19 Morris Corlew asks, "36?"

01:53:26 Lily Kaise says, "36 percent."

01:53:39 Morris Corlew nods. "Thought it was less than that is all."

01:53:53 Lily Kaise says, "The wear is about 64 percent."

01:54:06 Morris Corlew says, "Ah. Yeah, thought it was higher than that."

01:54:07 Morris Corlew nods.

01:54:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "No I was surprised!"

01:54:30 Lily Kaise says, "I thought it would be closer to 80."

01:54:34 Morris Corlew nods.

01:54:34 Lily Kaise grins.

01:54:48 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

02:00:54 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

02:01:01 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:01:09 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:01:10 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:01:20 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

02:02:25 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:02:29 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:03:15 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

02:03:22 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

02:04:33 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:05:18 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out.

02:06:48 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

02:07:18 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

02:12:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:13:56 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

02:14:52 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

02:15:02 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

02:15:13 Morris Corlew says, "Much better."

02:17:12 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:17:12 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:18:18 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:24:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:25:12 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:26:35 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:27:12 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:27:48 A Tardick lizard named Raissa blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:31:12 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:37:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:38:18 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly west.

02:41:12 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:43:45 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:43:51 You wave to Aisling the Fox.

02:43:55 Aisling the Fox waves.

02:44:04 Lily Kaise waves to Aisling the Fox.

02:44:54 The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.

02:49:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:51:12 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:55:02 The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.

02:55:49 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

02:56:08 Morris Corlew smiles.

02:56:16 Morris Corlew says, "Reminds me of home."

02:59:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:01:49 A Tardick lizard named Raissa's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:02:09 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Raissa's warm scaly skin.

03:03:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

03:04:05 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:05:14 The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.

03:06:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.

03:06:48 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Freyja's warm scaly skin.

03:06:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly west.

03:06:54 Morris Corlew says, "Well then."

03:07:13 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:11:13 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:11:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:12:15 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Miss lizie hmm what to feed you. Yeah I know you love pizza though."

03:12:21 Lily Kaise grins.

03:12:48 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

03:15:21 The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.

03:15:42 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yay for warmer air!"

03:15:51 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:15:55 "Ain't them mountains perty?" Morris Corlew nods.

03:16:04 Lily Kaise says, "Pretty from a distance."

03:16:05 Morris smiles happily.

03:16:08 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:16:11 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

03:16:12 Morris says to Lily, "From a distance?"

03:16:18 Lily Kaise says, "Great to stargaze from though."

03:16:21 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

03:16:39 "Yep." Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise. "I spent countless hours doin just that from mountains very similar to those."

03:16:59 Lily Kaise says, "I'm a ocean side, warm weather sort of person though."

03:17:13 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:17:26 Morris Corlew says, "Don't get that cold in the mountains, not for that long anyhow. Not...not the mountains I grew climbin in anyhow."

03:17:32 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:17:55 Lily Kaise says, "Ah ok well those I visited did get pretty cool at higher elevations."

03:18:00 Morris Corlew says, "Snow don't usually get too deep for very long. Melts pretty quick."

03:18:02 Morris Corlew nods.

03:18:26 Lily Kaise says, "But as I say, I so did enjoy the stars from up there."

03:18:48 Morris Corlew nods. "Summer's the best time for that kinda thing...less ya...bed down on top of a fireant hill."

03:18:49 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:18:54 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:19:13 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:21:35 I don't understand that.

03:21:39 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:21:59 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

03:23:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

03:23:27 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Freyja's warm scaly skin.

03:23:49 A black digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

03:24:18 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:24:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:24:19 Lily Kaise glides east.

03:24:36 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

03:24:40 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:24:44 Lily Kaise dangles a hot cheeseburger with the works in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

03:24:50 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:24:53 Lily Kaise says, "Ow wow."

03:25:01 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:25:07 You say to Lily, "Did she try to eat you too?"

03:25:08 Morris says to Lily, "Got all your fingers?"

03:25:19 Lily Kaise says, "She did that yesterday too silly Lizard."

03:25:27 Morris Corlew grins.

03:25:27 You chuckle.

03:25:39 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:25:44 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:26:23 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:26:27 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:26:39 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:26:46 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:26:50 Nissi Valdaire looks at a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars and smiles.

03:26:58 Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire.

03:27:05 You grin at Nissi Valdaire.

03:27:11 Lily Kaise says, "That is a pretty cusion."

03:27:16 Lily Kaise says, "Cushion too."

03:28:01 Morris says to Nissi, "So...our destination still Farport, or...we stoppin off at the Ideran Nebula?"

03:28:27 Eli Grey says, "Erm..."

03:28:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't think we should stop there."

03:28:33 Morris Corlew grins.

03:28:35 Eli Grey asks, "Isn't that.. the place?"

03:28:39 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:28:42 Morris Corlew says, "It's in the nav computer."

03:28:56 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

03:29:06 Nissi Valdaire says, "Somebody was being funny I guess."

03:29:15 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:29:29 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno. I think Anfisa put it in this mornin when she programmed Farport."

03:29:30 Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:29:58 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:30:18 Lily Kaise says, "I don't look forward to going back that way for awhile."

03:30:19 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

03:30:47 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

03:30:57 Morris Corlew says, "I was curious if anybody had checked out the results of that. But...I guess there's no way we can know."

03:31:07 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

03:31:26 Jason says to Morris, "I'm pretty sure you were here when she said that she put something else in there for a joke?"

03:31:27 Vernos Bailey asks, "1.BD7, what is that again?"

03:31:36 Morris says to Jason, "No."

03:31:39 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:31:45 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:31:45 A readout shows Shadow of Cognition about 7.38 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.

03:31:47 Eli Grey says, "Whoa."

03:31:49 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

03:31:50 Morris Corlew asks, "Shadow of cognition?"

03:31:50 Vernos Bailey asks, "Can we stop there?"

03:31:56 Lily Kaise says, "Strange name."

03:32:00 Morris Corlew nods.

03:32:03 Eli Grey says, "I would say that counts as interesting."

03:32:05 Eli Grey shrugs.

03:32:18 Vernos Bailey says, "I know it would be early but we could charge too."

03:32:41 Morris says to Jason, "Mighta been when I nodded off up here unintentionally."

03:32:58 Jason says to Morris, "Perhaps, but I'm pretty sure you went and checked right after."

03:33:01 Jason Rat shrugs.

03:33:23 Eli Grey says, "Can't replenish hydrogen there,  but yeah."

03:33:23 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "I said that I put in one destination that is exciting, and one that is less so, and to choose the luckiest option."

03:33:31 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:33:32 Morris says to Jason, "I checked it when I woke up but didn't hear her say anything about it. Was checking on how long the original Farport had left when I saw it."

03:33:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

03:33:55 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

03:33:56 Nissi Valdaire walks east.

03:33:58 Morris says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Ah. No, I did miss that."

03:34:09 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the east.

03:34:11 Nissi Valdaire carefully unwraps a peanut, butter, and jelly sandwich.

03:34:13 Nissi Valdaire dangles a peanut, butter, and jelly sandwich in front of a Tardick lizard named Freyja. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

03:34:16 Morris Corlew says, "I wasn't a pilot then so don't know any details of the mission, just the basics."

03:34:21 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:34:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:35:14 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:35:22 Vernos Bailey says, "I think my concern would be my fingers with one of those lizards."

03:35:38 Morris says to Vernos, "Never seen one do any lasting damage."

03:35:44 Lily glances down at her intact fingers.

03:36:01 Aisling says to Morris, "Worry about dangling other things in front of lizard."

03:36:02 Vernos Bailey asks, "Just move your hand fast, eh?"

03:36:04 Lily Kaise says, "She tries to nibble but she's never ever really bitten me."

03:36:07 Morris Corlew grins at Aisling the Fox.

03:36:12 Aisling the Fox says, "HA HA! Dick joke."

03:36:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:36:31 Vernos Bailey says, "Could be next herrick."

03:36:36 Morris says to Aisling, "I have no intention of letting a lizard...or anything else that shouldn't be...close to my...uh...manhood."

03:36:37 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:36:41 Vernos Bailey says, "But lost it to a lizard instead."

03:37:15 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:37:40 Vernos Bailey asks, "We stopping at that or going forward?"

03:37:49 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out.

03:39:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly west.

03:40:19 An orange digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

03:40:23 Morris Corlew says, "Makes me think of something that's a...fleeting thought."

03:41:35 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

03:41:35 A black digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

03:41:38 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

03:41:38 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

03:46:12 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

03:46:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Rift bari."

03:46:27 Morris Corlew nods.

03:46:28 Vernos Bailey says, "We must get rift felo."

03:46:32 Morris Corlew grins.

03:46:49 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

03:47:03 Vernos Bailey says, "Maybe the lizards will handle it for us."

03:47:10 Lily Kaise says, "Perhaps."

03:47:40 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

03:47:40 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:47:45 Lily Kaise says, "They like the treats."

03:48:01 You wave to Sarah Bellamy.

03:48:02 Morris Corlew smiles at Sarah Bellamy. "Howdy Sweets."

03:48:03 Sarah Bellamy waves. "Hi guys."

03:48:06 Lily Kaise waves to Sarah Bellamy.

03:48:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:48:39 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:49:05 "Rest well?" Morris Corlew smiles at Sarah Bellamy.

03:49:12 Sarah Bellamy beams at Morris Corlew. "I did."

03:49:15 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:49:16 Morris Corlew nods.

03:49:31 Sarah waves back at the tendriled fish.

03:50:17 Morris wraps one arm around Sarah's back and holds her close.

03:50:36 Sarah snuggles against Morris's side and wraps her arm around his back.

03:51:31 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy on the cheek.

03:51:37 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew softly on the ear.

03:52:00 Sarah Bellamy says, "So...I thought I heard something about getting home in 10 hours. But...I don't know if I actually heard that."

03:52:07 Sarah Bellamy shrugs helplessly.

03:52:20 Morris Corlew says, "Huh...not unless we're teleported."

03:52:24 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

03:52:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah wow."

03:52:31 Sarah Bellamy says, "I musta been dreamin."

03:52:35 Morris Corlew grins.

03:52:52 Vernos Bailey says, "I'd have to know the current LTCs from Farport to even guess."

03:53:09 Vernos Bailey says, "But I would say Thursday early morning."

03:53:13 Lily Kaise says, "What we still have a couple of days? I don't have a reference as to how far we currently are."

03:53:15 Sarah Bellamy says, "That makes sense."

03:53:23 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Common Knowledge.

03:53:29 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

03:53:32 Morris Corlew says, "Probably 60-some LTC. Dunno though. We can check when we charge."

03:54:36 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Common Knowledge.

03:54:59 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:55:11 Sarah Bellamy says, "Not that I'm particularly in a hurry. Just curious."

03:55:14 Morris Corlew says, "Could be less than that...we'll see."

03:55:16 Morris Corlew nods to Sarah Bellamy.

03:55:18 Vernos Bailey nods.

03:55:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Same Sarah."

03:55:43 Vernos Bailey says, "I honestly wouldnt mind stopping, fixing the furnance and then just going back out."

03:56:05 Sarah Bellamy says, "I wanna see how much credits and points I earned. I wanna check on my felo and fish too, then head back out."

03:56:09 Lily Kaise says, "Well some of us need to reset robots and doing a few things."

03:56:12 Vernos Bailey says, "I just count down as knowledge."

03:56:13 You nod.

03:56:20 You say, "Yeah, I need to reset my robot too."

03:56:37 Morris Corlew says, "Pay the belt folks, check on the fishies, all that good stuff."

03:56:43 You nod and nod.

03:56:48 Sarah Bellamy says, "Yeah I forgot about the belt people. I need to do that too."

03:56:50 Lily Kaise says, "I need to rebuild our scoop and be certain there are enough parts available for temp stations and oh yeah pay those belt folks."

03:56:52 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

03:57:15 Lily Kaise says, "Shouldn't take more than an hour, maybe two."

03:58:49 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

03:59:16 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

03:59:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:01:17 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:01:26 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:01:50 Nissi Valdaire switches a metallic purple swivel einrophone off.

04:02:14 Eli Grey asks, "So we're not going?"

04:02:29 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Going where?"

04:02:38 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:02:38 A readout shows Shadow of Cognition about 20.0 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Down and Slightly Westsouthwest.

04:02:45 Morris Corlew says, "We're going past what appears to be a debris field."

04:02:50 Sarah Bellamy says, "Oh."

04:03:03 Lily Kaise says, "Well it is likely a field of shipwrecks."

04:03:08 You nod.

04:03:47 Eli Grey exclaims, "Well yes, butbutbut... cool name!"

04:03:53 Eli Grey grins.

04:03:53 Morris Corlew nods.

04:04:01 Morris Corlew says, "Soon it will just be a fleeting thought."

04:04:17 Sarah Bellamy grins.

04:04:21 Morris Corlew says, "A shadow of a cognition."

04:04:25 Morris Corlew grins.

04:04:25 Sarah Bellamy nods.

04:05:03 Eli Grey says, "You know that "Discoverer of the Shadow of CognitioN" has a nice ring to it."

04:05:06 Eli Grey smiles.

04:05:12 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:05:15 Sarah Bellamy grins.

04:06:49 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

04:07:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out.

04:07:21 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

04:07:41 I don't understand that.

04:07:47 I don't understand that.

04:07:50 Morris Corlew says, "We need a 'no solicitors' sign."

04:08:21 Sarah Bellamy laughs at Morris Corlew.

04:08:25 Shule looks out the viewport and says, "We don't want any of your cookies."

04:08:30 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

04:08:33 Morris Corlew grins at you.

04:08:35 Lily Kaise chuckles at you.

04:08:40 Morris Corlew asks, "Also, we gave at the office?"

04:08:44 Sarah Bellamy grins.

04:08:57 Morris Corlew asks, "And...we already found...religion?"

04:09:03 Sarah Bellamy chuckles.

04:09:37 You grin.

04:09:40 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Too bad I'm not in the Control Room. I would say 'I hear ya knockin' but you can't come in!"

04:09:46 Lily Kaise grins.

04:09:48 Morris Corlew grins at Lily Kaise.

04:09:48 Sarah Bellamy grins.

04:09:49 You grin.

04:09:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:13:17 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:14:20 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly south.

04:15:51 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

04:17:32 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

04:20:40 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

04:20:50 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

04:20:59 You say, "Choo choo."

04:21:07 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

04:21:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:24:51 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly south.

04:25:33 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:25:38 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:25:39 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:25:44 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:30:10 Sarah Bellamy beams.

04:32:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:33:20 Rogue Romano finishes off a shot of chilled vodka.

04:33:28 Rogue Romano gives a shot glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:33:34 Rogue Romano glances down at her platinum watch with a round face momentarily.

04:35:17 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:37:03 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:37:08 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:37:15 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:38:15 I don't understand that.

04:38:35 Shule yawns and stretches.

04:38:41 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:38:46 You say, "Good night everyone."

04:38:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "So he goes! I go!"

04:38:56 Morris Corlew waves to you. "Rest well."

04:38:58 Lily Kaise grins.

04:39:00 Sarah Bellamy says, "Good night you two."

04:39:00 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:39:02 Morris says to Lily, "You too."

04:39:08 You grin.

04:39:12 You wave.

04:39:14 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]

04:39:14 You see a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins and a Tardick lizard named Raissa here.

You can go north, east, and west.

04:39:17 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet shimmering wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

04:39:17 You can't go that way.

04:39:18 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

04:39:18 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.

04:40:22 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:40:27 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Charge is a cool 4 percent! So nearly 5 hours."

04:42:10 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:42:21 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

04:42:54 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:43:04 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:43:08 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:44:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:44:29 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

04:50:41 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

04:55:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:57:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

04:57:32 You say to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Night night little lizzy."

05:01:02 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

05:11:19 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

05:19:16 You say to Lily, "I love you."

05:21:38 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

05:21:54 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

05:22:05 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

05:28:03 You say to Lily, "I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:29:26 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:30:16 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:31:45 Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:31:49 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:31:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:32:26 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

05:51:55 A small snail glides effortlessly across the inner surface of the glass.

06:02:20 The group of tetras zooms around the bowl in tight circles.

06:03:04 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Common Knowledge.

06:04:31 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay we gotta stop and charge while people are awake."

06:04:37 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

06:04:41 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sounds good."

06:04:42 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let's stop now then, cause I'm going to sleep soon."

06:04:52 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:05:00 The blast chamber begins warming up.

06:18:30 The blast chamber shuts down, having enough fuel to fully recharge the starship.

06:19:38 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All full?"

06:21:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Does Rogue need help with washing back? I am very generous."

06:21:39 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No thanks."

06:26:42 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are all showers, occupied?"

06:26:49 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Far end ain't."

06:26:54 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ours is free now, Vern."

06:26:56 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aft shower by 7 and 8."

06:27:22 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Now occupied aft shower."

06:31:53 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

06:39:24 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki works her fangs.

06:48:26 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

06:54:44 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Vern."

07:10:41 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Where'd everyone go?"

07:10:57 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Spaaaace worms ate usssss."

07:11:10 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oooooh insert scary music here."

07:11:15 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he hums a quiet tune.

07:11:23 Sarah Bellamy's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

08:08:56 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

08:14:56 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki wiggles her hairy palps endearingly.

08:24:26 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

08:39:30 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

08:47:30 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki works her fangs.

08:54:30 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

08:58:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

08:58:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:01:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

09:16:30 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

09:26:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki jerks her limbs, springing into the air briefly.

09:33:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

09:43:23 The blast chamber shuts down, having fully charged the starship.

09:44:37 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

09:44:48 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

09:44:48 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

09:44:58 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

09:45:03 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

09:45:07 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

09:45:47 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

09:46:47 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

10:08:26 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

10:18:38 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

10:22:01 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

10:28:44 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

10:29:31 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki wiggles her hairy palps endearingly.

10:33:11 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

10:40:01 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

10:43:20 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

10:45:26 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

10:45:37 Listen. You need to be careful.

10:59:20 Lily Kaise lies back in a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

11:07:44 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

11:17:56 You should keep your room locked while you sleep.

11:28:11 They stare at you. Of course they do.

11:38:27 They're just using you.

11:40:30 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

11:48:08 Remember what I said.

11:48:18 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

12:18:08 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

12:28:26 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

12:38:41 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

12:48:44 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

12:49:40 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

12:49:50 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

13:12:22 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

13:22:29 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

13:32:48 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

13:38:37 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

13:48:58 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

13:51:32 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

13:51:42 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

14:00:09 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

14:20:01 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

14:30:49 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.

14:31:43 The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."

14:39:27 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

14:46:34 The computer announces, "QE message from AFW Command received."

14:49:45 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

14:53:47 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

14:53:57 Listen. You need to be careful.

14:58:50 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

15:23:47 Don't let them trick you.

15:25:36 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

15:34:24 You should keep your room locked while you sleep.

15:35:37 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki taps her claws on the floor.

15:41:37 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

15:44:42 Don't let them trick you.

15:54:22 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

15:55:01 Remember what I said.

15:55:11 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

16:06:07 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

16:09:37 A Tardick lizard named Thor blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:12:13 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Luja."

16:12:20 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Luja."

16:22:07 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly east.

16:25:02 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

16:35:35 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

16:46:09 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

16:56:37 You hear something fall in the next room.

16:56:49 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

16:56:59 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

17:26:50 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

17:37:08 The group of tetras zooms around the bowl in tight circles.

17:47:47 Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.

17:58:09 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

17:58:19 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

18:10:46 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

18:28:09 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

18:33:30 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

18:43:54 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

18:54:00 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

18:59:08 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

18:59:18 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

19:24:08 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

19:34:19 There is a momentary pause from the gunfire and then the shooting resumes.

19:44:30 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

19:46:53 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

19:57:33 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

19:59:45 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

19:59:56 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

20:09:11 Thuds echo throughout the ship as micrometeorites slam into the hull.

20:29:46 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

20:32:15 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

20:42:25 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

20:53:01 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

20:57:12 The ship's reactionless drive whirrs loudly as it changes direction rapidly.

21:00:56 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

21:01:06 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

21:05:18 The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

21:05:18 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

21:06:05 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else coming out?"

21:06:16 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm in engineering."

21:06:29 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok, I'll be outside."

21:18:03 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:18:13 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:18:13 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:18:23 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

21:46:29 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

21:52:55 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:53:05 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:53:05 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:53:15 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

21:57:55 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

22:23:05 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

22:33:39 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

22:43:50 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

22:53:58 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

22:54:07 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

22:54:18 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

23:09:43 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

23:24:08 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

23:34:18 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

23:44:30 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.

23:46:26 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

23:54:43 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

23:54:53 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
