The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa cover

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

23:16 Please be aware of the following basic guidelines for battlecruiser ownership:

* You must demonstrate the maturity to handle the ownership of such an advanced piece of technology. Monitors listen to the communicators and if you say that you are in league with the Praelor, are a child of a Praelor, have given birth to a Praelor, or otherwise have allegiances that conflict with those of the High Guard or your alliance, you will have your battlecruiser license revoked. Please note that this includes "renouncing" your alliance or the High Guard.

* You must use your battlecruiser in the defense of human space against targets the High Guard has deemed threatening, such as Praelor or rogue human pilots.

* Your battlecruiser rights will be revoked should you attack sectors 24 (High Guard Command) or 12 (Bellerophon), in any way, shape, or form. While the space station and Rolukssica base are equipped with defenses to deal with proximity weapons, blockades, and known enemy vessels, it is NOT there to clean up after irresponsible pilots. If you are found attempting to circumvent ANY defenses in High Guard space, your battlecruiser license will be revoked and may not be restored.

* Any action contrary to the goals of the High Guard, such as preventing combat missions, blockading the space station, blockading the mission jump gate, or otherwise interfering with High Guard operations is justification for the removal of these rights.

These are extremely basic guidelines. We will not attempt to spell out every specific situation, as it's your responsibility to make good decisions and judgement calls. By sending this application in, you are agreeing that your right to the battlecruiser class starship is at the sole discression of the joint committee for the regulation of advanced human war technoligies and may be revoked at any time for violating the above guidelines or in any situation the committee deems worthy of removal of these rights.

For more information on the battlecruiser testing process, please refer to message board post 13665.
