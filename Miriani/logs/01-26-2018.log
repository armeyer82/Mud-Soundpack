The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

02:18 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She has a green stamp of an oakleaf insignia on her left hand. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a skimpy white spaghetti strap linen bandeaux top which has a keyhole neck and has tiny white daisies on the front. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of white capris over a violet silk g-string embroidered with tiny red roses. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi-colored ston
02:18 es, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink armor storage bag, a pink stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity pink Lore computer, a deep purple leather briefcase, a violet rolled toolkit, a purple diving gear bag, a small handheld radio receiver, a sleek hot pink repair kit, an asteroid hauling kit, a multi-strand of iridescent strawberry pearls, a seashell pink friendship bracelet with kitten-shaped beads, a silver ring with an amethyst gemstone, an amethyst crystal butterfly, a diamond Commoveo membership ring, a violet spacesuit jet, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a bright pink snuggly holding an orange and white cat, and a small handheld mineral scanner.
She is carrying nothing.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a v
