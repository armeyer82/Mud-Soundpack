What we failed to mention in our original post are the following two things:

* When submitting gift requests, please, please, please spell check your item. Similarly, grammar check it as well. This means don't use IT'S when you mean ITS. ITS is the possessive form of the word, meaning that the property belongs to the item. IT'S is what you want to use when you're trying to say IT IS. Same rule for WHOSE versus WHO'S. WHOSE is it belongs to who, where WHO'S means WHO IS.
* Don't capitalize item names unless they begin with a proper noun. This isn't as much of a big deal when submitting a normal letter, as we have to hand-make the item already. However, it makes it a big pain in the ornaments when it's done in the labs. We have a lot of requests to fill, so do your part and make it a little easier on us.

Failure to comply with the rules will result in the immediate rejection of your request and you will need to fix any issues and resubmit.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
