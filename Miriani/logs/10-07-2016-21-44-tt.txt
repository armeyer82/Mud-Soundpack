Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's
nothing but vacuum all around.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced
with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and
the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. A thick band that stretches across
all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown
rattan table with a glass top, an interdictor launcher, Nestor the humanoid
service robot, a cardboard box labeled 'Here be keys', an orange plastic box
labeled 'Felo Chow', a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile
and thick gold fringe, a metal container, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding
trough, a small natural golden brown trash bin, and Magellan the arachnoid
security robot here.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec is sitting on a dark brown
leather captain's chair. Lily Kaise is dozing on a blue velvet sectional sofa.
Rogue Romano is dozing on a soft square dark blue rug. Klaus Stein and Kim
Saunders are sitting on a blue velvet sectional sofa. Luja Garland is sitting
comfortably cross legged on a rug.
You can go south, up, and out.

close."

The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "For this, we are estimating based on the NBD pings."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Ohh."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Signal strength is currently at 34%."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "When we were at aquarium, they were at 41%."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "And we're so-and-so direction from the
NDB."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Ahh."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, those signals do not help with direction directly."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Oh."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "We may reach 41% and not be there."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "It happened on way in, we were too high."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "That's really smart."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "You may see the Torus as a sphere in this."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "A slice of that sphere is in the 41% range."
Luja Garland nods.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Direction doesn't factor in at all,
just our distance from the center. Right?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Yup."
A self satisfied smile spreads across Luja's face.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "A teleporting storm could have technically brought us at same distance
from Torus on opposite side."

The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "We would not immediately know that, but keep on our current direction
would weaker the signal, which would be a strong clue."
Luja's smile quickly falters.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Since signal is getting stronger, we know we are going in right
direction, notably closer to it."
Luja Garland exclaims in a Filipino accent, "Ahh, that signal is really useful!"
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Do you need special equipment to pick
it up?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Quite so."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "But exploration is all about those thirty or more addons."
Luja sucks in air through her teeth.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Sounds expensive."
An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of
machine-gun fire.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, yes."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Don't need everything from the start, though."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Or you can just go with the rich people."
Luja Garland grins.

The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Can't wait 'til I've enough points for
a rift drive."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Is a fine drive."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Will bring you places."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Hopefully won't get lost and have to
self destruct, too."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That is very unlikely, we have
pretty good navigators on board."
Luja Garland laughs.
Luja quickly adds, "I meant when the day comes where I fly around on my own,
haha!"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Boom."
An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left
leg is soaked in blood.

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Be excited, Luja."
Luja tilts her head curiously.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "What's going to happen?"
'Adventure.
You say, "Adventure."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I dunno, Akemi cleaned up alien ship. Maybe that will help with."
Luja Garland exclaims in a Filipino accent, "Ahh, right! She mentioned that
earlier today. I thought she meant the aquarium. Didn't know we were docked next
to another alien ship!"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Yes, it has been there for a while, ever still."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I know, it looks more like,
something else than a ship."

it look like?"

Samantha the old large violet felo jumps down from Lily Kaise's lap.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, alien, hmm, well when we get
there again, now you know there is a ship parked there, you might recognize
seeing it."
An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the
fog.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "It is a tiny mobile giant aquarium."
Luja's eyes widen.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "That's really cool and strange."
The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct
hits.
Kim Saunders scrambles to her feet.
Kim Saunders strolls south.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Is a starship filled with water, really."
Samantha the old large violet felo stares up at Luja Garland for a moment, then
says, "Mrr" and wanders away.
Kim Saunders strolls in from the south.
Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Kim Saunders strolls south.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Probably created by creatprs of aquarium, who are still rather
unknown."
Luja holds her hand up and shakes her head.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Hold on. Is Aquarium an official name?"
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Or a class of ship?"
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Or is it an apt nickname only?"
Kim Saunders strolls in from the south.
Kim Saunders sits down on a blue velvet sectional sofa.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well."
Kim Saunders retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot
chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into her mouth.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "You could call it a derelict structure."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Neither is all that useful."
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Akemi Bando shakily walks in from the south.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "They did not leave name plate behind."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Oh, we're getting close now."
Luja Garland smiles at Akemi Bando.
Luja says to Akemi, "Hey, Akemi."
Akemi says to Pierre-Louis, "Name plate?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "All hail to the Akemi."
"Are you ok?" Kim Saunders smiles at Akemi Bando.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "The aquarium aliens did not leave proper nameplate."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Am I okay? I'm no worse than I
was before I slept."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "I thought the Aquarium was the name of
a tourist attraction. With water slides. Even bought a one-piece for the water
slides."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I will see what I can do about having aquatic alien theme park built."
Luja Garland smirks at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, it could be done."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Pool will use that very same slimy water."
An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left
leg is soaked in blood.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Neat! But do we have to wear space
suits for the theme park?"
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in
from the airlock.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "That seems boring."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Whole thing will be clothing optional."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Yes."
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "I mean, if you're using the same water.
Does the water make you sick?"
Luja clarifies, "The slimy water, that is."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, not the exact same water, it will just have same level if
viscosity."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Oh. Ohh, for historical accuracy."
Luja nods approvingly.
Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and
advance into the fray.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.
Luja taps her chin.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I suspect we might be a bit too low due to drift."
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
south.
locate
You are receiving no signal from the NDB at Helios Station.
You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem somewhat faint. The signal strength meter reads: 35%.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Nevertheless, future flow will make going more up at the end easy."
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Mister Bando, request a transmission from our advance Reach post,
perhaps 65% at 30 0."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Aye aye, Captain."
Akemi Bando shakily walks south.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "That's an H9."
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The message will take
a couple of subcycles to finish sending."
Akemi Bando shakily walks in from the south.
Akemi Bando takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.
pet shasta
You stroke the soft fur of Shasta the big onyx soldier felo.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand,
looking up at you adoringly.
Pierre-Louis says to Akemi Bando, "Hope you will make full recovery from your
rift battling."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "It's just tinnitus. People get
it from listening to music too loud, never mind from having a quarrel with some
rift thing."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo stares curiously up at Klaus Stein.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Thank you for the well wishes,
though."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
Kim Saunders smiles at Akemi Bando. "I also hope they can cure it properly at
home."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "We can check the fish bowl before we charge at the station if you are
very excited about checking it out."
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Fish bowl? Is that the aquarium?"
Akemi Bando nods.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo stares curiously up at Akemi Bando.
Akemi Bando strokes the soft fur of Shasta the big onyx soldier felo.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo purrs softly.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "We've to check out the little ship
docked there, too."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Aye, aye."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches out.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I've been thinking about being stuck in rift."
Kim Saunders takes a bite of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a small
bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.
Luja tilts her head curiously at Pierre-Louis.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Stuck in the rift? How'd you do that?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Using unsafe ship that goes too deep, or exiting ship while it is
rifting."
Luja Garland blinks.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Whoa. Is that even possible?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, it did happens."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "You can also get dragged into
the rift if you are outside when the ship enters."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "And there is always finding
natural tears in the rift between our space and it."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Goddamn."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "The rescue team for Peter used a
natural tear."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "The clan lady told tales of slicing things with her sword, but Jimothy
seemed pretty relaxed in there."
eta
The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "That's insane."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Local rift seems to adapt to midnset of occupant, but I do not know to
what point."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Valeriya said that Hana's sword
had a surprising amount of damage to it. Needed maintenance when we brought her
to Dolia."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Stop blowing my mind, I don't want to
get desensitized to amazing things."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Yes, but none of the other people we know were in rift spoke of
anything violent."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "None went so far though. Jimothy
was in for a week. Peter was in for years, but he had protection after he met
Euclid."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Hana had herself, and was in for
months."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "She was found a thousand
lightyears or more from where she was lost."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "A week?"
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "Wasn't it a week?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Not sure, there was an headline about it."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I thought it was in the three digits of cycles, though."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Holy cow."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "We'll look it up when we get
home. Or ask someone to look it up for us."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Ask on the QE."
Kim Saunders takes a sip of a cup of hot red rooibos tea.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Is not very urgent."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "We'll have the hypercaster on
the Aquarium's QE soon."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Much easier to get people to do
things with that, than the QE."
Luja Garland grins.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, we too have been noticing an
increase in violent activity from rift entities lately, or maybe it is just a
coincidence."
A hairy black and red striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Araignée skitters
into the area.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I would be ready to bet that rest of the rift cutter crew, the non
warrior ones, will have experienced no such violent encounters, though."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Let's hope they are found, then they
can tell us."
Kim Saunders takes several bites of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a
small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "There has been many signs that the rift can change depending on will of
occupants, though at what point is mysterious."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches south.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "There are signs the rift just
does what it wants, too."
A hairy black and red striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Araignée jerks his
limbs, springing into the air briefly.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "I think the rift itself, the
medium we travel through, is somewhat responsive. The "hallucination" part."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "There are other things that live
in the rift through, or use it like we do, and they have their own motives."
Luja Garland gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Yes, perhaps some of them are even aliens or such that got subsumed by
rift."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Perhaps some were created by will of others."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "So far we haven't found any
other species that are alive and using rift ships."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "A couple of dead ones though."
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "What! We've found corpses in the rift?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "We did get warning from future that opening natural rift portal would
doom humanity."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "No, not corpses. I refer to
evidence that the Glyphmaker aliens and the Aquarium aliens used the rift for
their ships too."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Is quite possible all those lost races all died out because they played
with rift too much."
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in
from the south.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.
Luja's eyes widen.
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "How many alien ships have we found?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Well, depends on what you mean."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, not many starships,. More structures."
Akemi Bando nods.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Strucutures and their defending robots."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Ohh."
Kim Saunders retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of
the bowl and slurps them up.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Not entirely what evidence there is about glyphmakers using riuft
drive, though. That sail extender blueprint?"
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Yes, that, and things like the
proximal beacon locator."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Tools you don't need unless you

as ours."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "The beacon locator seems a bit of a sketch still."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I do still plan to find more of their ruins when time is right, perhaps
better evidence will be found."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Maybe we will find a Glyphmaker
ship that is not a defense drone."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo suddenly jumps onto a blue velvet sectional
sofa.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "I suspect the station drones
like to take apart anything they can find and use it to build more drones."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "No debris around Glyphmaker
stations, ever."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Maybe a nearly dead station
would be a good bet."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Just alive enough to send the
signal that it should not be dismantled by its neighbors."
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Have I seen these glyphmaker stations
without knowing what it was?"
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches up.

Grave."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Indeed, that makes you an alien."
Luja's breathing quickens. "Awesome."
Akemi says to Luja, "They made zero-point energy sources which are easy to adapt
to our own designs."
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "How can you tell?"
Luja Garland exclaims in a Filipino accent, "Ohh!"
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "We had zero-point energy
generation technology of our own, once, but it was lost in the Subjugation."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "I have a rock that is a zero energy generation device."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Now there's only a couple of
companies that have any skill with the technology."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "The most reliable human version
of the technology can only make a tiny trickle charge. It is used in very
expensive flashlights."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Whoa."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "The Glyphmaker version is much
superior, even if it is somewhat fragile."
Akemi Bando removes a small pocket zero-point energy flashlight in a metallic
black casing from a small black leather zip pouch.

Nouveau Quebec's lap and settles in, purring.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "That looks really neat."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "A standard flashlight is just as
useful in most cases. I just like having a light I don't have to worry about
running down the battery on."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "What does it cost? Compared to a normal
flashlight, that is."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Like 12,000 AEU credits I think?
Very expensive for a flashlight."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Nothing much for a pilot's
budget, of course."
Luja Garland grins.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "The best way to have good light is to use services of Stavros to have
bright things attached to you."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Standard flashlights are like, 6
credits."
Akemi says to Pierre-Louis, "I have had enough of glowing for awhile."
Luja says to Akemi, "Yeah, how'd that happen?"

A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
Luja's eyes widen.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Yeah. Joel."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Well, you know how they like to
light things on fire then."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "We met one that, instead of
lighting us on fire, did something to make mineral deposits form in us."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Whoa."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "The mineral deposits, the
medical term for them is calculi, they were energized by the snowflake that
visited us, and they glowed with that energy."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "I heard something about quarantine,
too."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "That wasn't necessary,
considering the condition wasn't contagious."

correct?"
Luja Garland says, OOCly, "That's me."

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says into the PA microphone,
"That can't be the problem, transmission was perfectly clear at station at 61%."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "That was a very well aimed
beam."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Also are you sure? We were using
more like 70% most of the time we were there."

telling me we need to go very up."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "But then maybe we need to go down, or sideway."

the location of its center?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Well, aquarium is special in you can see energetic bee going to it."

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

going."
Luja perks up and slowly turns her head to Pierre-Louis.

mincycles more."

A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.

accent, "Sure, those tamer storms might allow you go move faster for a bit."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

that dangerous. Strange storm, at least artificial one also break the drift fast
but might also displace you quickly over rather long distances."

Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Rift storms seem to be on size
scale of nebula."

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Anyway, self-destruct is done by launching hull-attached charges, can
only do it while not moving thus."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "That's more a safety interlock
than a real constraint."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Probably."
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Oh."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Well, hopefully we won't find out the hard
way."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

Luja Garland snickers.
Soraya Rhyz cuddles up to Keegan Wantz.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Save us, rift cat."
Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a New Earth accent, "Watch that
tail of yours."
Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Been a while since I self-destructed a ship, I vaguely remember it
starting with ship launching the charges into space and then they come back. In
that case charges would not reach ship if you moved away."
Keegan Wantz glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.
Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Keegan would know how it works better, though."
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Soraya Rhyz looks at Keegan Wantz thoughtfully.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Charges go out, charges come in,
explosions."
Soraya Rhyz nods.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Very enlightening."
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders up.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Lily usually let them float entirely drained of power where they will
never be found, mixed with other dead space rocks."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Many exciting ways to go about it."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "I have never self destructed an
exploration vessel."
Keegan Wantz beams.
Akemi says to Keegan, "Liar."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Except for."
Akemi says to Keegan, "Void Piercers are exploration ships."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "My Void Piercer."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Which isn't a real exploration
ship."
Keegan Wantz glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.
Luja says to Keegan, "What happened?"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "So, fun story."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "If your starship has no guns
whatsoever."
Soraya says to Keegan, "I'm proud of you."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "And a wee bitty Qi clan fighter
interdicts you."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Your ship is scrap."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "So instead of letting it pew pew me
to death with its bitty chainguns."
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "Did you offer a big enough
bribe?"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "I just self destructed."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "They didn't respond."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "Well what did you open with?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "If void piercer is not exploration ship, what is role of it?"
Luja Garland looks at Keegan Wantz and winces.
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Good Day, Almost Barbaric Clan of
Qi Peoples."
Luja says to Keegan, "Ahh, that sounds terrible."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "It was more 'What can I pay you to
leave me alone?'"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "I."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Was not willing to give them the
ship, if they had responded with that."
Keegan Wantz grins.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "Lesser of two evils, sounds like."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "They're good for artifacting."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Keegan's goes very fast."
The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I had a Void Piercer for a long time,
almost two years but sold it. Had hoped to get an AEU Arrow but I can't seem to
please the Government enough to earn one yet."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Best plant."
Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.
Keegan Wantz strides south.
Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.
Keegan Wantz sits down on Soraya Rhyz's lap.
Akemi says to Lily in a strange Japanese accent, "What do you mean "please"
them?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well they don't like my application
responses."
Akemi says to Lily in a strange Japanese accent, "If it's anything like the
application for the science vessel, you just have to show you are going to use
your head when you get into tight spots, and use the ship well when you're going
out."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I know."
Lily Kaise grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The Arrow is a bit tougher though I
think."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "My crown achievement is mighty stealth galleon, I did not manage well
enough to obtain most holy siren battery, though."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I have no problem being approved for
Long-Range Sightseers though."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Shouldn't be. It's a great scout
ship, but it's basically inferior to a standard science vessel."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well could be but what the AEU
Government considers as appropriate might not be the same for League's."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Your government's full of
idiots."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Vote for your favorite idiot, or perhaps Voxel."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Huh well we'll rock forever with what
and how??? who knows and cares if you vote that way."
Soraya Rhyz applauds sedately.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Soothing power of music will be spread all around space."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's not all bad."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We don't have enough music around."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Voxel's just using his political
career as a vehicle to become ever more famous. It's smart marketing, but if he
really cared about AEU governance he would be building a real political party."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's pretty much my take."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Fun to joke about too."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Vote Garner, I want to see his exploration navy and perhaps shoot at it
at some point."
Luja Garland asks in a Filipino accent, "Speaking of music. Does anyone know how
to play a harmonica?"
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Harmonica? I think Joel does."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "He has a real political party."
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Everyone who thinks politics are
annoying."
Keegan Wantz beams.
Soraya Rhyz snuggles up to Keegan Wantz's shoulder.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "They don't let me vote in other alliances.
It's a travesty."
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "I wonder how different the AEU
would be with a dictator?"
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Guess it would depend on the
dictator."
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "Of the current prominent
politicians in AEU politics, who would be the best dictator?"
Keegan Wantz says in an Asuncionite accent, "Our benevolent dictator will take
control of the AEU with an iron fist."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Vote Voxel for dictator."
Luja rubs her eyes until they are red.
Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "I'd ask for details on politics, but
I'm already sleepy."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "The details aren't much, really,
anyway. Pick from different flavors of isolationism, nationalism, or
directionless flounderism."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo jumps into Lily Kaise's lap and settles in,
purring.
Luja taps her chin thoughtfully.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Shasta the big onyx soldier felo.

Luja Garland says in a Filipino accent, "'cause I might fall asleep in the hot

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec presses a button on the rift
drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Anfisa of Marzore's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "13.87
light-trade cycles at a heading of southsoutheast and slightly up."

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown
rattan table with a glass top, an interdictor launcher, Nestor the humanoid
service robot, a cardboard box labeled 'Here be keys', an orange plastic box
labeled 'Felo Chow', a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile
and thick gold fringe, a metal container, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding
trough, a small natural golden brown trash bin, and Magellan the arachnoid
security robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a blue velvet sectional sofa.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a blue velvet sectional sofa.)
Lily Kaise points at a metal container.

drop metal
You put down a metal container.
Lily Kaise activates the ultimate salvage sensor and begins scanning for chunks
of debris.
luminosity
You press a button, and the ship's luminosity sensor performs a quick analysis.
The luminosity sensor's display shows that the local luminosity level is
slightly dim.
The salvage sensor reports detection of a small lumpy rock (grade 90) at a range
of 228000km at Sector Southeast and Down, a small superheated mass (grade 80) at
a range of 216000km at Sector Southeast and Down, a small superheated mass
(grade 80) at a range of 168000km at Sector Southeast and Down, a small
superheated mass (grade 80) at a range of 192000km at Sector Southeast and Down,
a small superheated mass (grade 80) at a range of 192000km at Sector Southeast
and Up, a small lumpy rock (grade 70) at a range of 156000km at Sector South and
Down, and a small superheated mass (grade 80) at a range of 156000km at Sector
Southeast and Up.
'Survey or not?
You ask, "Survey or not?"
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's pretty."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not sure go ahead and ask over the pA."
Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We shouldn't waste a lot of time."

You speak into the microphone.
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No."

You speak into the microphone.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I didn't think so."
'Me neither. Do remember our old heading?
You ask, "Me neither. Do remember our old heading?"
Samantha the old sleeping large violet felo suddenly sneezes, bolting upright.
It blinks, then gradually sinks back to the ground and falls asleep again.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Hmm I think 300 35."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
rift heading 300 35
You quickly turn a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 300.0, 35.0.
rift start
You flip a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then
push a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
Lily Kaise gives you a thumbs up!
Lily Kaise smiles.
Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.
wrap lily
You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
'hang on. I'll post really quick
You say, "Hang on. I'll post really quick."
rift loc
You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
A readout shows Nebular Signature 3930-5605 about 382.88 light-cycles toward
Galactic North and Down.

Samantha the old sleeping large violet felo meows, wriggles a bit, then goes
back to sleep.
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "NDB is 40 now."
Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections
and recent ping returns.
This was spotted after traveling about 3.66 LTC. Luminosity was slightly dimm
and debris was 70 to 90. An image was taken and we resumed our course.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to
possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
A hairy black and purple striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Webster skitters
into the area.

Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and

The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.
Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along
with yours.
A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other,
then places it back on the conveyor belt.

You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new

A chance storm cut our trip time down. We already checked out the station and
old ship. I didn't notice anything much different. Some eggs on the ship had
hatched, mostly ones in the deeper side chambers. The shallow chambers do not
seem to suitable for brood chambers at all. I may re-locate the eggs in those to
the deeper chambers.
I found Lily's eel eggs, but since I don't know how many she left, I can't say
if any are missing (from predation or hatching). We may need to relocate those
too, to the deeper brood chambers in the station.
I reported our findings to home already via the hypercaster, but it is likely
that the Coreward Reach hypercaster was not replaced when it went down. In any
case, we got no reply, neither on the QE comm nor via hypercaster. It is
possible none of the pilots with active communicators cared to reply at all.
Our temporary station has 14 cycles and 24 subcycles of charge. That's about 64
hours. We have plenty of time to wait around if we want. Or to go around and
note what objects are near this place, for future trips.
Our ship will take over 2 cycles to charge, so we'll be on this station for a
bit in any case.

Here's the scoop: We're going to get level with Helios, and then turn directly
for it. We're not exactly sure how far upward we have to travel (it is up
though, not down like I thought originally) but we can check as we go and be
okay. If we go more than like, 50 LTC up and we're still not level, we'll
probably want to just turn for Helios anyway. At that point we'll still have the
range to get there with some safety margin, but it'll be pushing it.
Anfisa checked her chart for us, and gave a distance of 121.63 LTC to Helios
from the derelict station, on heading westsouthwest and very slightly up. The
distance to Helios shouldn't increase too much while we get level with it, so
keep that in mind when we're planning diverions to check out sites of interest.

We stopped of at this system after 6.65 LTC traveled. It was a gas giant-centric
system with slightly greater than Sol level luminosity. Took a picture and found
2 planets before we headed off again.

You can only wonder what's so interesting.
'yep, still smells like squid.
You say, "Yep, still smells like squid."
Kim says to Pierre-Louis, "Oh, you also might like to know I found a bunch of
spider webbing in the shower near the mid quarters. Akemi has it for
safekeeping. It may be nothing since our ArachnoPals t end to spin webbing, but
they usually eat theirs."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Interesting."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward

light was something we saw during spider rift vision."
Aisling an Sionnach says in an unusual Irish accent, "I saw cocoons pass by

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's

The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later,
it emerges again and all is back to normal.

Aisling an Sionnach prances south.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Forward Observation]
A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy
poster of Nouveau Quebec Premier Maxime Roberge giving two thumbs up, a small
cinnamon brown trash bin, a large bubbling royal blue-lit aquarium containing
white round rocks, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a
side table dressed with a fancy white cloth decorated with gold fleur-de-lis, a
black plastic tray of spider chow, a glossy dark violet ceramic felo chow bowl,
a soft square brown floor cushion, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously
deep pile and thick gold fringe, a transparisteel plaque engraved with the
phrase ""Is good to expect nothing." -Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys", a small
orange ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a round saffron orange
zafu with a white strap, and a cute little plush calico cat with brilliant green
eyes here.
Anfisa of Marzore is dozing on a soft square brown floor cushion. Akemi Bando is
dozing on a soft square dark blue rug. Kim Saunders is sitting on an overstuffed

just to diversify the trip a bit."

will likely take several months for it to reproduce eggs and so on. I did check
on the eel eggs I had put down and none had hatched. I relocated them farther
into the aquarium where I would consider they might hatch and thrive moreso. Who
knows but it's sad that there don't seem to be eels there anymore after the
first ones were taken away."

Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
'Space infantry?
You ask, "Space infantry?"
'Hmmm
You say, "Hmmm."
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it
for a moment.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Good the elevation is leveled now."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag
with a pastel kitten on the side, a compact metallic purple camera with a gold
fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery pink camera strap, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named
