Kitty,
Im writing this letter as a last resort. If you truly love me, then I need you to act like it and at least give me the dignity of listening to my side of the story.
Cria and Fawkes have been hunting me ever since I joined the Calaway's organization. Fawkes took it personally that I left without telling him. Around the same time or soon thereafter, Anton fired on my expediter. Not my gunship, but my expediter. I almost lost my expediter several times coming into sector 15 because of all of the automated laser turrets that were frequently being put there. This is why I started flying around in a gunship as the gunship was able to withstand the laser fire and get me safely to Empanda. Maybe you disagree with the fact that I was flying around in a gunship, but that is why. I at least need you to understand.
If I am truly a coward, then why did people not call me that after I left with you and the Calaway's to go get their gunship? It was clearly my ship and we left out of sector 5. This happened after I was already being hunted by Cria and Fawkes. The next time I left to go out of locals was last month when I left out of sector 37. Remembering what you told me about the transverser not being a very good combat ship should we run into Praelor in deep space, I followed what you taught me by taking my gunship which I had upgraded for exploration. I left out of sector 37 intending to go to Celestia located Northwest and up from sector 37. I brought my tranny since I had no other ship that had medical facilities if Miriam and I had been injured in any way. I docked it in the gunship so that if we ran into Praelor on the way to Celestia, I could solo the gunship easier if need be. I also docked my fighter as a back up plan.
So no, I was not just transporting my tranny over to Miriam's place. I was trying to go to Celestia so that I could do some atmospheric salvaging there and had brought my tranny and fighter for the reasons above. The first time I attempted to leave, Cria and Fawkes showed up in their battle cruiser and heliogaster respectively. I asked for assistance and so did Miriam as she was with me. Ryan eventually showed up in his BC and by coordinating with us, we managed to jump out. 
I attempted it again a few days later and Cria chased me out of sector 37 again. This time, we saw him coming and jumped out before he got to us to another sector. The third time is when my gunship was blown up and I temporarily lost my tranny.
To those who call me a coward, it is important to choose your battles and to them I ask, "Who is the real coward?" Is it me with the least experience, or the ones with years experience fighting other pilots and purposefully out numbering the less experienced pilot? I would say it is the latter. It takes no courage whatsoever to fight an adversary that you know you have out gunned, and out numbered. That's truly a coward's act in my book. It takes more courage, maturity and more humility to talk with people instead of just throwing fists, so to speak.
So I don't care who calls me a coward. They should look at themselves first. You invited me out of locals soon after we broke up which would have probably coincided with the time I ended up leaving. Would I have been a coward then? I refuse to live my life in locals, because blood thirsty warmongers want me to. I joined the pilot corps to explore deep space, not to follow the whim, wants, desires, and irrational behavior of those who can't use words to negotiate and would rather just slug it out in a back alley. It's not my style and I refuse to bow down to that.
So, if you truly love me, and since you're obviously in contact with those people hunting me. You can pass on my message. Seems like you'd rather kiss their butts instead of give me the least bit of consideration or the benefit of the doubt.
If the roles were reversed, I would do what ever it took to defend you if I truly loved you. I would give anything to protect you and uphold your dignity and pride. I would give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to your side completely before making any judgements. You have done none of this. Cria and Fawkes and the people who call me cowards refuse to use this thing called words to negotiate with me. They tell you instead of telling me and what do you tell them? You agree wit
22:46 h them, right? You question what I did without even knowing all of the facts. You assume that I'm just this little doggy that Miriam has wrapped around her little finger. Well, think twice. If you really think that, then you obviously didn't know me very well.
After you found out that my gunship got blown up, you immediately began to reprimand me. You barely offered any sympathy or gave me a chance to explain myself. So you know what? I don't feel the love tonight. You can tell me all you want, but you need to show me. Not just tell me.

Maybe you disagree with the fact that I was flying around in a gunship, but that is why. I at least need you to understand.
If I am truly a coward, then why did people not call me that after I left with you and the Calaway's to go get their gunship? It was clearly my ship and we left out of sector 5. This happened after I was already being hunted by Cria and Fawkes. The next time I left to go out of locals was last month when I left out of sector 37. Remembering what you told me about the transverser not being a very good combat ship should we run into Praelor in deep space, I followed what you taught me by taking my gunship which I had upgraded for exploration. I left out of sector 37 intending to go to Celestia located Northwest and up from sector 37. I brought my tranny since I had no other ship that had medical facilities if Miriam and I had been injured in any way. I docked it in the gunship so that if we ran into Praelor on the way to Celestia, I could solo the gunship easier if need be. I also docked my fighter as a back up plan.
So no, I was not just transporting my tranny over to Miriam's place. I was trying to go to Celestia so that I could do some atmospheric salvaging there and had brought my tranny and fighter for the reasons above. The first time I attempted to leave, Cria and Fawkes showed up in their battle cruiser and heliogaster respectively. I asked for assistance and so did Miriam as she was with me. Ryan eventually showed up in his BC and by coordinating with us, we managed to jump out. 
I attempted it again a few days later and Cria chased me out of sector 37 again. This time, we saw him coming and jumped out before he got to us to another sector. The third time is when my gunship was blown up and I temporarily lost my tranny.
To those who call me a coward, it is important to choose your battles and to them I ask, "Who is the real coward?" Is it me with the least experience, or the ones with years experience fighting other pilots and purposefully out numbering the less experienced pilot? I would say it is the latter. It takes no courage whatsoever to fight an adversary that you know you have out gunned, and out numbered. That's truly a coward's act in my book. It takes more courage, maturity and more humility to talk with people instead of just throwing fists, so to speak.
So I don't care who calls me a coward. They should look at themselves first. You invited me out of locals soon after we broke up which would have probably coincided with the time I ended up leaving. Would I have been a coward then? I refuse to live my life in locals, because blood thirsty warmongers want me to. I joined the pilot corps to explore deep space, not to follow the whim, wants, desires, and irrational behavior of those who can't use words to negotiate and would rather just slug it out in a back alley. It's not my style and I refuse to bow down to that.
So, if you truly love me, and since you're obviously in contact with those people hunting me. You can pass on my message. Seems like you'd rather kiss their butts instead of give me the least bit of consideration or the benefit of the doubt.
If the roles were reversed, I would do what ever it took to defend you if I truly loved you. I would give anything to protect you and uphold your dignity and pride. I would give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to your side completely before making any judgements. You have done none of this. Cria and Fawkes and the people who call me cowards refuse to use this thing called words to negotiate with me. They tell you instead of telling me and what do you tell them? You agree wit
22:47 h them, right? You question what I did without even knowing all of the facts. You assume that I'm just this little doggy that Miriam has wrapped around her little finger. Well, think twice. If you really think that, then you obviously didn't know me very well.
After you found out that my gunship got blown up, you immediately began to reprimand me. You barely offered any sympathy or gave me a chance to explain myself. So you know what? I don't feel the love tonight. You can tell me all you want, but you need to show me. Not just tell me.

Kitty,
Im writing this letter as a last resort. If you truly love me, then I need you to act like it and at least give me the dignity of listening to my side of the story.
Cria and Fawkes have been hunting me ever since I joined the Calaway's organization. Fawkes took it personally that I left without telling him. Around the same time or soon thereafter, Anton fired on my expediter. Not my gunship, but my expediter. I almost lost my expediter several times coming into sector 15 because of all of the automated laser turrets that were frequently being put there. This is why I started flying around in a gunship as the gunship was able to withstand the laser fire and get me safely to Empanda. Maybe you disagree with the fact that I was flying around in a gunship, but that is why. I at least need you to understand.
