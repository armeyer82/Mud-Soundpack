12:38 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, and a roll of red wrapping paper patterned with stars here.

12:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:39 You must stand up first.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

13:40 ["Pandia" Weapons Room 6] (indoors) (sitting on a plush royal blue velvet crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. You see a glowing picture frame containing a picture of a cylindrical spaceport floating through a mostly deserted sector hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. You see a glowing picture frame containing a picture of a cylindrical spaceport floating through a mostly deserted sector hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. You see a glowing picture frame containing a picture of a cylindrical spaceport floating through a mostly deserted sector hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.

Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. You see a glowing picture frame containing a picture of a cylindrical spaceport floating through a mostly deserted sector hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. You see a glowing picture frame containing a picture of a cylindrical spaceport floating through a mostly deserted sector hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret and a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid tucked discretely in a corner. You also see a plush royal blue velvet crew chair facing the weapons console here.

Her glossy golden and curly hair enhances her face with its elfin features and alluringly dances about her shoulders. The slitted smaragd green eyes of this figure are framed by thick, golden eyelashes, accentuated by perfectly arched eyebrows. Her snub nose, her smiling mouth, dimples on her chin and her pointed ears give her a somewhat sly appearance. She has tiny, translucent wings which are folded on her back. Her limbs are thin but muscular. A long, flowing dress made of colorful flower petals cascades down to the toecaps of her knee-high, black suede boots. On her head, she is wearing a red cloth tied to make a hat, and around her neck clings a necklace with a heart-shaped tag bearing the name "Cookie." She is holding a golden tray patterned with stars in her hands.
