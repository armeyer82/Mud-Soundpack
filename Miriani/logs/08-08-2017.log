00:02 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty to Tibo - 8-6-2363]

My Dearest Love,
First off, I haven't had a link with Fawkes in literally months.
As for Cria, I rarely have spoken with him with the very rare
chance that I am on HiGuard for a mission. This has been probably
a couple of months ago. So do not! accuse me of kissing anybody's
butt Tibo. I just try to get along with them by not being caustic
or hostile and sometimes just plain old avoidance is what you have
to do. I truly don't think though that I am safe around any of
them and I'm sure they will likely try to take advantage of me when
they have the opportunity to do so. I don't know why too you would
even imply that i bother to pay anyone to cause you any harm. I
don't work that way and especially towards someone i love as much
as i love you. The only time I will go aggressive towards anyone
is when they have first attacked me. Even then, I generally just
move on as it's not worth the aggrevation until I find that
individual when they least expect it and return by breaking their
bones! Then I owe them absolutely nothing and being nice isn't my
plan! Otherwise, as you know, I'd rather make love than war as I
so want to make love with you.
I will tell you though that you have a bit of manning up to do and
I know you don't like it but still, when others see one flying
around in a gunship, their assumption is and always will be that
they are wanting to fight or at least are able to defend their
starship. Believe me if you want to but I have had enough years of
having my bones broken, ships stolen, attempts at extortion and
blown up ships to decide that I am not going to be a prisoner in my
ship, etc unless I have other reasons for not coming out. When I
am able to work, I go about my business and I face the consequences
of whatever is in my path. I am not the combat pilot I used to be
so I know I can't defend a gunship as I once could so guess what, I
choose not to fly a ship around which costs a few billion credits.
That makes no sense! I'd rather lose one which I have 100
million invested in which is more expendable as it is a hostile
Universe out there and is not likely to ever change. So your
stating you got shot at in your Expediter comes across as whining.
Hey you sure have a short memory when it comes to things.
remember one of my own Expediters launched right into a mine field.
That same Expediter was shot at several times but did it stop me
when I was more active? I was just angry concerning how very new
pilots who only had a few credits earned were in the line of fire.
I just would either accept my loss and go buy another one or use
one I have in reserve as I keep a few. I can tell you lots of
stories of being entrapped and other things but it's no reason to
blame the universe for all of my problems. People respect you
moreso when you at least try to look at your own actions and decide
to just keep doing what you do and to accept the consequences or
use a different strategy. This is probably why you have been
called a coward and no I didn't hear this from Cria or Fawkes
because I absolutely do not communicate with them privately. Nope.
So love, I don't think you deserve any sympathy over your losses
based upon poor judgement. Nobody has given me any except to
perhaps offer to sell me another ship which I may or may have not
accepted. I am sorry for your losses but not still for what I
consider chosing the wrong time of day to go out of locals. Still,
rather than hold yourself accountable all I heard in your letter
was blame this one and blame that one and nothing about hey what
could have i done to evade them or to choose a time to depart or to
not let anyone know when I was leaving/ You know I never tell
anybody what my plans are either and I I showed you measures which
I hope you observed en route. There are pilots whose sport is to
challenge anyone who will to combat. Although it is inconvenient
to us, that's their sport and when you take it personally, this
just feeds their egos. Haven't you heard Anton challenging others
before? For him, it's fun and although you don't see it that way
and I find it to be a royal pain in the butt, that is how it is.
so i certainly understand wanting to take a stronger ship into
Sector 12 if there is an Invasion but there is also the ITPN
particularly when there is that much hostile activity in the
sector. A good practice too is that BCs should actually be taken
to Jump Hub or another neutral location as well to crew but isn't
always done. So don't point fingers at me! I'm trying to relate
some practical survival advice to you yet you always seem to resent
it when someone like myself has had a bit of life and survival
experience and your not wanting to accept and to listen will not
help you much. only you can decide that perhaps there are others
who do know something based upon real experience.
As for the exact circumstances of your lost gunship, still, you
need to step back and get off of the defensive and accept it that
you indeed made tactical errors. That if others such as myself
consider how you mis-managed things don't agree with you, then that
is how it is. It does not mean that I love you any less. However,
I'm not very impressed with the logic behind what you have done at
times. You have lost two gunships in less than a half a year. I
sympathize with the loss of your droids as that was just a mean-
spirited thing on the part of that jerk.
As I have told you before, going to a commonly hunted ground out of
37 is not wise. If you do so, then you need to be willing to take
on the adversities. It is unfortunate but it is just a reality of
being a pilot in this universe. Nobody promised us that we would
live a perfect life here without any challenges.
As for going out of locals, you know I don't do that to run away
but because i enjoy it. still, others perception of you is when
you are angry or upset, that is what you do. As it's typical of
others who are newer pilots and don't engage in pilot versus pilot
combat. I'm not saying you should, just what is the perception
right or wrong.
You know exactly why I choose to go where nobody else goes to
Aquatic, Atmo and Gas salvage. Although it would be fun to be in a
community setting, it's just asking to be attacked so why put
yourself in that position? It's like here I am boys and girls!
come get me! That makes no sense at all! However, if you can
defend your ship and resources, then go where you want to go and be
ready to fight if you have to.
You need to remind yourself exactly why I wanted to take you out of
Locals as it was to enjoy some quality time with you and to not
have any interference so that we could make an attempt to work out
our differences.
Since I had so little quality time withyou until you ran off with
that self-serving individual who yes, how hypocritical, is not
available as much as i was and am. You said she was right by your
side heh well after what 4 days she hasn't been right there by your
side? So a very unfounded justification to hold over my head. I
might have been away for a day or so but I always came right back
to be right there with you. On many occasions, I would be
available for you and wait for at least an hour or two for you to
come home and then it seemed convenient that you wanted me to
become more intimate when you well knew I would sleep soon. It
makes me wonder if it's you who didn't want to take the time to
become more intimate. Still Love, I'd truly like to know what it
would be like to make love with you.
As for supporting you and upholding your dignity, then you will
always have every ounce of my very being to support you if I truly
know that you are using your head and reasonable judgement. Then
you are dignified and deserve to be respected. If you were still
here so I could be by your side, yes I would fight for you but I
nor anyone can't fight battles over circumstances that you created.
You know that I was not in favor of your joining Insanity but you
did so without even discussing it and I suppose had you done so
and I opposed it, that you would have just stomped out angrily,
slammed the door and then perhaps I could just say 'I told you so'.
You know I was initially tempted to join but thought better of it
as I knew that all they would want to do would be to exploit me.
That is one thing that Matt never did to me nor anyone in Force.
He didn't like families and cliques either although couples were
ok. He had some very sound ideas and he did not exploit anyone but
one thing about Matt which was of utmost importance is loyalty. I
did not get the sense that Cria or Fawkes cared anything about
loyalty which is another reason I did not choose to join. I will
likely remain as a member of Force until it is gone or if Matt
comes back and a group of great pilots and a few pirates band
together once again.
So sorry my sweet love, love is tough at times and it should be
because if I continuously supported certain aspects, then how do
you consider this to help you out? It is what they call enabling.
That is not support. Still, if Ihappened to be flying with you and
you were under attack, I wouldn't just sit back and let it happen
to you. If you are implying that I can do anything about Cria and
Fawkes, well sorry Love, I'm in no better circumstances than you.
I know that ifever i let my guard down, they will find a way to
take advantage. When they do though, I will either find a means to
retaliate which is highly unlikely or accept the consequences and
reflect and consider what I should do and defintiely should do
different to prevent a reoccurance of the same circumstances. I
may not succeed but there is nobody to blame but myself for
creating a situation for myself which left me vulnerable. I
wouldn't blame you as you are so hurtfully are blaming me for your
problems. I am accountable to Kitty and if someone loves her and
is available to help her then she is forever grateful. If they
aren't or choose not to, then I don't hold it against them.
You have a

My Dearest Love,
First off, I haven't had a link with Fawkes in literally months.
As for Cria, I rarely have spoken with him with the very rare
chance that I am on HiGuard for a mission. This has been probably
a couple of months ago. So do not! accuse me of kissing anybody's
butt Tibo. I just try to get along with them by not being caustic
or hostile and sometimes just plain old avoidance is what you have
to do. I truly don't think though that I am safe around any of
them and I'm sure they will likely try to take advantage of me when
they have the opportunity to do so. I don't know why too you would
even imply that i bother to pay anyone to cause you any harm. I
don't work that way and especially towards someone i love as much
as i love you. The only time I will go aggressive towards anyone
is when they have first attacked me. Even then, I generally just
move on as it's not worth the aggrevation until I find that
individual when they least expect it and return by breaking their
bones! Then I owe them absolutely nothing and being nice isn't my
plan! Otherwise, as you know, I'd rather make love than war as I
so want to make love with you.
I will tell you though that you have a bit of manning up to do and
I know you don't like it but still, when others see one flying
around in a gunship, their assumption is and always will be that
they are wanting to fight or at least are able to defend their
starship. Believe me if you want to but I have had enough years of
having my bones broken, ships stolen, attempts at extortion and
blown up ships to decide that I am not going to be a prisoner in my
ship, etc unless I have other reasons for not coming out. When I
am able to work, I go about my business and I face the consequences
of whatever is in my path. I am not the combat pilot I used to be
so I know I can't defend a gunship as I once could so guess what, I
choose not to fly a ship around which costs a few billion credits.
That makes no sense! I'd rather lose one which I have 100
million invested in which is more expendable as it is a hostile
Universe out there and is not likely to ever change. So your
stating you got shot at in your Expediter comes across as whining.
Hey you sure have a short memory when it comes to things.
remember one of my own Expediters launched right into a mine field.
That same Expediter was shot at several times but did it stop me
when I was more active? I was just angry concerning how very new
pilots who only had a few credits earned were in the line of fire.
I just would either accept my loss and go buy another one or use
one I have in reserve as I keep a few. I can tell you lots of
stories of being entrapped and other things but it's no reason to
blame the universe for all of my problems. People respect you
moreso when you at least try to look at your own actions and decide
to just keep doing what you do and to accept the consequences or
use a different strategy. This is probably why you have been
called a coward and no I didn't hear this from Cria or Fawkes
because I absolutely do not communicate with them privately. Nope.
So love, I don't think you deserve any sympathy over your losses
based upon poor judgement. Nobody has given me any except to
perhaps offer to sell me another ship which I may or may have not
accepted. I am sorry for your losses but not still for what I
consider chosing the wrong time of day to go out of locals. Still,
rather than hold yourself accountable all I heard in your letter
was blame this one and blame that one and nothing about hey what
could have i done to evade them or to choose a time to depart or to
not let anyone know when I was leaving/ You know I never tell
anybody what my plans are either and I I showed you measures which
I hope you observed en route. There are pilots whose sport is to
challenge anyone who will to combat. Although it is inconvenient
to us, that's their sport and when you take it personally, this
just feeds their egos. Haven't you heard Anton challenging others
before? For him, it's fun and although you don't see it that way
and I find it to be a royal pain in the butt, that is how it is.
so i certainly understand wanting to take a stronger ship into
Sector 12 if there is an Invasion but there is also the ITPN
particularly when there is that much hostile activity in the
sector. A good practice too is that BCs should actually be taken
to Jump Hub or another neutral location as well to crew but isn't
always done. So don't point fingers at me! I'm trying to relate
some practical survival advice to you yet you always seem to resent
it when someone like myself has had a bit of life and survival
experience and your not wanting to accept and to listen will not
help you much. only you can decide that perhaps there are others
who do know something based upon real experience.
As for the exact circumstances of your lost gunship, still, you
need to step back and get off of the defensive and accept it that
you indeed made tactical errors. That if others such as myself
consider how you mis-managed things don't agree with you, then that
is how it is. It does not mean that I love you any less. However,
I'm not very impressed with the logic behind what you have done at
times. You have lost two gunships in less than a half a year. I
sympathize with the loss of your droids as that was just a mean-
spirited thing on the part of that jerk.
As I have told you before, going to a commonly hunted ground out of
37 is not wise. If you do so, then you need to be willing to take
on the adversities. It is unfortunate but it is just a reality of
being a pilot in this universe. Nobody promised us that we would
live a perfect life here without any challenges.
As for going out of locals, you know I don't do that to run away
but because i enjoy it. still, others perception of you is when
you are angry or upset, that is what you do. As it's typical of
others who are newer pilots and don't engage in pilot versus pilot
combat. I'm not saying you should, just what is the perception
right or wrong.
You know exactly why I choose to go where nobody else goes to
Aquatic, Atmo and Gas salvage. Although it would be fun to be in a
community setting, it's just asking to be attacked so why put
yourself in that position? It's like here I am boys and girls!
come get me! That makes no sense at all! However, if you can
defend your ship and resources, then go where you want to go and be
ready to fight if you have to.
You need to remind yourself exactly why I wanted to take you out of
Locals as it was to enjoy some quality time with you and to not
have any interference so that we could make an attempt to work out
our differences.
Since I had so little quality time withyou until you ran off with
that self-serving individual who yes, how hypocritical, is not
available as much as i was and am. You said she was right by your
side heh well after what 4 days she hasn't been right there by your
side? So a very unfounded justification to hold over my head. I
might have been away for a day or so but I always came right back
to be right there with you. On many occasions, I would be
available for you and wait for at least an hour or two for you to
come home and then it seemed convenient that you wanted me to
become more intimate when you well knew I would sleep soon. It
makes me wonder if it's you who didn't want to take the time to
become more intimate. Still Love, I'd truly like to know what it
would be like to make love with you.
As for supporting you and upholding your dignity, then you will
always have every ounce of my very being to support you if I truly
know that you are using your head and reasonable judgement. Then
you are dignified and deserve to be respected. If you were still
here so I could be by your side, yes I would fight for you but I
nor anyone can't fight battles over circumstances that you created.
You know that I was not in favor of your joining Insanity but you
did so without even discussing it and I suppose had you done so
and I opposed it, that you would have just stomped out angrily,
slammed the door and then perhaps I could just say 'I told you so'.
You know I was initially tempted to join but thought better of it
as I knew that all they would want to do would be to exploit me.
That is one thing that Matt never did to me nor anyone in Force.
He didn't like families and cliques either although couples were
ok. He had some very sound ideas and he did not exploit anyone but
one thing about Matt which was of utmost importance is loyalty. I
did not get the sense that Cria or Fawkes cared anything about
loyalty which is another reason I did not choose to join. I will
likely remain as a member of Force until it is gone or if Matt
comes back and a group of great pilots and a few pirates band
together once again.
So sorry my sweet love, love is tough at times and it should be
because if I continuously supported certain aspects, then how do
you consider this to help you out? It is what they call enabling.
That is not support. Still, if Ihappened to be flying with you and
you were under attack, I wouldn't just sit back and let it happen
to you. If you are implying that I can do anything about Cria and
Fawkes, well sorry Love, I'm in no better circumstances than you.
I know that ifever i let my guard down, they will find a way to
take advantage. When they do though, I will either find a means to
retaliate which is highly unlikely or accept the consequences and
reflect and consider what I should do and defintiely should do
different to prevent a reoccurance of the same circumstances. I
may not succeed but there is nobody to blame but myself for
creating a situation for myself which left me vulnerable. I
wouldn't blame you as you are so hurtfully are blaming me for your
problems. I am accountable to Kitty and if someone loves her and
is available to help her then she is forever grateful. If they
aren't or choose not to, then I don't hold it against them.
You have a

Donating
--------------------------------------------------
NOTICE: If you mistakenly made a payment, PLEASE CONTACT ALBORI. You can ASSIST or e-mail albori@toastsoft.net. I will refund the money. If you reverse the payment in PayPal, I will have to pay a large fee because it looks like I ripped you off. Since that's not the case, please do not file a chargeback with PayPal. Instead, contact me and I will refund your money. That process is free for both sides. Thank you for your consideration.

For more complete information on donating (including how to donate), please see: http://toastsoft.net/donating.php

NOTE: Please be aware that ALL UPGRADES are available to EVERYBODY, despite their donator status. Donating merely gains you access to a more convenient way to obtain the upgrades. They are all in one place rather than flying to 50 different planets. Miriani is a free game and donating merely provides you with conveniences and little things that make no real difference to the game. You will never be expected to pay to receive advanced technology.

This donation program is liable to change or discontinue at any time. If the service were to discontinue, refunds will not be issued. By participating in the donator program or Miriani (or TSPM), you must follow all rules and policies outlined on the appropriate websites and on the MOO itself. Failure to comply with the policies can result in the termination of your donator status without a refund. Please note that the administrators reserve the right to cancel your donator membership at any time they see fit and any decisions made by them are final. By donating, you indicate that you have read and agree to any of the terms and conditions outlined here.

Donator Benefits:

* A big happy super special thank you combined with a warm fuzzy feeling!
* Access to special donator tradesman events (and possibly even the ability to request a tradesman). Tradesman are people who will make custom items for you, which may or may not include custom verbs. For instructions on requesting a tradesman, please see below.
* Access to an all-in-one starship upgrade center. Tell them what you want and they'll get it for you. Note: This service will not work fully during war time, depending on alliance relations between your alliance and the alliance supplying the upgrades.
* Access to a convenient shopping nexus that provides access to all of your favorite gadgets and items in one place.
* Feel special by gaining entrance into a special area reserved for donators, including private apartments, fine dining and special items not found anywhere else in the galaxy.
* Private apartments will (eventually) include private garages, also, as a donator we will customize the descriptions in your apartment if you wish. (After having us customize them, if you wish to change it, don't use the automated description tool on the room unless you wish to completely get rid of the description we made, instead, call for us again.)

Donator Tradesman Rules:

* The tradesman has the right to say no and will do so if you ask for any item that requires points to get, unless if you're modifying an item you already bought.
* Items that allow you to stun others will also not be allowed unless it is again modifying something you already own or is very very limited stun time (someone gets 3 seconds while you get one).
* Tradesman items require a rather large amount of time to be created, especially when we have many requests at once. Therefore, we will give our best effort to ensure donators get an item once every 30 days, however, this time frame is not a guarantee as sometimes it may take longer for the item to be completed. That said, the 30 days between items starts upon receipt of the requested item.
* Items you request will not necessarily be done at the moment you request them, but will get done as promptly as possible. 
* Most, if not all, requests will require a small amount of in-game currency.

Tradesman Certificates:

Tradesman certificates are to be seen as OOC items that are redeemed for an IC tradesman item (such as a pet, baby, roller coaster, large cupcake, etc). Because they are to be considered OOC, we do not want anyone to mention them on IC communicators. They are to be treated similarly to host applications. Although 
02:47 you can receive them in the game, you understand they are a means to an OOC purpose and are not to be mentioned in the game.
Please see HELP TRADESMAN CERTIFICATES for specific rules encompassing tradesman certificates.

Refunds:

If you mistakenly donate, please contact us immediately at hosts@toastsoft.net. We're able, and willing, to reverse the transaction with PayPal without anybody incurring any fees. It's important that you don't initiate a chargeback on your credit card, as this will cause unnecessary fees and complications for both sides. Simply e-mail us and we can have PayPal cancel the payment and return your money fee free.

We will only refund donations one week after receiving them, provided you have not taken advantage of the donator benefits outlined above.

Please be aware that we will NOT reimburse you for accumulated donator time. This means that if you have two months of donator time remaining, you CANNOT request that we send you $10 in exchange for removing your donator time. Donations are not to be considered savings accounts, prepaid credit cards, bank accounts, ATMs, or any other service that allows you access to funds on a whim.
