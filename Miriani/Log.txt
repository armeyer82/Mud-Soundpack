["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured
porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent
seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a
transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an
ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, an overstuffed
turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, Hissy the droid, a

["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the
lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours
into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the
expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror,
a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing
down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears
to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to
do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window,
you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured
porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent
seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a
transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an
ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, an overstuffed
turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, Hissy the droid, a
black cat, a glowing security drone, a glowing medical drone, a slim blue
medical drone, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a transparent trash can, a
turquoise refrigerator, a hot pink refrigerator, Kalista the droid, Mekensie the
droid, Kitcat the droid, and a printout of the service record for "Mischief"
here.
You can go south, down, and out.
l table
A transparent seashell white glass low table
You see nothing special.
You see an enormous bag of mouse flavored cat food, a single lavender-blue
African violet set in a large porcelain pot, an empty purple coffee mug, an
empty grey striped kitty mug, a peasant aqua beaded sweater, a light yellow lace
underwire bra, a sky blue cashmere sweater, and a huggable silky light purple
stuffed kitten on it.

["Mischief" Control Room] (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the
lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours
into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the
expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror,
a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing
down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears
to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to
do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window,
you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured
porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent
seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a
transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an
ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, an overstuffed
turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, Hissy the droid, a
black cat, a glowing security drone, a glowing medical drone, a slim blue
medical drone, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a transparent trash can, a
turquoise refrigerator, a hot pink refrigerator, Kalista the droid, Mekensie the
droid, Kitcat the droid, and a printout of the service record for "Mischief"
here.
You can go south, down, and out.

This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or
two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within
reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than
regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. The overhead
fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window,
you see the ship is at "Tibo2" Docking Bay.

["Tibo" Control Room]
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or
two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within
reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than
regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. The overhead
fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window,
you see the ship is at "Tibo2" Docking Bay.

["Mischief" Control Room] (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the
lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours
into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the
expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror,
a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing
down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears
to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to
do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window,
you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured
porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent
seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a
transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an
ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, an overstuffed
turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, Hissy the droid, a
black cat, a glowing security drone, a glowing medical drone, a slim blue
medical drone, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a transparent trash can, a
turquoise refrigerator, a hot pink refrigerator, Kalista the droid, Mekensie the
droid, Kitcat the droid, and a printout of the service record for "Mischief"
here.
You can go south, down, and out.

#help delay
Command: #delay {seconds} {command}
Command: #delay {name} {command} {seconds} 

         Delay allows you to have tintin wait the given amount of seconds
         before executing the given command. tintin won't wait before
         executing following input commands if any.

         Floating point precision for miliseconds is possible.

Example: #showme first;#delay {1} {#showme last}
         This will print 'first', and 'last' around one second later.

Comment: If you want to remove a delay with the #undelay command you can add
         a name as the first argument, be aware this changes the syntax.

This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or
two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within
reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than
regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. There appears
to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to
do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the
ship is at "Tibo" Docking Bay.

["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Planet 239174.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Planet 239174.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Planet 239174.

How about a feature for broadcasting like a live stream of somewhere? It could
work like a droid camera works in a way, maybe it could even be an upgrade for a
droid that would let you send the camera stream to multiple sources or
something. The basic idea I was thinking would be a mix of a droid remote with
like metafrequency type stations, so your droid could broadcast on 123.45 and
anyone tuning in on that frequency with their device could link in and view the
live broadcast of what the droid camera was seeing. This could lead to some
really creepy and funny things.
Please?

I don't know how useful this would actually be, but for the amusement factor
alone, I give it two thumbs up.

Control Control
["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured
porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent
seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a
transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an
ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, an overstuffed

#help switch
Command: #switch {conditional} {arguments}

         The switch command works similar to the switch statement in other
         languages. When the 'switch' command is encountered its body is parsed
         and each 'case' command found will be compared to the conditional
         argument of the switch and executed if there is a match.

         If the 'default' command is found and no 'case' statement has been
         matched the default command's argument is executed.

Example: #switch {1d4} {#case 1 cackle;#case 2 smile;#default giggle}

is a white tiled floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose

["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured
porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent

constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates
from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The
overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.
Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet.

help channel
Command help: CHANNEL - Allows you to enable, disable, authorize and deauthorize
people on the starship's communication relay if it is equipped with such an
upgrade.
That matches multiple help files. Please be more specific:

[2] Secondary Topic: Beta Channel
Enter your selection:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

--------------------------------------------------
Beta Channel
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax: BETA <message | on | off | help>
  Introduction
The beta channel is a strictly out of character channel that is utilized to
discuss upcoming game changes or balancing. It is not a place for hellos,
speaking about IC events, or circumventing regular communicators. Before using
the beta channel for the first time, you will be required to acknowledge this,
and will subsequently receive three further warnings to make absolutely certain
you understand the limitations of this channel and why it is here. Furthermore,
you cannot initiate a discussion if a host hasn't spoken recently. This hard
restriction is in place to prevent flagrant misuse while staff may not be
available. Not reading the rules below and the warnings provided is not an
excuse for misuse.
To peruse past beta conversations, you can use the @BETA-LOGS command or point
your web browser to http://toastsoft.net:1111/beta_history/. If you wish to
speak anonymously, type @BETA-MASK. Other commands can be listed by using the
HELP argument with the BETA command.
  Rules
*  Do not use this channel as an IC vector to communicate from out of
communications range.
* Do not ask questions that would yield IC information that your character would
otherwise not know. For example, if you hear people discussing a ship that
wasn't available when you were last in communications range, it is probably best
to not involve yourself since your character wouldn't know about the new ship.
* Do not abuse anonymity to manipulate a conversation in your favor. This covers
talking to your anonymous self to make it appear an idea might be favorable, or
proposing an idea and then turning on your beta mask to agree with yourself.
* To prevent spam, try to refrain from short answers such as "That's cool" or "I
like it". Since many players may be connected to the beta channel at one given
time, excessive messages of people agreeing will only serve to annoy. The only
exception to this rule is if someone specifically asks for agreement or
disagreement.
* Do not use the beta channel to report bugs or ask for a host. If you encounter
a bug, use the REPORT-command. If you require a host's attention, use the
ASSIST-command. The only exception to this is if a host asks for information on
a bug.
Violation of any of the rules above will result in a harsh warning and then
permanent removal from the channel. We are extremely serious about abuse of this
channel, as its OOC nature can serve to shatter IC immersion.
--------------------------------------------------
help relay
--------------------------------------------------
Starship Communication Relay
--------------------------------------------------
A starship communication relay is a transmitter that allows your ship to relay
transmissions to authorized users up to 10 lightyears away. Essentially it's a
private communication channel centered around a starship crew rather than a
private organization or an alliance. The relay itself must be constructed with
the asteroid mining construction facility. Once you have the upgrade installed,
the following commands apply:
CHANNEL - When used in the control room, allows you to enable/disable the relay,
authorize communicators, and deauthorize communicators. 
TR SHIP <message> - Transmits to the ship's private channel.
NOTE: The relay will only function within 10 lightyears of the ship.

Control Control
["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Frequently Rejected Suggestions and Ideas
help rejected
--------------------------------------------------
Frequently Rejected Suggestions and Ideas
--------------------------------------------------
Over the course of Miriani's lifetime, there have been hundreds of suggestions
made to improve the game. While we appreciate all suggestions, there are several
that we find come up often but don't fit into the game. This help file will
attempt to detail those suggestions so that we can avoid them coming up again
and again. If you have a suggestion for an often suggested suggestion, feel free
to suggest (HA HA HA) its inclusion in this list by REPORTing it.
* Decreasing debris transfer time - Salvaging is an extremely easy and lucrative
venture. Part of the balance of the activity, which is extremely easy, is that
it takes a while to transfer all of the debris.
* Idle timer - We see no point in booting players when they've been idle for a
certain amount of time. They aren't really hurting anybody. We compromised here
and added @WHO UNIDLE.
* Engineering bonus - Engineering is a task so simple that, the majority of the
time, the job entails sitting around doing nothing or typing a single command
during a battle. It would prove to be excessive to reward people for doing
nothing.
* List of active hosts - The hosts have several demands on their time, real life
included. A list of active hosts would only prompt an excess in assists and
special requests.
* Removing PvP - Player versus player combat is an integral part of Miriani.
Removing it would be like tuning your television to a channel that plays the
same infomercial on repeat all day every day. It may be a funny, entertaining
infomercial at first, but eventually it's tedious and boring.
* Making PvP optional - Optional PvP is similar to removing it entirely. The
majority of players would disable it, or enable it only when convenient, which
would create enormous nonsensical disparities in the game. It not only doesn't
make any in-character sense, but out of character it punishes the people who
like PvP by essentially eliminating it.
* Ability to join unregistered alliance - An unregistered alliance would have no
benefits of a typical alliance, such as colonized planets, High Guard protection
(and missions), starships, a central currency, etc. It would essentially be like
wishing you were homeless.
* Ability to join HG - While the High Guard is comprised of members from all of
the alliances working together in joint cooperation, it's more of a way to
facilitate in character events and missions. The High Guard develops and deploys
advanced technologies that we don't wish players to have access to except for
during special events.
* Removing stunning - Stunning, while not the best thing in the world, is part
of the PvP of the game.
* Making it so someone can't hold you while stunned - This would eliminate
stranding and doesn't make a lot of sense.
* Super ships that include everything - Starships are extremely complex pieces
of machinery. The larger the ship, the more advanced the electronics, and the
more room it takes. We're still relatively new to the ship building business, so
we haven't quite gotten miniaturization down. And, OOCly, we don't want
overpowered ships that can be manned by a single player. It's a multiplayer game
and we like cooperation.
* Ability to mask who you are - This would be quite annoying and provide even
more room for players to be cruel to other players with no consequences. We have
enough ways for that as it is.
* Being able to beat people up without a weapon, causing injuries or stuntime -
There is a massive thread on this topic that covers it better than I ever could.
USE your message board reader and type: GOTO 183
* Drugs - Put simply, we don't approve of drug usage and, while it may be
prevalent in the real world, it's not prevalent here. It's illegal and enforced
quite handily by the alliances.
* Artifact retrieval droids - Artifact retrieval is already one of the easiest
and most rewarding activities in the game. Drones that automatically retrieve
artifacts would make it an overwhelming activity, bringing in billions of
credits and leaving everybody out of communications range all the time.
* Stun/injury grenades for player use - These would be seriously overpowered and
have little or no defense, allowing a single player to incapacitate large groups
of defenseless players.
* Voyagers getting medical bays - Not all ships are perfect. Sometimes an old
design is made obsolete by new technology.
* Being able to add extra rooms to ships - Ships are ships! You can't really
build on to them without compromising them.
* Portable starship registries - For security reasons, the ship registry is only
accessible from approved terminals on protected planets. OOCly, we want you to
get out and stretch your legs.
* Official OOC channel - We feel that an OOC channel would not only be a
nightmare to moderate, but it would also shatter any immersive element to the
game and lead to the game's systems becoming a background activity to the chat
room that the OOC channel is. We prefer Miriani to be a game, not a glorified
AOL chatroom.
* Sending mail from a starship, apartment, or house - This falls in line with
several other 'convenience suggestions' that would reduce travel. We feel that
players should be required to fly around the game and explore. If everything can
be done from an apartment, we have failed in our goal to get players out into
the game interacting with others. Even the simple act of sending mail requires
you to get out of your ship and hopefully encounter other people.
* Remove babies from the game- Sorry, it's not happening.
* Simulators for atmospheric combat - We prefer to keep atmospheric combat
challenging for as long as possible.

Control Control
["Mischief" Control Room] (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional
sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously
have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of
the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of
the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that
are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of
redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely
noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is
casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet,
covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous
oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear
waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the
wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
